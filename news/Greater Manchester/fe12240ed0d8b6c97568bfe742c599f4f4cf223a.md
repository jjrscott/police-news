Police investigating after a man was shot in Wigan have made an arrest.

At around 4.20pm on Thursday 19 September 2019, police received a report that a man had been shot on Bickershaw Lane.

The victim, a man in his 50s, was sitting in a parked Range Rover when a black Audi S3 pulled up alongside.

A shotgun was discharged, injuring the man in the Range Rover in his arm and hand.

The black Audi S3 then left the scene.

The man was taken to hospital with life-changing injuries. He has since been released.

Police have arrested a 28-year-old man on suspicion of attempted murder.

He has been bailed pending further enquiries.

Police are continuing to appeal for information following the shooting.

Detective Chief Inspector Cheryl Chatterton, from GMP's Major Incident Team said: "Our enquiries remain ongoing and I would urge anyone with information to get in touch as soon as possible.

"Perhaps you saw the black Audi S3 prior to or after the shooting. If you know something that can assist our investigation, please make contact with police."
