Police are continuing to appeal for information after a man died following a collision on Tennyson Road in Bolton.

Shortly before 8.15am on Monday 2 March 2020 emergency services were called to Tennyson Road to reports of a collision involving a pedestrian and a dark grey VW Golf car.

Despite the best efforts of medical staff, the pedestrian, a 26-year-old man, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

The VW car was abandoned after the incident and the offenders fled prior to police arrival.

Detective Sergeant Fiona Manning of GMP's Major Incident Team said: "We are continuing to investigate the sequence of events before and after this collision, during which a man sadly lost his life.

"We would ask anyone who witnessed this collision or has any information to get in touch with police as soon as possible.

"We would particularly like to speak to a man who contacted police twice on the day of the incident but did not leave any details.

"We would like to ask this man to make contact with us as a matter of urgency."

Anyone with information should contact 0161 856 2270 quoting incident number 1829 of 02/03/2020, or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
