**Did you witness a robbery in Manchester?

At around 11.50am on Monday 10 August 2020, police were called to Dudley Road, Whalley Range in Manchester to reports of a robbery.

Enquiries established that a 71-year-old man had been walking from his house to his car when he was approached by a man who forcibly grabbed a bag the victim was carrying.

During the altercation the elderly man fell to the floor causing him to dislocate his elbow and leaving him with injuries to his face and knees, which required treatment at hospital.

The offender made off on foot towards College Road, Whalley Range.

Enquiries remain ongoing.

DI Chris Aunins of GMP's City of Manchester division, said: "This was a cowardly and opportunistic attack in which an elderly gentleman has been left with multiple injuries.

"GMP takes offences like this incredibly seriously and we want to take this opportunity to appeal to anyone who may have been in the area at that time. Did you witness anything suspicious on that day or do you have information that could help police with our enquiries? "
