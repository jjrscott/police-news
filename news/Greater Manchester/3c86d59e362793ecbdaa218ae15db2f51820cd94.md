Police have released an image of a man they would like to speak to in connection with a burglary in Bolton.

The burglary occurred at around midday on Thursday 9 January 2020 at an address in School Hill.

A man entered a house in School Hill whilst the owner of the property - an 80-year-old-woman - went outside to close her garden gate. A handbag was stolen which contained a bank card that has been used to withdraw funds from the owner's account.

No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing.

Police Constable Catherine Jackson of GMP's Bolton District said: "This was a callous offence in which a vulnerable woman has been robbed of personal items in her own home.

"I understand that this incident happened over a month ago but our officers have been following every line of enquiry and are doing all they can to find those responsible. As a result, we have been able to release this image in the hope of talking to the man in this photograph.

"If you recognise this man or were in School Hill at the time of the incident and saw anything unusual or suspicious that that could help with our investigations please contact police."

Anyone with any information about the burglary should contact police on 0161 856 5761 quoting incident number 001385 of 09/01/2020.

Information can be passed on anonymously by calling the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
