Rescue dog PD Jake, has sprung into action after passing his assessment with flying colours and is now a fully-fledged police dog.

Part of the team @GMPDogs - Jake, a 19-month old Belgian Malinois, came to Greater Manchester Police from a rescue centre in Cumbria after staff thought he'd make an excellent police dog.

It was a match made in heaven when Jake was introduced to PC Andy Cale who had been looking for a new dog.

PC Andy Cale said: "I've had three dogs before Jake, with one funnily enough also being called Jake, but he's the first rescue I've had and he's been an excellent dog to train. He's very quick and extremely sharp - he'll be well suited to the streets of Greater Manchester.

"I'm really proud of him today - he's passed his assessment with flying colours and I can't wait to get him out in the field."

PD Jake's assessment including tracking, open ground and building searching, obedience and agility work followed by a full round of criminal work.
