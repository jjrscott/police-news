Officers were called just before 8.45am on Thursday 21 January 2021 to a report of a road traffic collision on the M60 close to junction 20.

Emergency services attended and enquiries established a Kia Ceed and a lorry had both been travelling northbound on the M60 when they collided with one another in lane one of the motorway.

Despite the best efforts of medical staff, the driver of the Kia - a 38-year-old woman - was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

A 33-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by driving without due care and attention. He remains in custody for questioning.
Enquiries are ongoing.

Police Constable Karl Horner of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "Very sadly a woman has died following this collision and our thoughts go out to her family and loved ones as they begin to process this incredibly difficult news. Our specialist officers continue to provide support for them.

"We're appealing to anyone who may have been driving on the M60 at the time of the incident - or who witnessed the collision - to come forward and assist police with our enquiries. Any information, no matter how large or small could prove vital to our investigation.

"We are particularly keen to speak to anyone who may have dash-cam footage from around the time of the collision."

Anyone with information should contact GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 0161 856 4741, quoting incident number 628 of 21/01/2021. Alternatively, details can be passed on anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
