Officers from GMP's Transport Unit have arrested a 29-year-old man on suspicion of racially aggravated section 4 public order. He remains in custody to be questioned by police.

Police were made aware of a video circulating online of a passenger being seen to be using racist language on a tram on the Bury Metrolink line at around 5.45pm on Saturday 7 December 2019 before alighting at Radcliffe tram stop.

Chief Inspector Matt Bailey-Smith, of GMP's Transport Unit, said: "Racism of any form is wrong and will not be tolerated in our society.

"As a Transport Unit we are determined to ensure that anyone who feels they have experienced any form of racial abuse or intimidation on public transport can contact police, with the confidence that we will act swiftly to bring those responsible to justice."
