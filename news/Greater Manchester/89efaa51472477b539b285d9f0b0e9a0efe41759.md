Detectives have released images of a man they would like to speak to following reports of an imposter posing as a handyman in Bury.

On Wednesday 1 April 2020 at around 11:45am a man approached a 92-year-old woman's address on Cemetery Road in Ramsbottom and asked if she would like repairs to guttering on her property.

The man entered the address and demanded she hand over cash. The woman refused and the man left the property empty handed.

No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Constable Christian Prince of GMP's Bury District said: "We are aware that this may cause concern to members of the local community but I want to reassure people that we are doing everything possible to trace the person or persons responsible.

"After following several lines of enquiries we have released these images in the hope that someone will be able to help.

"During this unprecedented and difficult time while the country remains in lockdown, our officers are keen to make people aware of these incidents so they are informed and can remain vigilant.

"If you have any information about this incident or saw anything unusual or suspicious in the area please get in contact with police as soon as possible."

Information can be given to police by calling 0161 856 8126 quoting incident number 697 of 01/04/2020.

Alternatively, information can be passed on to the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
