At around 1am on Saturday 7 March 2020, police received a report that a man had been stabbed at a premises on St Petersgate.

Officers attended and enquiries established that there had been an argument involving several people and a member of the public, who had intervened, had been slashed with a cut throat razor blade.

Philip McKinney (25/09/81), of no fixed abode, was arrested and taken into police custody for questioning, where he was charged.

Following a two-day trial, McKinney was found guilty and today (Monday 1 February 2021) was sentenced at Bolton Crown Court to seven years imprisonment for assault and possession of an offensive weapon.

DC Paul Garner, of GMP's Stockport district, said: "Taking a cut throat razor blade on a night out is completely unacceptable, as is using it to injure someone - particularly a member of the public who had intervened in an argument in an attempt to protect others.

"I hope this case warns offenders that GMP and the justice system will not tolerate this kind of behaviour and also reassures members of the public that we are committed to establishing the full circumstances surrounding incidents and bringing criminals to court."
