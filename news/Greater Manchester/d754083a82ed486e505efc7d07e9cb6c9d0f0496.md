Shortly before 4am on Saturday 12 December 2020, police were called by the fire service who were responding to a fire at an address on Devon Road in Partington.

Emergency services attended and the fire was extinguished.

No-one was injured but damage has been caused to three properties.

The fire is being treating as arson and is believed to have started at the back of one of the properties before spreading up into the loft area.

Two men- aged 49 and 47 - have been arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life. They remain in custody for questioning.

Detective Sergeant John Seaton, of GMP's Trafford district, said: "This fire spread across three separate properties where children were present, sleeping in their beds at the time.

"Fortunately no one was injured during this reckless attack, however the consequences of this fire could have been disastrous.

"Although we have made two arrests, our investigation is still ongoing and I would like to appeal to anyone who may have witnessed this attack or have any information surrounding this fire to please contact police as soon as possible."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 7527 quoting incident number 453 of 12/12/2020.
