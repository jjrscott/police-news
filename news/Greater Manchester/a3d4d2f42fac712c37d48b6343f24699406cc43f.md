CCTV

At around 8pm on Friday 20 November 2020, police were called to a report of a robbery at a premises on Chapel Street, Leigh.

Officers attended and established that two men had entered the shop - one carrying a machete, the other a knife. The pair confronted a member of staff and demanded money before searching the counter area.

The men left via Clifford Street with a quantity of cash from the till.

No one was injured.

An investigation is underway.

DC Andrew Partington, of GMP's Wigan district, said: "This was a frightening experience for the member of staff. Thankfully, they weren't injured but they have, understandably, been impacted by what happened.

"We are releasing this CCTV in the hope that a member of the public recognises one or both of the men's clothing and can help us identify them. If that's you, I'd ask you to contact us without hesitation."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 7056 quoting 2458 20/11/20 or the independent charity - Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
