At 5pm on Monday 1 February 2021, police received a report that a woman had been assaulted by a man whilst walking in the Cheadle area.

An investigation was launched and enquiries established that, between 4pm and 5pm, the woman was walking on a path near Willow Avenue when the man, who was passing, pushed her over.

The victim sustained an arm injury.

The man is described as being white, approximately 5ft 10in, of a 'stocky/ chubby' build and over 30-years-old with short mousey/ dark coloured hair and a 'flat' face. At the time of the incident, he was wearing a charcoal coloured jacket.

DC Laura Burgess, of GMP's Stockport district, said: "The victim sustained an arm injury for which she is having surgery today. We hope that she will make a fast and full recovery.

"It's highly likely that there were others nearby at the time who saw this assault or the offender before or afterwards - I appeal to them to contact us or Crimestoppers anonymously."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 9976 quoting 1997 01/02/21 or the independent charity - Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
