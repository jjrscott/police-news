At around 7.45am today (Friday 24 January 2020), officers were called to reports of a collision involving a vehicle and pedestrian on Lord Sheldon Way, Ashton-under-Lyne.

Emergency services attended and the pedestrian, who is in his 50s, was taken to hospital with serious injuries. He remains in a serious but stable condition.

The driver of the car stopped at the scene.

No arrests have been made

An investigation is underway and police are appealing for information or dash cam footage.

PC Philip Shaw, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the victim as he receives hospital treatment and we investigate the collision.

"Lord Sheldon Way is a busy road, especially during rush hour, so we are hopeful there will be people who saw this collision or have dash cam footage and can assist us with our enquiries.

"I would also like to appeal to anyone who saw a grey Seat Leon being driven through nearby area in the minutes prior to the collision to contact us."

Anyone with information should contact GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 0161 856 4741.

Alternatively, the independent charity - Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
