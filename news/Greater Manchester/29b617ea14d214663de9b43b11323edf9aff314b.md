Shortly before 11.20pm on Wednesday 4 November 2020, police were called to reports of an aggravated burglary at a shop on King Street in Delph.

Three men - who were wielding weapons - forced entry to the shop before using an explosive device to steal cash from an ATM machine which was located inside the store.

The offenders made off in a Audi S3 heading towards Oldham town centre.

A substantial amount of cash was taken and damage was caused to the store front.

All three men are described as wearing dark clothing with hoods, face coverings and gloves.

No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Constable Sarah Hay, of GMP's Oldham district, said: "This was a carefully planned and brazen attack in which the offenders showed complete disregard for the property before making off with a quantity of cash.

"We are appealing for anyone who may have any information about this burglary, or anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed anything suspicious to please contact police as soon as possible."

Anyone with information can contact police on 0161 856 9080 quoting incident number 3167 of 4/11/2020.

Reports can also be made anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
