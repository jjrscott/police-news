e-fit

At around 3.35am on Friday 18 December 2020, police were called to a report of a burglary on Parsonage Road, Heaton Moor.

Officers attended and established that the victim had woken up to see a man standing at his bedroom door. The victim chased the man and discovered that he was in possession of a small kitchen knife. A short time later, the victim's wife ran down the stairs and the couple pushed the intruder out of the front door.

During the struggle, the victim sustained minor arm, hand and leg injuries.
At the time of the incident, the offender was wearing dark-coloured clothing and had his hood up.

An investigation is underway and police believe the burglary might be linked to an earlier incident on Gibsons Road, during which a man smashed a window and tried to force his way in to a property whilst holding a weapon described as a knife or screwdriver. No one was injured.

DC Kristy Hamlet, of GMP's Stockport district, said: "Although no one was seriously injured in either of these incidents, they were frightening experiences for the families who live in the properties. No one should feel scared in their own home.

"During both incidents, the offender shouted alarming threats at the victims.

"We are releasing this e-fit in the hope that a member of the public can help us identify the person responsible so we can arrest them and ensure they face justice. If you have any information which may assist, please contact us or Crimestoppers."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 9790 quoting 495 of 18/12/20 or the independent charity - Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
