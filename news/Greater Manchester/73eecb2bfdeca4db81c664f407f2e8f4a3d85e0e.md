Police investigating a series of sexual offences on trams in Manchester City Centre have released further CCTV footage of a man they'd like to speak to.

At 6.25pm on Thursday 31 October 2019, a 16-year-old girl reported that she'd been sexually assaulted on a tram between Piccadilly Gardens and Cornbrook.

At 3.20pm on Friday 15 November 2019, a 12-year-old girl reported that she'd been sexually assaulted on a tram between Piccadilly Gardens and Altrincham.

A few hours later, at 6.40pm, another young girl reported that she'd witnessed a man behaving inappropriately on a tram between Market Street and Old Trafford.

In December 2019, police released four images of a man police want to speak to in relation to the offences.

Officers have now released moving images of the man.

Sergeant Nick Bamber, of GMP's Transport Unit, said: "I'd like to thank those who have already been in touch following our previous appeal.

"However, despite a good response from the public, the man in the image remains outstanding and we are therefore releasing further footage today.

"We remain committed to speaking to this individual in connection with these offences and believe someone out there will be able to identify him.

"If you recognise him, or have any information that may assist us, please get in touch."
