Since 1 October 2020, Greater Manchester Police have seized over 20 electric scooters as part of a crackdown on their illegal use on roads, pavements, cycle lanes and other public places.

Despite the increased popularity in the use of e-scooters, GMP officers are reminding people that current laws only allow for them to be ridden on private land with the owner's permission. E-scooters used in public places can be seized by police, and riders may be prosecuted for operating a vehicle without insurance.

There is currently a trial ongoing in Salford in partnership with Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) and the University of Salford for the use of e-scooters. This allows for the legal use of Lime e-scooters in the designated trial area only.

Inspector Steve Bryant, from GMP's Safer Transport Team, said: "We want to ensure that people have the right information when it comes to e-scooters, particularly as many may buy or receive them for Christmas. We are aware that not all sellers make the regulations clear at the point of sale; therefore we will continue to raise awareness so that hard working people do not waste their money on something they cannot currently use.

"To ensure everyone is kept safe on our roads, our officers will be seizing e-scooters used illegally."
