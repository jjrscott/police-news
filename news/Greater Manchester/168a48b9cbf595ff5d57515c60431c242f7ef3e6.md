A man who stashed 1kg of cocaine worth around £100,000 in his kitchen bin has been jailed for six years.

Ryan Ridgway (06/05/1984) of Buxton Old Road, Disley was sentenced today (Thursday 18 June 2020) at Minshull Street Crown Court after pleading guilty to possession with intent to supply Class A cocaine.

On Thursday 20 February 2020 officers attended Ridgway's home address in Disley.

During a search of the property officers discovered a carrier bag hidden in a bin in the kitchen, inside of which was stashed 1kg of cocaine.

Also found in the main bedroom was £3,000 cash and several mobile phones.

Ridgway was arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply and money laundering later that day.

Detective Sergeant Leanne Banks of GMP's Programme Challenger in Stockport said: "The effects of cocaine can destroy communities and ruin lives.

"If sold as individual deals the cocaine Ridgway had concealed would have been worth around £100,000.

"Thanks to our officers conducting a thorough search of Ridgway's home these class A drugs have been taken off the streets of Manchester.

"I hope this result proves that we will continue to target those involved in organised crime and the supply of illegal drugs and we will take robust action against them."

Ryan Ridgway
