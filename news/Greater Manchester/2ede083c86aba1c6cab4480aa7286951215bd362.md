Officers are appealing for witnesses following a road traffic collision that left a woman with serious injuries in Manchester last week.

At approximately 7.10pm on Thursday 4 February, officers were called to a report of a road traffic collision involving two vehicles on Greenheys Lane West at the junction with Bold Street in Moss Side, Manchester.

The collision involved a silver VW Polo and a silver Vauxhall Corsa. A woman in the Vauxhall Corsa suffered serious injuries and remains in hospital in critical but stable condition. The driver from the VW Polo stopped at the scene and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

PC Steven Oliver, from GMP's Roads Policing Unit, said: "A woman has been left in a critical condition following this incident and we're doing all we can to establish the circumstances surrounding the collision.

"Our thoughts remain with the woman and her family as she continues to receive treatment in hospital. Our investigation is ongoing into this incident and we're urging anyone who may have witnessed the collision to come forward and help us with our enquiries.

"Anyone who has CCTV or dash-cam footage that may assist us with our investigation are also asked to come forward.

"Anyone with any information should call 0161 856 4765 quoting incident number 2501 04/02/21. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
