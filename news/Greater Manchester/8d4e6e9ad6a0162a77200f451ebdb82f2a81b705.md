Two men and a woman have been arrested by officers after seven puppies were stolen from Wigan.

Just after 2.30am yesterday (2 February 2021), officers were called to a report of a burglary on Shelley Street in Leigh.

Seven English Bulldogs were taken and were later discovered at an address in Liverpool after receiving a report of puppies being carried into an address on Marina Avenue in Merseyside.

Two 21-year-old men and a 20-year-old woman have been arrested on suspicion of burglary. They have since been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Sergeant Gareth Mark, of GMP's Wigan district, said: "Thanks to a vital report from a member of the public, the puppies have been rightfully returned to their owner after they were taken in Wigan.

"Their owners were understandably worried but thankfully, an eagle-eyed member of the public helped us to return them home.

"A number of lines of enquiry are still on-going into the incident and anyone with information can call 101 quoting incident number 602 of 03/02/2021. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
