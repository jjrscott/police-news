On Friday 19 June 2020 a team of officers executed warrants at four addresses in Westhoughton.

These warrants were executed following an incident in which an off-duty Police Constable was brutally attacked after identifying himself as a police officer in a situation where he was trying to help another person.

As a result of this attack, the police officer suffered with injuries to his face and ribs as well as a broken arm.

As part of this investigation, police have seized a number of evidential items including clothing and phones, which has led to the arrest of an 18-year-old man and four teenagers aged between 15 and 17. They have since bailed pending further investigation.

Detective Chief Inspector Dean Purtill, of GMPs Bolton division, said: "Yesterday's arrests are a testament to the hard work and dedication of the team here in Bolton who are working hard to ensure that those involved in this disgusting assault will pay the price for their actions.

"Our officers are committed to protecting the public and keeping our streets safe and absolutely do not deserve to be treated in this way.

"I would like to reassure the public that we are continuing to treat this incident seriously and are doing all we can to trace every single one of the offenders involved.

"I would like to stress that although we have a number of people in custody our investigation is still very much ongoing and I would encourage the public to come forward with any information that may assist our enquiries."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 5757, quoting incident number 3163 of 13/06/2020.

Reports can also be made anonymously to the independent Charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
