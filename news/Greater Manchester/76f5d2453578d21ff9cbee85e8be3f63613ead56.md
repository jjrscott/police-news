Cannabis farm uncovered in Bolton

Police in Bolton uncovered a cannabis farm worth half a million pounds.

Officers were called to a property on Wood Street at around 11am on Friday 22 January 2020.

They found around 900 plants weighing around 252 Kilos spread across six rooms.

The plants had an estimated street value of Â£500,000.

No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing.

Sergeant Tracy Tant of GMP's Bolton District said: "This result goes to show the importance of the public working alongside the police to report their concerns around drugs in the community.

"Thanks to intelligence received, we have been able to take a significant quantity of cannabis out of the supply chain, helping disrupt the income of organised criminals who seek to profit from the sale of drugs.

"If you suspect drugs are being grown or sold in your community, contact police immediately."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 5578 quoting 874 of 22/01/2021. Alternatively, details can be passed on anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
