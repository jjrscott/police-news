At around 9.30pm on Thursday 26 September 2019 police were called to reports of a fire at a building adjacent to St Mark with Christ Church on Glodwick Road, Oldham.

Emergency services attended and the fire was extinguished.

There was no damage to the main part of the church, however the community centre next door sustained damage.

Police are treating the incident as arson and are appealing for information.

Detective Sergeant Jason Byrne of GMP's Oldham District, said: "Thankfully, nobody was injured in the fire.

"I would like to reassure those affected that we will do all that we can to bring those responsible into custody.

"We would encourage anyone who may have been a witness or anyone who may know any details to come forward."

Anybody with information should contact police on 0161 856 1382, quoting incident number 3151 of 26/9/2019, or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
