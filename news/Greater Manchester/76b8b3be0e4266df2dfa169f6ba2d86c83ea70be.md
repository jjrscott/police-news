Maggie Smythe

The family of Maggie Smythe have paid tribute to her after two men were jailed following her disappearance and murder.

In a statement, her family said: "Maggie was a loving mother and aunt to her three children and niece. She was bright and bubbly and a best friend to all of us.

"She would do anything for anyone. Maggie would give you her last pound if you needed it.

"Maggie had her whole life ahead of her. Her loss has changed our lives forever and is something we will never get over.

"We visit the places Maggie used to go. We all still expect her to walk through the door and be the loveable girl that we all knew and loved.

"Her loss has left a hole in all our lives but our memories of Maggie will never be taken away.

"We will cherish them forever.

"We will always love her and we all miss her incredibly."

Today 6 September 2019, Christopher Taylor (10/07/1979) of Greenroyd Avenue in Bolton was handed a life sentence with minimum tariff of 24 years at Bolton Crown Court after a jury found him guilty of the murder of Maggie Smythe.

Brian Ottley (30/08/89), of no fixed address, was found guilty of assisting an offender and sentenced to 9 years in prison.
