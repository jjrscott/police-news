Appeal for information following firearm discovery in Levenshulme.

At around 6.30am on Saturday 2 January 2021 a firearm was discovered on Elmsworth Avenue, Levenshulme near to the steps of Levenshulme Baptist Church.

The firearm - a handgun - was discovered in a black carrier bag with ammunition by a member of the public in the area at the time.

Anyone with information in relation to the firearm is being urged to come forward and speak with police.

Detective Constable Martha Walker of GMP's City of Manchester division, said: "We extend our thanks to the gentleman who discovered the firearm and handed it in to police - it is thanks to him that we have been able to remove this potentially lethal weapon from our streets.

"This was left on a residential street so we're appealing to anyone in the area who may have witnessed anyone behaving suspiciously or carrying a black bag recently to speak with police. Any information, no matter how small, could greatly assist our investigation.

"There is absolutely no place for weapons such as this across Greater Manchester and we want to ensure that the owner is identified."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 6063 quoting incident number 764 of 02/01/21. Alternatively, details can be passed on anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
