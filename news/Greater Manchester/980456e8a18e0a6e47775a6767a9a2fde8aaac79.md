Arrest

Detectives investigating an attempted murder in Manchester have arrested a man.

At around 6.10pm on Tuesday 1 September 2020, police were called to reports of a stabbing at a superstore on Stockport Road in Levenshulme.

Enquiries have established that a 19-year-old man was chased into the store by a man who was wielding a knife.

Upon catching up with the victim, the man proceeded to stab the 19-year-old before making off.

Emergency services attended and the victim was taken to hospital with stab wounds to his back. He has since been discharged.

Officers have since arrested a 27-year-old man on suspicion of attempted murder. He remains in custody for questioning.

Detective Inspector Chris Maddocks, of GMP's City of Manchester district, said: "We're pleased to inform our communities that we have made an arrest in connection with what was a very vicious attack.

"I would like to thank the public who have assisted our enquiries since our last appeal and would like to stress that our work does not stop here - we will continue to follow every possible line of enquiry available to us."
