At around 3.05am on Tuesday 19 May 2020, police were called by the fire and rescue service responding to a report of a vehicle fire on Meadway.

Officers attended and established that the car had been set on fire using an accelerant and also found that a front window of a property had been smashed.

No one was injured.

An investigation is underway.

DC Mark Robertson, of GMP's Bury district, said: "Although this incident happened earlier this year, enquiries have been ongoing to establish the full circumstances and we are now trying to identify the men in the image.

"We are appealing for the public's help to do this - Are you one of the men in the image? Can you help us identify one, two or all of the men? If so, I ask you to contact us or Crimestoppers as soon as possible.

"I would, finally, like to use this opportunity to say that we are committed to identifying those responsible for this reckless behaviour, which could have had devastating consequences, and ensuring that they face justice."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 8223 quoting 293 of 19/05/20 or the independent charity - Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
