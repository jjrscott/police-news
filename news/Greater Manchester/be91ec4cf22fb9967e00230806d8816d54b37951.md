Shortly before 11.30pm on Monday 9 September 2019, police were called to reports of a collision involving a Silver Audi S3 and a Black BMW 1 Series on St Helens Road near to the junction with Plodder Lane.

Sadly, a 24-year-old man who was travelling in the BMW died in the collision and the driver of the Audi fled the scene.

Two men from Bolton, aged 23 and 27, were arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving but have since been bailed.

CCTV footage taken just prior to the collision captured two vehicles travelling at high speed along Derby St and St Helens Road.

Police are keen to speak to the female driver of a blue car that stopped at the scene and took a woman who was injured in the collision to Bolton hospital.

They are also keen to speak to the driver of a small red hatchback that stopped at the collision scene.

Sergeant Brian Orr, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "We are appealing for anyone that might have witnessed the two vehicles travelling along Derby St and St Helens Road prior to the collision which sadly resulted in a young man losing his life.

"We have released this footage in the hope that it may prompt witnesses to come forward.

"I would encourage any witnesses, or anyone with dashcam footage to get in touch as soon as possible."

Anyone with information should call GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 0161 856 4741 or 101 quoting incident number 3266 of 09/09/2019, or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
