Detectives have seized ammunition, firearms components and tools believed to be used in the manufacture of ammunition following a raid this morning (1 December 2020).

At around 8.30am, officers from GMP's Serious and Organised Crime Group executed a warrant on Walker Brow in Buxton as part of an on-going investigation into the supply of firearms and ammunition.

Following a search, a quantity of ammunition, firearms components including barrels and other tools believed to have been used in the illegal manufacture of ammunition were seized.

A 20-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm. He remains in custody at this time.

Detective Constable Christopher Chinnery, of GMP's Serious and Organised Crime Group, said: "This is a significant discovery as part of our commitment to tackle the use of firearms and gang-related crime in Greater Manchester.

"These items could have led to devastating consequences and we remain committed to tackling organised crime across Greater Manchester."
