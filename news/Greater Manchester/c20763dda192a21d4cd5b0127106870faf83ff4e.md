Shortly after 5.15pm on Saturday 11 January 2020, police were called to reports of a collision on Stockport Road between a red Mazda and a pedestrian.

Emergency services attended and the pedestrian - an 81-year-old woman - was taken to hospital where she sadly died a short time later from her injuries.

The driver remained at the scene to speak with officers and no arrests have been made.

Enquiries are ongoing.

Police Constable Pete Cunningham, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "Tragically an elderly woman has lost her life as a result of this collision and we are doing everything we can to support her family at this unimaginably difficult time.

"Our thoughts are very much with the woman's family as we continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding the collision.

"It happened at a relatively busy time of the day and I would urge any witnesses or anyone with any dash-cam or CCTV footage to get in touch as soon as possible."

Anyone with information should contact GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 0161 856 64741 or 101 quoting incident number 2138 of 11/01/2020, or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
