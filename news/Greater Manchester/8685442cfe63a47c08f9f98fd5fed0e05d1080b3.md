At around 5am this morning (Sunday 10 May 2020) police were called to reports that a silver VW Golf had collided with a wall on Hollinwood Avenue, Chadderton.

The driver - a 31-year-old woman - was taken to hospital with serious injuries, where she remains in a stable condition.

No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing.

Hollinwood Avenue was closed whilst investigation work was carried out, but has since been reopened.

"I would like to use this opportunity to appeal to anyone who may have any information or dash cam footage from the area at the time of the incident or shortly before to get in touch with police as soon as possible."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 8968, quoting incident number 523 of 10/05/20.
