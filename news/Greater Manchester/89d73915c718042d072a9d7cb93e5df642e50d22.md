An Oldham officer has set himself the challenge of running a half-marathon in his garden this Sunday to raise money for two charities.

PC Damieon Hartley-Pickles, from the Failsworth and Hollinwood Policing Team, will complete 418 laps of his back garden to raise money for NHS Charities Together and Mahdlo Youth Zone.

The officer regularly takes part in races up and down the country, usually donning a wheelbarrow, which led to him being nicknamed 'Barrowthonman'.

PC Damieon Hartley-Pickles said: "I love a challenge and often participate in races up and down the country to raise money for my chosen charities.

"Understandably all of my planned fundraising races have been postponed or cancelled so I had a think about how I could continue to raise money and quickly decided to complete a race in my garden instead.

"Running a half-marathon in my own garden is a first for me but I'm hoping to raise Â£1,000 for two very worthy charities who both do fantastic work and need our help more than ever."
