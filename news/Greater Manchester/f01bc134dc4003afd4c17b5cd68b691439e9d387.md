At around 2.40am on Sunday 20 September 2020, police were called to Lees Road following reports that a person was laying in the road.

Officers attended and a woman in her 30s was taken to hospital where she remains with life-threatening injuries.

Enquiries have established that there was a collision involving the pedestrian and a white Vauxhall Corsa. The driver of the Corsa failed to stop at the scene. The car has also since been recovered by officers in the Oldham area.

A 22-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.

Sergeant Darren Hancock, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "Our thoughts remain with the woman who is currently in a critical condition as result of this incident.

"Although we have arrested a man, our investigation is very much still ongoing and we would like to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time and might have seen this white Vauxhall Corsa - which has very distinctive black wheels.

"If you witnessed this collision or have any dash cam footage of this car leading up to, during, or following this incident, please do not hesitate to get in touch with police as a matter of urgency."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 4741 quoting 479 of 20/09/20 or the independent charity - Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
