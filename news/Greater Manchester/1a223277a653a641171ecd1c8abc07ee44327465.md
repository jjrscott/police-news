Despite Greater Manchester reporting growing numbers of COVID cases, Greater Manchester Police recorded 320 illegal gatherings over the weekend and officers issued 24 Fixed Penalty Notices (FPN). Incidents which resulted in FPNs include the third illegal gathering at a property in North Manchester, an illegal gathering of more than 40 people at a property in Stockport, and an illegal gathering of 60-70 people in Tameside. Officers also issued a closure notice at a property in Trafford after receiving multiple reports of an illegal gathering and associated antisocial behaviour.

This is in advance of the new national restrictions for England to reduce the spread of Covid-19 which came into place this week. People across England must no longer meet people from other households, socially, in groups of more than six. This applies indoors and outdoors, including in homes and gardens. There are a limited number of exemptions.

The new national restrictions, however, do not supersede the varying local restrictions in place in all Greater Manchester boroughs (except Stockport and Wigan). Bolton now has the highest case rate in the country and in response to this, the Government also announced new local restrictions for Bolton which can be found on the Government's website. GMP are urging the people of Greater Manchester to abide by these restrictions in order to prevent the stop of the virus, and report any breaches by using the online reporting tool here: https://www.gmp.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/c19/tell-us-about-possible-breach-coronavirus-measures/

GMP Assistant Chief Constable, Nick Bailey said: "Though Greater Manchester has been subject to local restrictions since the end of July, we understand that the news of additional national restrictions for England and additional local restrictions for Bolton is disappointing.

"Greater Manchester is in a unique position and we are aware of the difficulties that restrictions can cause. That being said, restrictions are necessary to fight Covid-19 and we all have a personal responsibility to comply to protect ourselves and our loved ones from the deadly virus.
 _
_"The demand on GMP has now returned to the pre-Covid level. As a result, it is essential that people comply with the restrictions to reduce the number of breaches which officers have to respond to. If you believe someone is breaching the regulations, and it is not an emergency, please report this via our website. Officers will assess the scale of the breach before attending.

"Throughout the pandemic, GMP has been policing by consent. Officers will continue to prioritise engaging with people, explaining the restrictions and encouraging compliance going forwards. However, people across Greater Manchester should be aware that, when necessary, officers will take enforcement action.

"If you are unsure of what you can and cannot do, it is essential you read the relevant guidance on the Government's website."
