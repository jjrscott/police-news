At around 5.30pm on Monday 2 November 2020, police were called to reports of a robbery at a residential property on Sale Road, Northern Moor.

An investigation was launched and officers established that, at around 5pm, three men had entered the property and confronted a female occupant in front of her two young children - demanding jewellery. One of the men held one of the children at knife point, whilst the other child watched. The men left with jewellery and cash.

Police believe the men arrived and left in a white Volkswagen Polo, with tinted rear windows.

DC Nick Parkin, of GMP's City of Manchester district, said: "This was a particularly nasty incident and it is extremely lucky that no one was seriously injured. The family are still incredibly shaken-up.

"Enquiries are ongoing to identify those responsible. Unfortunately, those responsible have not yet been identified so we are appealing for the public's help - Did you see or hear anything suspicious this time last week? Have you got any information which might help us?

"I would like to reassure the family and community that our investigation in to this incident is very much ongoing and we are committed to ensuring those responsible face the consequences of their actions.

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 4973 quoting 2247 of 02/11/20 or the independent charity - Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
