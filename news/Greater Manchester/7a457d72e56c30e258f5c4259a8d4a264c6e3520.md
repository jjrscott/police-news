Police are appealing to the public for information after a collision in the Bramhall area of Stockport yesterday left a pedestrian with a fractured skull.

Officers were called at around 4.25pm on Monday 21 December to reports of a collision involving a black Nissan Micra and a pedestrian on Bramhall Lane South.

The pedestrian - a 55-year-old woman - suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital, where she remains in a serious but stable condition.

The driver of the Nissan is assisting police with their enquiries.

No arrests have been made and investigators are appealing to the public for any eyewitnesses or anyone with dash cam footage around the area yesterday afternoon to come forward.

Police Constable Steve Johnson, of GMP's Road Policing Unit, said: "We're appealing for information after this awful incident where a woman is in hospital with serious head injuries, which thankfully aren't believed to be life-threatening - our thoughts are with her and her loved ones as she battles to make a recovery.

"It is important we are able to establish all the facts around this collision and I therefore am asking anyone with details about this incident to contact us - the smallest information could ultimately prove vital."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 8809 quoting incident number 1748 of 21/12/2020. Details can be passed anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
