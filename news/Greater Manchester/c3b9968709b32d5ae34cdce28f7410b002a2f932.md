At around 9.45pm on Saturday 24 October 2020, police were called to reports of a collision on the M56 near to Junction 3 Eastbound.

A 26-year old man who was driving a blue Renault Clio was sadly pronounced dead after colliding with a Highways Maintenance lorry which was stationary on the hard shoulder.

A 57-year-old man and 35-year-old man were taken to hospital with minor injuries. Both men have since been discharged.

No arrests have been made and enquiries remain ongoing.

Detective Constable Emma Kennedy, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "This is a devastating incident and our thoughts remain with the man's family at this very difficult time.

"Our officers are working hard to find out exactly what happened in the lead up to this collision and we are appealing for anyone who may have information to come forward and speak to us.

"This is a busy motorway and we believe that there are a number of witnesses who may have dash cam footage or information that can assist us with our enquiries."

Anyone with information should contact the Serious Collison Investigation Unit on 0161 856 4741 quoting incident number 2801 of 24/10/2020.

Reports can also be made anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
