At around 3:20pm on Wednesday 23 September 2020, a 10-year-old girl was approached by a man who was driving a white van on Broadford Road, in Bolton. The man attempted to persuade the girl to go with him.

The next day, at around 3:30pm, a second child - aged 9 - was also approached on Armadale Road, a continuation of Broadford Road, by a man in a white van who attempted to persuade her to go with him.

Both girls ran away and raised the alarm.

The man has been described as Asian and has a bald head and facial hair. At the time of both of the incidents he is described as wearing a high-vis jacket and black trousers.

Detective Sergeant Robert Parker, of GMP's Bolton division, said: "These are two incredibly concerning incidents, and thankfully, in both cases, neither of the children were persuaded to go with this man.

"I would like to reassure the community that we are doing everything we can to find this man and have increased patrols in the area whilst we investigate these incidents. If you have any concerns at all please do speak to our officers.

"We are keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed either of these incidents or seen a man who fits this description driving a white van in the area. If you have seen anything suspicious at all, please do not hesitate to get in touch with police as a matter of urgency."

Anyone with any information can contact police on 01618565757, quoting incident number 740 of 24/09/2020.

Reports can also be made anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
