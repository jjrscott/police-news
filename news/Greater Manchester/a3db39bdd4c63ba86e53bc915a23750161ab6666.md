At around 8pm on Friday 29 November 2019, police were called to reports that a car had collided with a pedestrian on Boundary Street, Rochdale.

The pedestrian - a 25-year-old man - suffered a serious head injury. He was taken to hospital where he remains in a life-threatening condition.

The car - which was originally believed to be a Mercedes C Class - is now believed to be a black Volkswagen Golf that was travelling towards Tweedale Street and failed to stop at the scene.

A 23-year-old man from Rochdale, has been arrested today (Saturday 30 November 2019) on suspicion of serious injury by dangerous driving and failure to stop following a collision.

Sergeant Brian Orr, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "A man has been left fighting for his life as a result of this collision and our thoughts remain with him and his family as he receives treatment.

"I am particularly interested in speaking with anyone that saw a black Golf in the area last night or anyone with dash-cam footage. I would urge anyone with any information that could assist our enquiries to get in touch."

Anyone with information should call GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 0161 856 4741 or 101 quoting incident number 2790 of 29/11/2019, or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
