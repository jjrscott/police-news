On Tuesday 23 June 2020, police investigating the illegal rave in Carrington on Saturday 13 June arrested a 27-year-old man on suspicion of conspiracy to cause public nuisance and criminal damage. He has since been released on bail pending further enquiries.

This arrest comes following intelligence gathered by GMP's dedicated policing operation.

Enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Inspector Julian Scarsbrook, of GMP's Criminal Investigations Department, said: "Since last weekend's raves at Carrington and Daisy Nook in Oldham, we have established a dedicated policing operation and are working alongside our partners to gather intelligence and protect our communities - this operation remains ongoing.

"We have now arrested two individuals in connection with this illegal rave in Carrington, and we remain committed to investigating all lines of enquiry available to us as we identify and pursue anyone involved in the organisation of illegal raves.

"I would like to continue appealing to the public for their support, and ask that anyone who has any intelligence about the raves last weekend or any planned for the future please contact police as soon as possible via our website or 101."
