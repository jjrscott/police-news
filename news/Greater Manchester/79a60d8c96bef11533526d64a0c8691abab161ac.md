Appeal

Officers were called at around 12.15am on Thursday 10 September 2020 to a report of gunshots fired at a property on Fotherby Drive, Blackley.

Officers attended and initial enquiries established that a firearm discharge took place and damage was caused to the property.

No injuries have been reported and there is not believed to be any wider risk to the public.

Enquiries are ongoing and a scene remains in place.

Detective Inspector Claire Moss of GMP's City of Manchester Division, said: "Thankfully, those inside the property were left uninjured but I want to take this opportunity to appeal to anyone with any information or who may have been in the area at the time to come forward and assist us in our enquiries.

"We are particularly keen to speak to anyone who may have seen or have dash-cam footage of anyone acting suspiciously in the area at the time or may have seen a dark coloured vehicle, driving along French Barn Lane in the direction of Plant Hill Road.

"Whilst this incident may cause concern within the community, I would like to take this opportunity to stress that we believe there to be no wider threat to the public and we are doing the upmost to locate those responsible."
