Christmas is around the corner and although things may look a lot different this year, GMP is still committed to keeping Greater Manchester safe, by showing residents how they can keep their homes secure and keep the burglars out in the frost.

As part of Operation Dasher, the force has collated the top home security tips within a series of short videos which they will be sharing on social media throughout the festive season. The videos see Dasher the Reindeer giving local residents prevention advice, such as:

 * Don't 'present' your gifts to burglars - keeping presents out of sight and not keeping gifts under the Christmas tree
 * Make Christmas merry and light - deterring burglars by making your home look occupied using light timers
 * Be 'carol'ful with your locks and keys - making sure to keep windows and doors locked if you go out
 * Don't give burglars the i'deer' that you're not home - not posting on social media that you're out of the house

Assistant Chief Constable Nick Bailey, said: "No one wants to be a victim of burglary, particularly over the festive period. Despite the additional pressures from Covid, Greater Manchester Police are committed to continue operations to target those who commit crimes against our communities, but we also want to ensure that residents of Greater Manchester know the measures they can take to help us keep their homes safe.

"We will be issuing four prevention videos throughout December and although, the videos are light-hearted and fun, they do have a serious message and I would encourage everyone to follow our advice."
