Police are appealing for information following a collision in Altrincham.

Shortly after 9pm on Tuesday 17 December 2019 a silver Ford Fiesta was travelling west along Sinderland Lane.

The vehicle left the road while negotiating a bend, crossed the opposing lane and collided with a tree.

A male passenger in the vehicle aged 18 was taken to hospital with serious injuries that are not believed to be life-threatening.

A further two male passengers aged 18 and 19 and the man driving the car aged 18, attended hospital with minor injuries and have since been released.

The driver has been arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and remains in police custody.

Constable John Durham of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit said: "Thankfully the occupant of the vehicle who remains in hospital is responding well to treatment and we wish him well with his recovery.

"Officers are piecing together the details of what happened in the moments before the collision took place.

"Were you in the area at the time or do you have information or dash-cam footage that may assist our enquiries?

"If so, please get in touch as soon as possible."

Information can be left with police by calling 0161 856 4741. Alternatively, call the independent charity, Crimestoppers, on 0800 555 111.
