Police are appealing for information after an assault in Didsbury.

Officers have released images of two men they want to speak to following an assault on Wilmslow Road on Saturday 29 June 2019 .

At around 11.40pm two men attacked a 24-year-old man outside the Famous Crown pub on Wilmslow Road.

The victim was taken to hospital after suffering serious injuries, including bruises and cuts to his head and chest and a small bleed on the brain. He has since been discharged.

Detective Constable Dean Mulvey of the City of Manchester district said: "This was a vicious attack by two men that left a man in hospital with serious injuries.

"We are appealing to members of the public to assist us in identifying the men in these images we have released as we want to speak to them in connection with the incident.

"The assault took place outside the Famous Crown on _Wilmslow_ Road in the centre of Didsbury village so I would urge anyone who was in this area on Saturday 29 June at the time of the incident and saw anything unusual or suspicious - no matter how insignificant it may seem - to please get in touch with police."
