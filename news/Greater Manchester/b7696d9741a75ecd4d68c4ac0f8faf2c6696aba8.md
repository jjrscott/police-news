Shortly after 3.45am on Wednesday 31 March, police observed a suspicious vehicle close to Mauldeth Road West, Manchester.

A pursuit began after the vehicle failed to stop for an officer and, a short time later, the vehicle collided with a taxi.

A teenage boy, aged 17, is currently in a critical and life-threatening condition in hospital.

A second teenage boy, aged 18, is in a critical but non-life threatening condition.

The driver of the taxi received minor injuries and passenger in the taxi also received serious, but non-life threatening injuries.

All casualties were taken to hospital for treatment.

An officer also got glass in his eye during the subsequent rescue with emergency services. He remains in a stable condition.

The driver of the vehicle, a green Ford Focus, made off from the scene on foot and his whereabouts remain unknown.

No arrests have been made.

As is standard procedure, GMP referred the matter to the IOPC and an investigation is underway.

GMP's Chief Superintendent Wasim Chaudhry said: "Our thoughts are with those affected. We will not be commenting any further and will be fully cooperating with the independent investigation by the IOPC."
