Shortly after 3.30pm today, Wednesday 20 November 2019, police were called to reports that a black Ford Ranger had collided with a pedestrian on East Lancashire Road at the junction with Newearth Road.

The pedestrian, a 70-year-old man, sadly died at the scene despite the best efforts of paramedics.

A 28-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He remains in custody for questioning.

Road closures will remain in place throughout the evening and diversions are in place.

Police Constable Darren White of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "A man has tragically lost his life as a result of this collision and we're doing all we can to support his family at this devastating time.

"The road closures will remain in place whilst specialist officers carry out enquiries at the scene so we would advise people to avoid the area where possible.

"Whilst we have a man in custody, the collision happened at a relatively busy time of day and I'd encourage anyone with any information or dash-cam footage to get in touch as soon as possible so we can piece together the circumstances that led to this tragic incident."

Anyone with information should call GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 0161 856 4741 or 101 quoting incident number 1563 of 20/11/2019, or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
