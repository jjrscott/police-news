At around 7.30am on Thursday 8 October 2020, police received a report that several graves had been damaged in the grounds of St Peter's, Church Road.

An investigation was launched. Whilst investigators completed house-to-house enquiries and CCTV trawls, extra officers were deployed to patrol the area.

At 12.35pm on Thursday 15 October 2020, police, sadly, received a report that further graves had been damaged since Tuesday (13 October 2020).

Enquiries are ongoing.

Inspector David Johnston, of GMP's Bolton district, said: "I would like to start by sending my condolences to the families and friends affected by these callous crimes. The person/ people responsible clearly have no regard for others - I would encourage them to think about how they would feel if the grave belonged to one of their loved ones. I am disgusted by what has happened.

"An investigation is underway and I can reassure people that my team will work hard to identify the offenders and ensure they face justice. Finally, I would appeal to anyone with information which may assist us with this to contact us or Crimestoppers as soon as possible so that we can prevent any further incidents."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 5599 quoting 645 of 08/10/20 or 1151 of 15/10/20. Alternatively, the independent charity - Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
