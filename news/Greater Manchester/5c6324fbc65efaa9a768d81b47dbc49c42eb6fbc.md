Officers have released CCTV footage of two men they want to speak to after an elderly man's car was damaged in Stockport.

At around 11.50pm on Tuesday 14 July 2020, officers were called to a report of criminal damage after the windscreen of a Citroen C1 parked on Woodhall Crescent, Reddish was smashed.

Enquiries are ongoing to identify those responsible and anyone with information is asked to get in touch.

PC Matthew Delaney, from GMP's Stockport district, said: "The owner of this car is elderly and vulnerable and has now been left with limited transport as a result.

"It's believed that this was a targeted attack following on-going anti-social behaviour issues in the area. We began investigating following the first report of the offence but we are now appealing to the public some time on as other enquiries have been unsuccessful.

"We're seeking to identify the two people in the CCTV. Anyone who recognises those involved should email heatonsandreddish@gmp.police.uk quoting incident number 592 of 15/07/2020.

"Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
