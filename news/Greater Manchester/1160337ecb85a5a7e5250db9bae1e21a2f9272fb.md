An investigation has been launched after a stagecoach double decker bus was set alight in Dukinfield.

At around 11.45pm on Thursday 8 August 2019, a man started a fire on the upstairs of the number 330 Stagecoach bus before leaving the vehicle.

The bus had left Hyde Bus station a short time earlier with a few passengers on board and was travelling through Dukinfield.

The driver pulled over and the bus was evacuated. The fire service attended and extinguished the blaze but significant damage was caused to the vehicle.

The suspect is described as a white man in his late teens to early 20s, wearing a green camouflage jacket, dark coloured jogging pants and a black headband across his forehead. He was also carrying a black Vans rucksack.

Officers are treating this as arson and are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen anything around the time of the fire.

Detective Constable Stephanie Ann Jones of GMP's Tameside District said: "Thankfully no one was injured in this incident, but they could easily have been.

"We are treating this incident with the utmost seriousness and are appealing for anyone who witnessed anything suspicious in the area to get in touch as soon as possible."

Details can be reported to police on 0161 856 9216 / 69262 quoting incident number 3642 of 08/08/19.

Information can also be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
