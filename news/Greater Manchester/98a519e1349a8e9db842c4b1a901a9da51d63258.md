Officers are appealing for witnesses after an elderly man died following a collision in Hyde.

Shortly after 10.20pm on Friday 16 October 2020, police were called to reports that an Orange Ford Transit van had collided with a pedestrian at the entrance to the carpark of The Harehill Tavern pub on Underwood Road, Hyde.

The 77-year-old pedestrian was taken to hospital with serious head injuries but sadly, despite the best efforts of medical staff, he passed away on Saturday (17 October 2020).

A 28-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of drug driving and causing death by driving without due care and attention. He has since been released under investigation.

Enquiries are ongoing.

Police Constable Andrew Sheldrick, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "Our thoughts are very much with this man's family as they try and come to terms with what happened and it's very important that we establish what led to this incident.

"A man has been released under investigation after being questioned by officers today but enquiries are very much ongoing.

"If you witnessed this collision of have any CCTV or dash-cam footage, please get in touch as soon as possible. Even the smallest piece of information could really help us piece together the circumstances surrounding this incident."

Anyone with information should call GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 0161 856 4741 quoting incident number 3174 of 16/10/20, or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
