An investigation has been launched after a family home was set alight in Crumpsall, Manchester on two separate occasions.

At around 11pm on Monday 21 December 2020, a male has attended an address on Saddlecote Close and poured an accelerant over the front door before setting it alight.

The same person has then attended the same address on Thursday 24 December 2020 at approximately 10.30pm and again set the front of the premises on fire.

Police have issued CCTV images of a man they would like to speak to in connection with the fires.

Detective Constable Marcus Pugh of GMP's City of Manchester division, said: "Thankfully no one has been reported injured following these inexcusable and dangerous attacks but the outcome could have been a completely different story.

"We're treating this as arson and are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen anything around the time of the fire or witnessed anyone behaving suspiciously around the time of either incident."

Details can be reported to police by calling 0161 856 1146 quoting incident number 2987 of 21/12/2020.

Information can also be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
