Vehicles recovered and three arrested after officers conduct a warrant in Bolton.

Early this morning (Wednesday 17 March 2021), a team of officers from GMP's Bolton district alongside specialist officers from GMP's Tactical Aid Unit carried out a warrant on Hall Lane in Farnworth.

Three vehicles have been recovered by police - a Volvo, a Vauxhall and a Ford transit van.

One man - aged 23 - and two boys - both aged 16 - were arrested on suspicion of theft and burglary. They remain in custody for questioning.

Inspector Duncan Haynes, of GMP's Bolton district said: "I cannot stress the importance of the public's help in our fight against crime. Today's excellent results were made possible because of valuable information which was reported by a vigilant member of the public.

"Following this information our dedicated team of officers conducted a thorough investigation which has resulted in these three arrests and the recovery of three vehicles.

"We would always encourage anyone with information, no matter how insignificant you may feel it is, to contact police as soon as possible. The intelligence we receive can prove invaluable in helping GMP to protect our communities and keep our streets safe from crime.

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 or alternatively, details can be passed on anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
