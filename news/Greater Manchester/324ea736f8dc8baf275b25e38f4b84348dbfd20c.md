Shortly before 9.30pm on Tuesday 12 November 2019, police were called to reports of a collision on the junction of Brinksway and Alder Grove.

Enquiries by GMP's Serious Investigation Unit have since established that a Honda motorcycle travelling along Brinksway collided with a red B-Max Ford car as the car was turning right into Alder Grove.

The driver of the motorbike - a 23-year-old man- was taken to hospital with head and neck injuries, but despite best efforts from medical staff, he sadly died a short while later.

PC Andrew Nicholson, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "This was a tragic accident where a man has sadly lost his life. Specialist officers are with his family and supporting them through this horrific time.

"If you were in the area at this time and saw the collision or have any dash cam footage that could assist our enquiries then please get in touch."
