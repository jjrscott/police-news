Shortly before 10.10pm on Saturday 25 April 2020, police were called to reports of an armed burglary at a property on Mottram Rise, off Mottram Road.

Three men armed with knives and sledgehammers forced entry to the property by smashing through a glass door before threatening the 26-year-old homeowner.

They demanded cash and other items and fled with a quantity of cash and two Rolex Watches. They also caused a significant amount of damage to the property.

Following a warrant executed in Middleton yesterday, a 28-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of robbery and a 25-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit robbery. Both have been bailed pending further enquiries.

Detective Inspector Zoe MacDonald, of GMP's Tameside District, said: "We have been following several lines of enquiry since this atrocious incident on Saturday night and whilst we have made two arrests, our investigation is very much ongoing.

"Thankfully the woman wasn't injured but she was left incredibly upset by the incident and officers are continuing to support her.

"We're continuing to appeal for information and I'd ask anyone who knows anything that could assist our enquiries to please get in touch."

Anyone with information should call police on 0161 856 9262 or 101 quoting incident number 3238 of 25/04/2020. Reports can also be made via the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
