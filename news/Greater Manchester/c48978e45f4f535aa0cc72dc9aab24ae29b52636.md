Detectives have released CCTV images of two men they would like to speak to following a robbery in Oldham.

At around 5.45pm on Monday 21 September 2020, officers were called to a report of a robbery at News Food and Booze off-licence on Beal Lane, Shaw.

Two men, armed with a machete and a knife, threatened a shop owner in his 40s and stole a large quantity of cigarettes and cash.

They made off on foot in the direction of Mark Lane.

The offenders are both described as white. One of the men was approximately 6ft tall, slim build and was wearing a light coloured Armani hoodie, dark jogging bottoms, dark coloured gloves and dark coloured trainers.

The other offender was just under 6ft tall, slim build and was wearing a dark coloured Nike hoodie with a red top on underneath, light blue coloured Nike jogging bottoms and dark coloured trainers.

Detective Constable Craig Bowring, of Oldham's CID, said: "This robbery left the shop owner extremely shaken up and we're keen to bring those responsible to justice.

"The incident took place at a business situated on a busy road and cars may have driven past and saw the two men. Though you can't see their faces in the footage - someone may recognise their clothing.

"Anyone with information or anyone who may recognise the men pictured in the CCTV is asked to call 0161 856 8891 quoting log 2239 of 21/09/20.

"Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
