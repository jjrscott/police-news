Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a man was left in a critical condition following a stabbing in Harpurhey earlier today (29 September 2020).

Officers were called to a report of a stabbing on Church Lane at around 2.40pm where a man was found with serious injuries.

Emergency services attended and a man in his 30s was taken to hospital by ambulance where he remains in critical condition.

Enquiries so far have established that a group of individuals had been involved in an altercation.

Just after 3pm, officers received a report from a hospital to say a second man in his 30s had self-presented with knife wounds where he also remains in serious condition. Officers are currently treating the two incidents as linked.

A scene remains in place on Church Lane while investigations continue.

Detective Inspector Tony Platten, of GMP's City of Manchester division, said: "One man is currently in critical condition in hospital and our detectives are currently working to establish the circumstances of what happened.

"Residents nearby will see an increased police presence in the area whilst enquiries are carried out. Anyone with concerns can speak to our officers.

"This kind of violent behaviour will not be tolerated and we're asking anyone with information to come forward to so we can find those responsible.

"Anyone who may have seen anything or may have any information that will assist us with our investigation can call 0161 8561146 quoting incident number 1659 of 29/09/20.
