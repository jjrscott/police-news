The first step of the roadmap out of lockdown started yesterday, Monday 8 March. Included in this step was the requirement for all passengers travelling internationally to carry a new form that shows their trip is lawfully permitted under the current national restrictions.

Please make sure you have downloaded and completed the form before you travel. The forms will be checked before you are able to board, either at check-in or the departure gate.

Officers will also be conducting spot checks and have the power to ask all travellers to produce the completed form. If the completed form is not produced you may face a Â£200 fine and could also be refused entry on to your flight.

The stay-at-home rules remain in place and it is illegal to travel abroad without a permitted reason to do so.
