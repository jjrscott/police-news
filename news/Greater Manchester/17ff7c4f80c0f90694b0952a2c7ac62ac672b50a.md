This is a difficult period and one that everyone has to adapt to and make huge changes to ensure we limit the spread of this virus. I wanted to thank you all for your continued support of the ongoing changes we as a force are experiencing and we are extremely grateful to the increasing number of people who are using the Live Chat and online crime recording facilities through our website instead of calling when reporting non-emergency incidents.
