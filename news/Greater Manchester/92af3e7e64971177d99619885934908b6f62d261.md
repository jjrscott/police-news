Ella-Rose Tribute

Ella-Rose's mum, Pagan Clover, said: "There is no way to describe how it felt losing Ella, The pain is physical; it feels like nothing I have ever experienced.

"Ella's death hasn't just affected me; it had had an indescribable impact on my entire family and network of friends.

"Ella was a little monkey, she was infectious and everybody loved her, now everybody's heart is in pieces.

"My son Harry will never get the chance to meet his big sister. Freyah will never see her sister, her best friend again. My family and I will suffer for the rest of our lives.

"Ella showed nothing but love for Sharleen and Mick, they were a massive part of our daily lives and always came across as loving and caring towards me and my girls. Then they both breached our trust and Ella's in the worst way possible. Never would I have believed that either of them could ever hurt our baby.

"Ella was loved beyond words and there will always be a hole in my heart that only Ella can fill. There are no words to describe the feeling of pain and loss.

"No level of punishment will ever be enough but maybe knowing that Mick Wild can never harm another child will go some way to helping us all heal one day. "
