A man burgled the property on Bell Clough Road at around 9.30pm on Friday 10 April 2020.

The offender stole a number of items including cash, bank cards, a mobile phone and iPads.

He is believed to have been wearing dark clothing and a balaclava.

A vulnerable adult - a man in his 50s - was inside at the time of the incident, but thankfully wasn't injured.

Detective Inspector Dave Donlan, of GMP's Tameside district, said: "This is a shocking incident, in which a vulnerable adult has been burgled at time where we should be coming together and helping each other.

"It's extremely saddening to be investigating crimes like this, but I want to make it clear that we will do everything we can to bring those responsible to justice.

"I am making a direct appeal to anyone who may have information to please get in touch; did you see anything suspicious around the time of the incident?

"With more people indoors at the moment, I am hopeful that someone, somewhere, may have seen something that can assist our enquiries."

Information can be given to police by calling 0161 856 2962 quoting incident number 3340 of 10/4/2020. Details can also be anonymously passed to the independent charity, Crimestoppers, on 0800 555 111.
