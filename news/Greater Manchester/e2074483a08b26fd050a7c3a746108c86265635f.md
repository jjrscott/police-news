Shortly before 12:45am on Tuesday 5 May 2020, officers stopped a Seat Ibiza on Broad Street in Salford.

After conducting a search of the car, officers discovered a large quantity of cash.

Following this discovery, officers made the decision to conduct a more thorough search and seized a quantity of cocaine.

Two men - aged 29 and 26 - have been arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs and for breach of COVID-19 legislation.

The 26-year-old man has further been arrested on suspicion of driving whilst disqualified, taking a vehicle without consent and obstructing police.

Both men have been released under investigation.

Inspector Michael Parker, of GMP's Salford division, said: "This stop and search was conducted by two of our student officers.

"These students are a credit to our programme, showing great initiative and proactivity which has resulted in two men being arrested and a quantity of drugs and cash being swiftly seized.

"Drugs have a hugely detrimental impact on our society and stopping them from entering our streets is a great step towards tackling drug crime in our community, which remains a great priority for GMP."
