At around 10pm on Friday 18 September 2020, police were called to reports of a robbery at a residential property on Teesdale Close.

Officers attended and established that three men had entered the property and demanded money and vehicles. A man in his 40s was assaulted. The offenders fled in the victims' cars - a Black Vauxhall Mokka (DP14 DVG) and a blue BMW (G14NLY).

No one required hospital treatment.

An investigation is underway.

No arrests have been made.

The offenders are described as being slim to medium build. At the time of the incident, they were all wearing black clothing.

DC Mike Winnard, of GMP's Wigan District, said: "This was a terrifying experience for the victims - people should feel safe in their own homes.

"No one was injured but this incident could have had more serious consequences, especially as the offenders tried to squirt a substance in the victims' faces.

"I am appealing to anyone with information to contact us or Crimestoppers as soon as possible so we can identify those responsible and ensure they face justice."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 7770 quoting 3211 of 18/09/20 or the independent charity - Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
