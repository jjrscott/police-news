Police want to speak to the three men in new CCTV footage

Officers were called shortly before 8.15pm on Saturday 11 January 2020 to reports of a robbery at a store on the junction of Moss Road and Davyhulme Road.

Two men entered the shop - both wielding a knife - and demanded a member of staff opened the till.

The men then proceeded to take cash and several items from the shop shelves. A third man then joined them before all three fled on foot.

Police have released images of three men officers wan to speak to in relation to the incident.

Detective Constable Laura Floodgate, of GMP's Trafford Division, said: "This was a frightening ordeal for the workers at the store who were left in great shock but thankfully they didn't suffer any injuries.

"The footage we have released today shows two men we want to speak to regarding this and we also believe there was a third man outside the store who we are also keen to make contact with.

"If any members of the public recognise anything familiar regarding these men, or if anyone was close to the scene at the time of the incident and remembers three men acting suspiciously around the area, then we urge them to get in contact with us."

Anyone with any information can call police on 0161 857 6724 quoting crime number CRI/06MM/0000574/20. Details can also be passed anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
