Did you witness a robbery in Moses Gate Country Park, Bolton?

Officers are appealing for information after a man in his 60s was robbed on Sunday 17 May 2020.

At around 5.10pm the man was approached by two other men, who punched him in the head before stealing a black Ellehammer shoulder bag, which contained personal items including bank cards.

The victim sustained facial injuries requiring hospital treatment.

The offenders fled on foot toward the main car park off Hall Lane.

They are described as two Asian males, one of whom was wearing a blue anorak.

Detective Constable David Perry of GMP's Bolton District said: "This was a violent attack on a man who was simply out for a walk and minding his own business.

"Although there are limited descriptions of the offenders, the attack occurred in an area where people are choosing to take their daily exercise during the current circumstances.

"The offenders fled toward the car park, so we believe someone may have seen them afterwards and be able to give us more information, or perhaps their onward direction of travel.

"If you have any details or perhaps dash cam, CCTV or phone footage that can assist us, please get in touch as soon as possible."

Anyone who has any information about the robbery should call police on 0161 856 5757 quoting incident number 1973 of 17/05/2020.

Details can also be passed on anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
