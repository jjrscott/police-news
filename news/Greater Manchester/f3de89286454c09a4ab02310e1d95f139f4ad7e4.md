Officers are investigating after eight cars were stolen from dealerships in Ardwick and Ancoats.

Police investigating the burglaries have released an image of a man they want to speak to in connection with the incidents.

At around 1am on Thursday 27 August 2019 offenders broke into a Nissan dealership on _Chancellor_ Lane **,** _Ardwick_ **.** Five vehicles were stolen and 50 sets of car keys.

Around an hour later at 2am four offenders broke into a dealership office in Ancoats, Manchester. The suspects took 33 sets of keys from the office safe before they drove off with three lavish Mercedes vehicles worth in excess of Â£130,000.

Police are investigating whether the burglaries are linked.

All three Mercedes vehicles have been found by police and will be examined by specialist officers. Police are still searching for the stolen Nissan vehicles.

"If you saw any vehicles or anyone acting suspiciously in Ardwick or Ancoats between 1am - 2am on Thursday 27 August 2019, please get in touch with us as soon as possible"
