Sergeant Marie McNulty and PC Jay McGreavy from our Bury police team should have been tying the knot on Thursday, but instead they spent the day working to help keep our local communities safe.

However, their team at Greater Manchester Police (GMP) couldn't let their day pass by without a little hint of wedding bells!

Sergeant McNulty was welcomed into the office at the start of her shift with 'here comes the bride', and both officers proudly wore their corsages for their shifts. Colleagues of the officers had also organised flowers and champagne to help brighten the day for the couple.

On top of this, Inspector Rob Findlow who is an ordained Anglican Priest, blessed the couple's rings in a private little ceremony.

Sergeant McNulty said: "I would like to thank my team for all that they did for us, we are so grateful and had a lovely day. The little touches were really appreciated, and team really did make it a day to remember, in our own way.

"We have rescheduled our day for April next year, so we have started our countdown again and are looking forward to the double celebrations when the time is right. For now, we are grateful for the celebrations we have had, and are glad we can play our part in helping support our local communities during these uncertain times."
