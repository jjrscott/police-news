"Our Joe's life was taken for no reason whatsoever. A life with so much left to do and cherished by so many.

"When a life sentence is given in court, I never knew that it was about the victim and their family and friends.

"Every day, every week, and every year, Joe is and will be on our minds. He is missed so much by so many.

"Joe was kind, funny, laid-back and loved his music. He loved his nephews and niece; losing him will affect their lives forever.

"Joe was one of the good guys; he carried a comb, not a knife.

"Words don't describe what Joe's death has done to his friends; all decent young lads who are traumatised for the rest of their lives.

"If a life sentence meant life for the perpetrators and a 10 year minimum sentence for carrying a knife, maybe no one else would have to suffer and the trend would end.

"R.I.P my gorgeous son and best bud."

Earlier today, Tuesday 19 November 2019, Momodou Jallow (17/03/98) of Ashley Lane, Moston has been sentenced to life and will serve a minimum of 22 years in prison after fatally stabbing Joe O'Brien during a large fight on Oldham Road in the early hours of Sunday 21 April 2019.

Daniel Kamara (30/01/97), of Beswick Drive, Failsworth also stood trial in relation to the incident and was found guilty of the manslaughter of Joe O'Brien and a section 20 assault of a 21-year-old man and has received an 11 year sentence, at least half of which will be served in custody.
