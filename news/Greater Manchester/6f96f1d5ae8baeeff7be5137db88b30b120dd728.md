Thomas McCann (24/06/71), of Rosslave Walk, Brinnington, has been charged with murder.
_
_ He has been remanded in custody and will appear at Manchester and Salford Magistrates Court on Saturday 30 May 2020.

At around 10.30am on Monday 25 May 2020, police were called to reports that a member of the public had found human remains in Reddish Vale Country Park.

Enquiries have led officers to believe that the remains belong to a woman in her 40s. Her next of kin have been informed but formal identification has not yet taken place.
