Police are appealing for witnesses after a man was shot in Wigan.

At around 4.20pm today (Thursday 19 September 2019), police received a report that a man had been shot on Bickershaw Lane.

Emergency services responded and the victim, a man in his 50s, was taken to hospital with a gunshot wound. His condition is not believed to be life-threatening.

Initial enquiries have established that a black Audi was seen in the area a short time before the victim was shot.

Inspector Mark Ainscough, of GMP's Wigan district, said: "The man's injuries are serious, and now that he is receiving medical treatment, our priority is to find those responsible for this shooting.

"I can appreciate that incidents such as this will cause a lot of concern in the community but I would like to reassure the public that we have launched a full investigation into what happened.

"A scene will remain in place as our officers continue their enquiries.

"I am appealing for the public's help to gather more information and need people who saw what happened to come forward."

Anybody with information should contact police on 0161 856 7957, quoting log 1931 of 19/09/2019 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
