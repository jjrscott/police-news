Last night officers arrested six people and recovered a handgun and ammunition in north Manchester in relation to an ongoing operation into the supply of firearms.

The four men and two women are aged between 25 and 29 - were arrested during warrants in the Crumpsall area yesterday (Thursday 10 December 2020) evening.

They were held on suspicion of drugs and firearms offences.

Following the arrests, premises on Sherbourne Street, Cheetham Hill, were searched and officers recovered a semi-automatic handgun and 10 bullets - all have been seized and taken for forensic examination.

The arrests are part of Operation Malaga - a dedicated investigation into the supply of firearms and drugs in Greater Manchester.

Enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Superintendent Danny Inglis, of GMP's Serious and Organised Crime Group, said: "Last night's action saw further significant work done to tackle the supply of firearms in our region and we have been able to recover some significant evidence as we continue our enquiries into this operation.

"This operation concerns the supply of weapons not just in Manchester but across the region and we are determined to continue to send a strong message to those involved in this incredibly dangerous and damaging trade that we will continue to pursue you and bring you to justice."
