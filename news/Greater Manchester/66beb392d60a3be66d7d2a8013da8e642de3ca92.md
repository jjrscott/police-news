A fifth teenager has been arrested in relation to the death of Mohammed Islam, who was hit by his own car in Stockport in January.

An 18-year-old man was arrested in Hyde earlier today (Tuesday 2 March) on suspicion of conspiracy to steal and remains in custody for questioning.

Previously two 18-year-old boys were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to steal and have since been released on bail.

A 14-year-old boy has already been charged with Mohammed's murder and is next due to appear at Manchester Crown Court (Crown Square) on Monday 5 July 2021.

A second 14-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion with murder and has since been bailed with conditions.

Just after 9pm on Friday 8 January 2021, 53-year-old Mohammed Islam was struck by his own car following a robbery in the Romiley area.

Mohammed was taken to hospital where he sadly died on Sunday 10 January.
