Over 150 bags of suspected class A drugs have been seized by officers after an address was searched today (20 August 2020).

Following intelligence, a warrant was executed at an address in Lenham Towers in Brinnington at around 7.30am.

Over 150 bags of what is believed to be cocaine and heroin were uncovered and seized by officers.

A 35-year-old man and two women aged 34 and 26 have been arrested on suspicion of possession of controlled drugs with intent to supply. They remain in custody at this time and enquiries are on-going.

PC Joel Murphy, of GMP Stockport district, said: "I hope these arrests will reassure residents in Stockport that we are fully committed to making their area a safer place by continuing to target the supply of suspected illegal drugs across Greater Manchester.

"Listening to residents and receiving information is key in helping us to reduce crime and drug supply. Anyone with any information should contact us by reporting online at https://www.gmp.police.uk/.

"Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
