A man has been jailed in connection with a fatal collision in Leigh.

At around 11pm on Saturday 22 August 2020, a Mercedes A200 collided with trees after travelling straight over the roundabout at the junction of the East Lancs Road and Warrington Road - commonly known as the Greyhound Roundabout.

A passenger in the car, a man in his 30s, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

Reece Entwistle (13/11/90) of Deansgate Lane, Timperley was arrested and subsequently charged with causing death by dangerous driving and driving whilst over the prescribed limit for drink/drugs.

After pleading guilty at an earlier hearing, today (Wednesday 4 November 2020), he was sentenced at Bolton Crown Court to seven years and six months.

He was also disqualified from driving for 13 years.

PC Karl Horner, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "Our thoughts remain with the man's loved ones and I hope this sentencing provides them with a sense of closure.

"I also hope this case serves as a reminder about the potential consequences of driving whilst under the influence of alcohol or drugs."
