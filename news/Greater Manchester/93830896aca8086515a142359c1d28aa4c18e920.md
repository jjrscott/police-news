Officers investigating after two men were assaulted in Altrincham, Trafford have released CCTV of a man they want to speak to in connection with the incident.

At around 5.50pm on Saturday 28 November 2020, police were called to reports that a man in his 40's was kicked to floor and attacked with a knife by a second man, resulting in serious injuries requiring hospital treatment.

His neighbour, a man in his 50's was also assaulted by the offender when he tried to intervene and help the victim.

The offender then made off in a silver Mercedes driven by another man.
One man aged 33 years was arrested on suspicion of assault and released under investigation.

Detective Constable David Jarvis of GMP's Trafford district, said: "The victim of this appalling attack has been left with serious injuries and his neighbour, who tried to go the victim's aid has, although fortunately not been left with any lasting physical injuries, has understandably been left distressed.

"The man we would like to speak to enters shot from the right, and I would encourage anyone who may have information about the incident to get in contact."

Anyone with any information about the assault should call 0161 856 7570 quoting log number 2047 of the 28/11/2020.

Information can also be passed anonymously by calling the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
