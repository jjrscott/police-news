At around 12.30am on Thursday 2 January 2020 a 43-year-old man was assaulted by a group of offenders as he delivered a food order to an address in Ancoats.

The suspects kicked and punched the man then hit him over the head with a glass bottle before they took his car keys and fled the scene in his vehicle.

The man was taken to hospital after the incident and suffered cuts to his face and head which were approximately two inches in length and bruising to his shoulder.

No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing.
