Joyce

At around 5.50pm on Saturday 18 April 2020, police were called by the ambulance service responding to a report of an injured man on Hambridge Close, Cheetham Hill.

Officers attended and established that the injured man was friends with Anthony Joyce (08/08/84) of Gorsedale Avenue, Gorton, who had been staying with him. On Friday 17 April 2020, the victim and Joyce drank together and argued about money. During the argument, Joyce left the room and returned with a machete which he used to assault the victim. The following day, a third party visited the victim's home which resulted in the call for paramedics and police.

Joyce was arrested, taken into police custody for questioning and, later, charged.

After pleading guilty at an earlier hearing, today (Thursday 4 February 2021), Joyce was sentenced at Manchester Crown Court to nine years imprisonment for assault.

DC Kate Radford, of GMP's City of Manchester district, said: "The victim sustained serious head, arm and leg injuries. The leg injuries alone required 57 stitches and a brace.

"Despite the severity of his injuries, the victim initially tried to protect his friend by saying he'd been attacked by a group of men.

"I hope this case reassures victims that Greater Manchester Police will support them to tell their side of the story to ensure those responsible for crimes face justice."
