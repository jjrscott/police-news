Paul Rostron

The family of a man who died following a collision in Bolton have paid tribute to him.

At around 6pm on Tuesday 24 November 2020 police were called to reports of a collision on Smithills Dean Road in Bolton.

Enquiries established that a black car collided with a tree before colliding with a stationary white van.

Emergency services attended and the driver of the car - 34-year-old Paul Rostron - was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

Enquiries are ongoing.

Paul's family said: "To say we are devastated as a family is an understatement.

"Our Paul was a much loved son, brother, uncle, cousin and friend to many. A true gentleman in every sense of the word, he had a heart filled with kindness and was the epitome of old school etiquette and chivalry.

"Paul, we will miss you beyond words.

"We would like to thank everyone for their support during this most difficult of times. Our family will now take the time we need to grieve in private."
