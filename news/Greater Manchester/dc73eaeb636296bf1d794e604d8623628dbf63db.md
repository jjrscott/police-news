A man has been charged with conspiracy to commit murder as part of an ongoing investigation into serious and organised crime in Salford.

Jamie Rothwell (8/12/86), previously of the Salford area, has been charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit murder and two counts of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm.

He has been remanded to appear at Manchester and Salford Magistrates court this morning (Wednesday 17 June 2020). He has been further remanded to appear at Manchester Crown Court, Crown Square on Wednesday 15 July 2020.

This follows his arrest in Barcelona in May 2020, which came as a joint operation between Greater Manchester Police and the National Crime Agency.

The charges relate to Greater Manchester Police's ongoing investigation into a dispute between two rival organised crime groups in Salford in 2015. The operation is codenamed Leopard.

In 2015, a man was shot in Salford as he sat in a car with two others. In a separate incident, a second man was seriously attacked with a machete.
