Police investigating the sexual assault of a girl in Bury have released an image of a man they want to speak to about the incident.

The girl, aged 14, was walking along Croft Street, Bury between 12.30pm - 12.45pm on Saturday 22 June 2019, when a man approached her and sexually assaulted her.

The man then ran off in the direction of the Iceland Food store on Rochdale Road.

The girl was uninjured during the attack.

"Since the incident occurred we have followed numerous lines of enquiries to trace the offender. We now turn to the general public to assist our investigation.

"We appreciate that this incident may cause concern among residents in the local community but I want to make it very clear that we are doing all that we can to trace the person responsible."
