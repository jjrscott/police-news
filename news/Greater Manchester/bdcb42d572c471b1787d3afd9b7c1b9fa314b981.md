Officers are appealing for witnesses after two robberies were carried out in the same evening on Ashton Road on Saturday 12 October 2019.

At around 9.30pm a group of approximately six to eight teenage boys approached a 17-year-old boy who was riding his bike along the road.

They proceeded to threaten the boy before assaulting him and stealing his black Carrera hybrid bicycle with blue writing.

Just over an hour later on the same stretch of road a group of boys assaulted an 18-year-old man before taking his Piaggio Typhoon 125 moped.

The first victim suffered minor injuries as a result and the second went to hospital to receive treatment for injuries to his fingers.

The group of teenagers are believed to be between the ages of 15 and 19 and have been described as wearing black jackets and tracksuit bottoms.

One of the offenders, a white man, is described as wearing aviator-type black sunglasses and another man in the group, also white, is said to have had short curly brown hair.

A third teenager has been described as black and around 6ft 2ins tall. He was wearing a black hooded jacket.

Police believe these two incidents are connected and are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with CCTV footage to get in touch.

Anyone who has any information about the robbery should call police on 0161

856 8557 quoting incident number 3510 of 12/10/2019. Details can also be passed to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
