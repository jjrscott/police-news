Marukh Aslam

The family of a woman who died following a collision in Bury have paid tribute to her.

At 1.40am on Wednesday 2 December 2020, police were called to a report of a collision involving one vehicle on Bolton Road West, Holcombe Brook.

Officers attended and established that a black Audi A1 had collided with a wall.

The female passenger - 35-year-old Marukh Aslam - was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

A 44-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, driving whilst unfit through drink or drugs and police assault. She has since been released on bail.

Aslam's family said: A daughter, sister, aunty, mother and a friend to many who was taken too soon.

"She was an extraordinary role model and a remarkable woman with good deeds who conquered the hearts of many.

"Heaven has truly gained an angel, you can now spread your wings, fly high and watch over all your loved ones... Gone but never forgotten, until we meet again beautiful."
