At around 1am today (Friday 10 January 2020), officers were on patrol when they attempted to stop a White Volkswagen Golf on the A6 Manchester Road in Bolton.

The car failed to stop for officers and drove off along Manchester Road towards Chequerbent Roundabout.

The car was temporarily lost by the officers and was found a short time later having collided with railings and a lamp post on the approach to the roundabout.

The sole occupant of the Golf - a man believed to be in his 20's - sadly died at the scene despite the best efforts of emergency services.

The incident has been referred to the Independent Office of Police Conduct by GMP's Professional Standards Branch in line with normal policy.

Inspector Danny Byrne, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "Sadly a man has lost his life as a result of this collision and his family will be supported by specially trained officers.

"The scene will remain in place while the investigation is ongoing which means a number of road closures will be in place throughout the morning so commuters are advised to avoid the area where possible.

"As enquiries progress, I would appeal for any witnesses or anyone with any information that could assist our investigation to please get in touch."

Anyone with information should GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 0161 856 4741 or 101 quoting incident number 122 of 10/01/2020, or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
