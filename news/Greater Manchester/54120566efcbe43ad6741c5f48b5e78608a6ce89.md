We are aware of a number of social media posts circulating which may identify potential victims of sexual offences in connection with the live investigation into Reynhard Sinaga.

We would like to stress that under the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000, victims of sexual offices have a lifelong right to anonymity and therefore any post which identifies victims of sexual offences constitutes a criminal offence. Additionally these posts risk jeopardising an ongoing investigation into serious crime.

Please be mindful when sharing any social media posts.
