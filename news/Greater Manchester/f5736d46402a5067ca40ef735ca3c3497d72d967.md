Police are appealing to the public for further information after a 21-year-old man was stabbed on Gargrave Avenue on Monday 23 March 2020.

Officers were called at around 4.45pm to reports of a man receiving multiple stab wounds after the incident, which involved a group of around seven teenage boys wearing tracksuits.

The 21-year-old remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition.

A 15-year-old boy was arrested a short time later on suspicion of Section 18 assault and has since been released on bail.

Detectives are keen to speak to any witnesses to the incident and urge them to contact police.

Detective Sergeant Craig Wallace, of GMP's Bolton division, said: "This was a brutal attack in broad daylight which has left a man with serious stab wounds and we are now working to establish the full circumstances of this incident.

"Our enquiries so far have established that there were around six or seven boys - aged between 15 and 16 - that were around the scene at the time and we are keen to find out who those boys are and what their role was in this incident.

"We have made one arrest but are continuing to work to ascertain further information. Any members of the public who were around the area - or who may have CCTV or dash cam footage of a group of teenage boys acting suspiciously in the area - I encourage you to contact us."

Anyone with any information regarding this incident should contact Bolton CID on 0161 856 5567 quoting incident number 1805 of 23/03/2020. Details can also be passed anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
