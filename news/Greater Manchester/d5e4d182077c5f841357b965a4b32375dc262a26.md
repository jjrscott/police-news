Police executing a warrant in Manchester City Centre this morning have arrested four men and seized a significant amount of suspected cannabis.

At around 07.30am this morning (Thursday 8 October 2020), a team of officers from GMP's City of Manchester District - alongside partners from Manchester City Council and Greater Manchester Fire & Rescue Service - executed a warrant at an address on Park Place, Strangeways.

The warrant was executed as part of Operation Compartment, set up by GMP officers to tackle the supply of cannabis in the Strangeways area of Manchester.

Four men - aged between 29 and 47 - were arrested on suspicion of cultivating cannabis and being concerned in the supply of controlled substances.

They all remain in custody for questioning.

Inspector Wignall of GMP's City of Manchester District said: "Firstly I'd like to thank all the officers - and the partners who have worked alongside us for successfully bringing this criminal, and brazen, activity to an end.

"We currently have four people in custody and I hope that this serves as a stark reminder that GMP will absolutely not tolerate activity that encourages the purchase and consumption of drugs, particularly during a global pandemic.

"Drugs can blight communities and destroy lives, and the activity we suspect we have uncovered today only serves to fuel that destruction."
