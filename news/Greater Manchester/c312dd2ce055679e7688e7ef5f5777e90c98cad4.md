A man has been charged after a firearms discharge in Harpurhey on Wednesday.

Mohammed Rafiq (14/06/1997), of Wharf Road, Sale, has been charged with one count of possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear and violence.

He was remanded in custody to appear at Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court today (Friday 26 March).

At around 5.30pm on Wednesday 24 March, officers were patrolling close to Moss Bank Way when they heard a loud bang which sounded like a firearm discharging.

A short time later, a suspected firearm was recovered on Norbert Walk.
