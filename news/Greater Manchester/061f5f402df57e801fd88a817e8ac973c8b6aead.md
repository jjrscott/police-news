At around 5.15pm on Thursday 6August 2020, a silver Ford Transit Panel Van and a cyclist were involved in a collision, close to the Huddersfield Road and Stamford Road junction.

It is believed that the cyclist was turning right into Stamford Road when the collision occurred.

The cyclist - a man in his 60s - was taken to hospital but sadly passed away a short time later, despite the best efforts of medical staff.

A 35-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of driving whilst unfit through drink or drugs. He remains in police custody and enquiries are ongoing.

PC Joanne Worsley, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "This is a tragic incident where a man has lost his life, and our thoughts and sympathies are with the family and friends of the man at this incredibly sad time.

"Our investigation remains ongoing and I would like to take this opportunity to ask anyone with information or dash cam footage to contact us as soon as possible. Did you see the vehicle or cyclist in the area at the time? Did you witness the collision?"
