At around 11.35am on Sunday 3 May 2020, police were called by hospital staff reporting a man with serious injuries.

An investigation was launched and officers established that, at around 11.15am, 35-year-old Abdi Omar Ali had been assaulted on Hathersage Road, Longsight.

Following enquiries, Creole McNamee (27/07/92) of Manor Road, Stretford was arrested and taken in to police custody for questioning, where he was subsequently charged with assault.

On Monday 11 May 2020, Abdi sadly died from his injuries.

After pleading guilty to manslaughter at an earlier hearing, McNamee was today (Tuesday 27 October 2020) sentenced at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court to five years and four month imprisonment.

DCI Liz Hopkinson, of GMP's Major Incident Team, said: "This was an unprovoked assault which had a serious consequence - the death of a man. Throughout our investigation, our thoughts have remained with Abdi's loved ones whilst specialist officers have continued supporting them.

"CCTV shows Abdi walking along the road whilst using his phone. A short time later, McNamee pulls up in a white van, exits the vehicle and punches the victim once in the head. The punch causes Abdi to fall backwards to the ground.

"I hope this case serves as a reminder that one punch can kill and that Greater Manchester Police will not tolerate violence in our communities. I also hope it reassures members of the public that we launch investigations which leave no stone unturned and identify offenders as soon as possible."
