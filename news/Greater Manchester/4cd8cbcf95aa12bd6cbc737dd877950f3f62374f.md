Police are appealing for information after a woman had her car stolen in Trafford.

At around 1.15pm on Monday 1 March 2021, the victim was on Pemberton Street, Trafford when she was approached by an unknown man.

The man pulled the woman's car keys from her hand and stole the victim's grey Volkswagen Golf. The victim's laptop and some personal documentation were inside the vehicle.

The man was described as being approximately between 5ft 4in-5ft 7in and of a 'slim' build. At the time of the incident he was wearing dark clothing with a hood and scarf across his face.

Sergeant Rachel Jones, of GMP's Trafford district, said: "Although the victim fortunately received no injuries during the incident, she has been left understandably shaken.

"I would like to appeal to anyone who may have witnessed the offence or may have captured it on their CCTV to please contact us or Crimestoppers, anonymously."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 9169 quoting 1288 01/03/21 or the independent charity - Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
