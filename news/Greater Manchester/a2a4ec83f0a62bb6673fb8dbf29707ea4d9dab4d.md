Shortly before 1am on Sunday 10 November 2019, police were called to reports that a 47-year-old man had been found unconscious on Whitworth Street in the City Centre.

Enquiries have since established that on Chepstow Street at around 9:30pm on Saturday 9 November 2019, the victim was assaulted by three men.

Two men - aged 30 and 35 - have now been arrested on suspicion of section

18 assault. Both men remain in custody for questioning.

Detective Inspector Mark Astbury, of GMP's City of Manchester Division, said:

"This was a vicious attack which has left a man suffering from serious injuries.

"This kind of violence has no place on our streets, and it will not be tolerated.

"While we have two men in custody, our enquiries are very much ongoing and I would implore anyone who has any information that may assist our enquiries to please get in touch with officers."

Anybody with information should contact police on 0161 856 4409 quoting incident number 129 of 10/11/2019, or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
