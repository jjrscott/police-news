Police are appealing to the public for further information after a teenager was left with life-changing injuries following a collision near Manchester Fort shopping centre yesterday afternoon.

At around 4.20pm on Saturday 27 March, officers were called to a report of an incident involving two cars and a motorbike at the junction of Cheetham Hill Road and North Street.

A Silver/Grey Honda motorbike was travelling northbound on Cheetham Hill Road when it collided with a blue Ford Focus ST-Line TDCI.

The rider of the motorbike - a 19-year-old man - suffered life-changing injuries and remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition.

The pillion passenger of the bike - also aged 19 - suffered minor injuries and has been discharged from hospital. He has been arrested on suspicion of theft of a motorcycle and is in custody.

A third vehicle - a black Mercedes A Class - is believed to have been travelling behind the motorbike up Cheetham Hill Road and made off towards Elizabeth Street in a north-westerly direction.

Officers are keen to speak to the driver of the Mercedes about the incident and want to hear from any members of the public who may have witnessed the collision or seen a Mercedes matching the description.

Anyone with information or dash cam footage is asked to call police on 0161 856 1146 quoting incident number 2013 of 27/03/2021. Details can be passed anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
