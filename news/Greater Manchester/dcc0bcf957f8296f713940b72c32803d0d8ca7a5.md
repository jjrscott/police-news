Just after 9pm on Friday 8 January 2021, 53-year-old Mohammed Islam, was struck by his own car following a robbery in Romiley, Stockport.

Mohammed was taken to hospital where he sadly died on Sunday 10 January 2021.

Today (Wednesday 20 January) a 14-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of murder and conspiracy to commit theft. He remains in custody for questioning.

Chief Inspector Liam Boden of GMP's Major Incidents Team said: "This was a tragic incident and my thoughts remain with Mohammed's family and friends as they try to come to terms with their devastating loss.

"Whilst we have made a further arrest, this investigation is still ongoing and I would urge anyone with information about what happened to get in touch with police as soon as you can."
