We were called to reports of a multiple stabbing at the Arndale shopping centre at 11.15am earlier today (Friday 11 October 2019).

At this stage we believe that four people were injured during the incident - not five as previously reported. We will update as the situation becomes clear.

A 19-year-old woman- was taken to hospital with stab wounds. Another woman was also taken to hospital with stab injuries. Both their conditions are described as stable.

A man in his 50s has also been taken to hospital with stab wounds.

A fourth victim - a woman in her 40s - who was not stabbed - has been assessed and did not need to go to hospital following assessment by paramedics.

A man in his 40s - who was arrested at the scene on suspicion of serious assault - remains in custody for questioning.

We will keep you updated.
