Police in north Manchester have seized a cannabis farm with a street value of approximately one million pounds.

As part of an ongoing operation by GMP's City of Manchester Challenger team, officers entered a property in Blackley on Monday 23 September 2019 and discovered the large farm.

No arrests have been made and a scene remains in place as enquiries continue.

Detective Constable Helen Rutter, of GMP's City of Manchester Challenger team, said: "The seizure of this cannabis farm is a significant recovery in our ongoing efforts to tackle and disrupt organised crime in Manchester.

"We believe that the street value of the farm is approximately one million pounds so, not only have we stopped a large amount of drugs from hitting the streets, but we have also struck those responsible directly in the pocket.

"Our team is committed to bringing those involved in organised crime to justice but in order to do that we need intelligence from the local community regarding the activities of individuals connected to organised crime groups.

"Thankfully we have a good relationship with many of our local communities, who are supportive of the work that we do, and we hope that can continue so I want to ask that anybody with information about this cannabis farm, or anybody connected to it, please contact us."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 3735 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
