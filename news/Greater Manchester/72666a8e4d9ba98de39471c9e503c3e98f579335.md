Detectives are appealing for witnesses following a robbery where cigarettes and cash were taken in Bury.

At around 11.40am on 10 November, officers were called to a report of a robbery at Victoria News on Victoria Avenue, Whitefield.

Three men entered the store. One of the men walked behind the till area and started to steal cigarettes whilst the remaining two, armed with metal poles, threatened the shop keeper to open the till.

One of the offenders then walked around the till area whilst another jumped onto the counter and forced the shop keeper to hand over his phone before he threw it to the floor.

The three then made off from the store 60 seconds later on foot towards Charles Street.

Detective Constable Craig Ryder, from GMP's Bury CID, said: "Thankfully no one was injured during this robbery but the member of staff has been left understandably shaken up.

"A number of lines of enquiry have already been followed up and we're now appealing for members of the public to come forward with any information that may be able to assist.

"Anyone with information should contact us on 0161 856 8158 quoting log 1043 of 10/11/2020.

"Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
