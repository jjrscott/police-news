Police arrested the 50-year-old on suspicion of sexual assault and burglary and remains in police custody for questioning.

Shortly before 4.30am on Friday 15 November 2019, police were called to reports of an intruder in a house on Albion Street.

The report stated that a man had entered the property and went into the bedroom of a young girl and sexually assaulted her.

Detective Superintendent Howard Millington, of GMP's Bury district, said: "We would like to thank the public for their swift response to our appeal for information.

"We have worked meticulously to ensure the safety of the local community and to reassure them that their safety is of the upmost importance.

"Our specialist officers are continuing to work closely with the young girl to provide her with full support and to bring the perpetrator of this despicable act to justice."
