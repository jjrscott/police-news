Did you witness an armed robbery in Wythenshawe, Manchester?

Police are appealing for information after an armed robbery took place at St John's Catholic Men's Club, Greenwood Road in Wythenshawe on Monday 14 October 2019.

At around 12.05am two men - one who was carrying a baseball bat - forced a woman that was locking up at St John's Catholic Men's Club to reopen the doors and empty the safe inside.

The men then fled the crime on two mountain bikes.

No one was injured during the robbery however the club staff member was left understandably shaken.

One offender is described as a white man around, 5ft.7 inches tall, of a slim build and with a local accent.

The other offender is described as a white man, tall and chubby. He is further described as wearing dark clothing and spoke with a local accent.
