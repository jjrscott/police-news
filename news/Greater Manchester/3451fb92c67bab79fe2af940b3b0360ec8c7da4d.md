On Friday 11 October, GMP is starting the first of six road side operations in recognition of tyre safety month. This is the perfect time of year to check your car tyres ahead of the colder winter months. We've already experienced an unprecedented amount of rain over the last few weeks, so in order to ensure safety on the roads, it's imperative the tyres on your car can withstand the conditions.

The latest figures show that in 2018 there were a total of 459 road traffic collisions in the UK as a result of illegal, defective or under inflated tyres. In addition to this, 17 people sadly lost their life, with a further 116 suffering serious injuries.

The consequences of driving with illegal tyres could cost you three penalty points on your licence, as well as a fine of up to Â£2,500 per tyre.

GMP is planning six days of action across the force that will aim to increase education and enforcement.

Traffic Police Community Support Officer, Mark Pickford of GMP said: "Tyres are the only thing that connects your car to the road so it's important to make sure they keep you safe.

"There is an easy test to take in order to see if your tyre depth hit the safety make and all you need is a 20p piece. The outside border of the 20p should disappear if your tyres have the correct tread depth, if it doesn't, your tyres may be below the legal limit and you could receive points and a fine.

"The legal tyre depth for cars in the UK and Europe is 1.6mm across the central three-quarters of the tyre. Anything under this could be illegal."

More information on tyre safety can be found online - www.tyresafe.org, www.theaa.com and www.rac.co.uk.
