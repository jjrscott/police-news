At around 11.35am on Thursday 17 September 2020, police received a report that a statue in Wythenshawe Park had been damaged.

An investigation was launched and enquiries have established that, at around 1.40am, three people approached the statue of Oliver Cromwell, climbed on it and covered it in graffiti.

No arrests have been made.

An investigation is underway.

Inspector Ian Thomson, of GMP's City of Manchester district, said: "Repairing this damage will cost thousands of pounds. This behaviour is not acceptable and enquiries are ongoing to identify the people responsible so we can ensure they face justice.

"We know that three people were involved in this incident. We believe they were on foot and entered the park from Wythenshawe Road. I appeal to anyone with information which may assist with our investigation to contact us or Crimestoppers."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 4882 quoting crime number 1164 of 17/09/20 or the independent charity - Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
