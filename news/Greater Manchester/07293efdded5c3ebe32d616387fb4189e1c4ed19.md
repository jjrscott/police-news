Appeal 04

A teenager has died following a fail to stop collision in Wigan.

At around 4.30pm on Tuesday 7 July 2020, police were called to reports of a collision between a car and a 13-year-old boy on Old Road, Ashton in Makerfield.

The boy, 13-year-old Jack Worwood, was taken to hospital with serious injuries, where, despite the best efforts of medical staff, he sadly died earlier today (Wednesday 8 July 2020).

Enquiries indicate that Jack was walking along the pavement when there was a collision involving himself and a Jaguar car. There was then a further collision between the Jaguar and a wall.

The driver and passenger of the Jaguar failed to stop following the collision.

A 15-year-old boy and a 21-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, causing death while uninsured, causing death while unlicensed, and failing to stop at the scene of an accident.

Both remain in custody for questioning.

Sergeant Darren Hancock of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "This is devastating news and our thoughts are wholeheartedly with Jack's family as they struggle to come to terms with what has happened.

"We are determined to find them the answers they deserve and I want to again appeal to the public to come forward with any information or dash-cam footage that may assist us."

Anyone with information should contact GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 0161 856 4741, quoting incident number 1965 of 08/07/20.

Reports can also be made anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
