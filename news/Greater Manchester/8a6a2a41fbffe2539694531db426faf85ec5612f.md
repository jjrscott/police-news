Police investigating the murder of a man in Manchester have made two arrests.

At around 1.15am on Tuesday 14 July 2020 police were called to a report of a disturbance at a property on Carnforth Street, Rusholme.

Officers arrived and found an unresponsive man with head injuries collapsed on a sofa within the property.

Despite the efforts of paramedics the man -aged 59 - was pronounced dead at the scene.

A 22-year-old man and a 26-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of murder. Both men remain in custody for questioning.

Chief Inspector Andrew Butterworth of GMP's Major Incidents Team said: "This is a tragic loss of life and our thoughts remain with the man's family and friends at this incredibly difficult time.

"There will continue to be an increased police presence in the area as detectives complete their enquiries to establish the full circumstances surrounding this awful incident.

"Whilst we have two men currently in custody, our investigation is still very much ongoing and I would urge anyone who has any information at all, no matter how minor you may feel it is, to please speak to police as soon as possible."

Anyone with information should call police on 0161 856 6777 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
