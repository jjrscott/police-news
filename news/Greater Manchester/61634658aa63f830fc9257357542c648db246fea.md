A boy is in hospital after a collision in Moston.

The 10-year-old is currently receiving treatment for serious injuries after officers were called to reports of the collision on Moston Lane outside California Wines at around 6.35pm on Thursday (25 July 2019).

He had crossed the first lane of traffic on his push scooter but was involved in a collision with a black BMW 1 Series as he reached the second lane.

While he remains in a serious condition, his injuries are not thought to be life threatening.

The driver of the BMW stopped at the scene and no arrests have been made.

It is believed that a light coloured Fiat Punto, driving in the opposite direction, had its wing mirror knocked off during the collision.

Police believe there was also a blue Audi A1 behind the Fiat Punto that would have witnessed the incident.

Officers are keen that the drivers of these vehicles, as well as anyone else with information and dashcam footage of the collision to come forward.

Anyone with information should contact GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 0161 856 4741 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
