A further two women have been charged with county lines and modern slavery offences as part of an operation.

On Friday 20 November 2020, officers arrested and charged two women in Oldham.

Stephanie Beard (20/02/1994), of Dumfries Avenue, Oldham, has been charged with conspiracy to supply class A drugs, possession of class A drugs and possession of class B drugs.

Nicole Crighton (18/12/1998), of Wilson Way, Oldham, has been charged with conspiracy to supply class A drugs.

They have both been bailed to appear at Tameside Magistrates' Court on 22 December 2020.

Seven men and four women were previously arrested and charged in October.

On Thursday 1 October, officers from GMP and North Yorkshire Police raided ten addresses in parts of Oldham, Manchester and York as part of a four-month long joint-operation into county lines and modern slavery offences.

Since the inception of the operation \- codenamed Homestead - GMP has been working alongside North Yorkshire Police and local partners as part of a multi-agency response to ensure the safeguarding of vulnerable people coerced into criminal activity.

Anyone with any information should call 101 quoting Operation Homestead.

Details can also be anonymously passed to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
