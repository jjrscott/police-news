Nelly the puppy

At around 2.30pm on Saturday 21 November 2020, police received a report of the earlier theft of a 10-week-old Jack Russell Chihuahua Maltese cross.

Enquiries have established that, between 9am and 12pm, the puppy was taken from the owner's property on Malborough Street, Ashton Under Lyne.

PCSO Stella Hodgkiss, of GMP's Tameside district, said: "It's believed the puppy escaped the home via a cat flap before being removed from the garden.

"I would like to use this opportunity to issue a reminder that theft by finding is a criminal offence.

"I encourage anyone who removed the puppy in good faith or otherwise to return the puppy to the rightful owner or contact the police who can do so."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 9350 quoting 1698 of 21/11/20 or the independent charity - Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111
