Two men have been charged following warrants in Manchester.

A number of warrants were executed yesterday (1 December 2020) in Moss Side, Longsight and the city centre as part of an investigation into the supply of drugs.

Shamsudin Khalifa (01/07/1992), of Leftbank, Manchester, has been charged with three counts of being concerned in the supply of class A and B drugs, four counts of possession with intent to supply class A and B drugs and two counts of possession of criminal property.

Haman Alhamruni (26/06/1998), of Nevada Street, Manchester, has also been charged with conspiracy to supply class A drugs and possession of a class B drug.

They both appeared at Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court this morning (2 December 2020) and remanded until their next appearance at Manchester Crown Court on 4 January 2021.

A 25-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of money laundering yesterday has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.
