An investigation is being carried out by the Greater Manchester Police Professional Standards Branch regarding a serious allegation involving the handling of counterfeit goods by officers.

The matter was reported on Friday 15 November 2019 and was referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), who have made a decision for GMP's Professional Standards Branch to investigate.

22 officers have been placed on restricted duties whilst enquiries continue.

Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts said: "The public rightly expects the highest standards from our officers and as such it is appropriate that we conduct a thorough and robust investigation into the serious concerns raised".
