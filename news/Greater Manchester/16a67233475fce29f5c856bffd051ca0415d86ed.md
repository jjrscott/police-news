A man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a shop in Longsight.

Shortly before 3.55pm on Saturday (30 January 2021), officers were called to reports that a 25-year-old man self-presented at hospital with a stab wound to the neck.

The man was injured following an incident in Ismail Groceries on Stamford Road in Longsight around 25 minutes earlier. He was taken to hospital and has since been discharged.

Rashid Mehmood (03/06/1985), of Northumberland Road, Stockport, has been charged with attempt murder.

He appeared at Manchester Magistrates' Court yesterday (1 February 2021) and has been remanded until his next appearance on a date to be fixed.
