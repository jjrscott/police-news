Footage of incident

Shujaat Ali (10/11/2000) of Balmoral Avenue, Bury was sentenced at Manchester Crown Square Court on Friday 5 February 2021 and has been jailed for two years after pleading guilty to attempted Section 20 assault.

The court heard how In July 2020, a 17-year-old boy was sat at the Abraham Moss Tram Stop with two of his friends when he was approached by Ali who had a knife hidden up his sleeve.

Ali engaged in a conversation with the boy before producing the knife from his sleeve and trying to stab him twice in the torso. Luckily, the boy managed to escape from Ali's reach unscathed.

Detective Constable Leon Cawley-Bowyer, from GMP's City of Manchester division , said: "This was an altercation between two people, which quickly became violent due to the presence of a knife, and could have resulted in a much graver outcome.

"Knife crime is a top priority for GMP, and I hope that this sentencing today sends a clear message that police remain dedicated to tackling the issue of knife crime on our streets, will ensure that those who engage in this type of criminal activity face the consequences."

"Carrying a knife is a serious offence, and I would like take this opportunity to remind the public that there are a number of amnesty bins located across Greater Manchester, where any weapons can be disposed of safely and anonymously. Take a look on GMP's website to find the amnesty bin closest to you: www.gmp.police.uk"
