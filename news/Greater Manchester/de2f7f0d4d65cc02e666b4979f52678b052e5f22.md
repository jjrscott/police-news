A man has been arrested after police recovered a 10 inch knife in Wigan.

Earlier this morning (Sunday 19 January 2020) at 2.50am police were called to a report that a man was running through Church Yard towards Market Square in Wigan Town centre armed with a knife.

Police responded swiftly to the scene and a 21-year-old man was arrested for possession of cocaine and an offensive bladed article in a public place.

Chief Inspector Nicki Tompsett of the Wigan Division said: "A 10 inches long by two inches wide knife was swiftly recovered by one of our GMP officers this morning which could have caused serious harm in a central part of Wigan.

"The weapon has now been seized and will no longer be on our streets which is a great step in reducing knife crime and keeping the people of Wigan safe

"The officer was fearless in recovering the weapon and I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for his swift response and hard work that was aided by Wigan CCTV operators."
