Officers are appealing for witnesses after an 84-year-old man died following a collision in Farnworth.

Shortly after 1.45pm on Thursday 5 September 2019, police were called to reports of a collision involving a pedestrian and a black Toyota Corolla on Market Street at the junction of Church Street.

Emergency services attended and the pedestrian- an 84-year-old man- was taken to hospital with serious injuries, where he has since sadly passed away.

The driver remained at the scene and no arrests have been made.

Enquiries are ongoing.

Police Constable John Cavanagh, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "Our thoughts remain with the man's family at this very difficult time.

"Our investigators have carried out a detailed examination of the scene, and we are working to establish the full circumstances of this incident.

"I would urge anyone who saw the car or the man in the moments leading up to the collision, or anyone with dashcam footage, to please get in touch with us as soon as possible."

Anyone with information should call GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 0161 856 4741 or 101 quoting incident number 1378 of 05/09/2019, or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
