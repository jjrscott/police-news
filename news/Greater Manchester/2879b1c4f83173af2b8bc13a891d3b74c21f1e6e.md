A man has been charged after an NHS staff member was punched in the face and left with a fractured cheekbone at Salford Royal Infirmary on Sunday 29 March 2020.

Daniel Shevlin (29/04/1992), of no fixed abode, has been charged with one count of section 20 assault and one count of section 4a of the Public Order Act.

He has been remanded in custody and will appear at Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court today (Monday 30 March 2020).

Police were called just before 1.50pm on Sunday 29 March 2020 to reports that a man had assaulted a member of NHS staff at a hospital in Salford.

A 27-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of section 20 assault.

The NHS staff member - a man in his 50s - required treatment for a fractured cheekbone but has since been discharged.
