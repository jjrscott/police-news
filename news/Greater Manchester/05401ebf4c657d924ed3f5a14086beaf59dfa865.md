Police are appealing for information following a collision in Rochdale.

At around 3.45pm on Monday 2 March 2020 a man in his 80s was using a pedestrian crossing adjacent to Tesco on Manchester Road, Rochdale.

As he left the crossing, his trailing leg was struck by a passing vehicle.

He was taken to hospital, where he remains receiving treatment to a serious leg injury.

Constable James Senior of GMP's Roads Policing Unit said: "Our thoughts are with the man while he continues his recovery from this collision in hospital.

"This incident occurred on a busy road at a busy time of the day, so we're confident that people will have witnessed it, or may have dash cam footage that can assist our investigations.

"We are particularly keen to speak to a HGV driver who very kindly stopped to assist the injured man and may have vital information regarding the vehicle that struck him.

"If you can help, please get in touch."

Anyone with information should call police on 0161 856 8473 quoting incident 2072 of 02/03/2020. Alternatively, call the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
