Officers are investigating after a woman was injured in a collision in Withington.

Shortly before 9.20pm on Sunday 4 August 2019, a dark grey/blue VW Golf was travelling on Princess Road before turning right onto Whitchurch Road, when it was involved in a collision with a pedestrian who was walking across the street.

The pedestrian - a 19-year-old woman - suffered serious head and shoulder injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment. She has since been discharged to continue her recovery at home.

The driver failed to stop at the scene and investigators are now appealing for any information that could assist their enquiries.

They are particularly keen to speak to anyone who saw the incident take place or saw the car in the area before the collision.

Police Constable Chris Haxby, of Roads Policing, said: "We are appealing to anyone that might know something about this collision, which left a young woman in hospital with serious injuries.

"We have released footage of the collision in the hope that it may help to jog people's memories.

"If you witnessed the collision, or have dash cam footage from around the time which shows a dark grey/blue VW Golf travelling on Princess Road before turning right onto Whitchurch Road, please contact police."

Anyone with information should contact police by calling 0161 856 8809, quoting incident number 3227 of 04/08/19.

Alternatively, information can be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
