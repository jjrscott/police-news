Detectives have released CCTV images following an attempt armed robbery earlier this week.

Just before 8pm on Monday 5 October 2020, officers were called to a report of an attempt armed robbery at Tesco Esso Express on York Street in Heywood.

One man entered the store and threatened a member of staff with a suspected firearm and demanded money whilst another man held the automatic door to the store open.

The pair were then disturbed and made off from the scene empty-handed towards Adelaide Street in the direction of Aspinall Street.

Detective Inspector David Crewe, of GMP's Rochdale division, said: "This was an extremely distressing experience for the person behind the till who was simply doing their job.

"Though you can't see faces clearly, we're hoping that someone may have seen them in the area.

"Thankfully no one was hurt and nothing was taken and we're eager to bring those responsible to justice.

"Anyone with information or anyone who may have seen the men in the nearby area should call 0161 856 4637 quoting incident number 2638 of 05/10/20.

"Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
