At around 9.30pm on Thursday 21 January 2021, police received a report of an armed robbery at a premises on Yew Tree Lane, Dukinfield.

An investigation was launched and enquiries have established that a man entered the premises and, whilst brandishing a firearm, demanded cash from the till. He left the scene on foot, with a quantity of cash, via Mountbatten Avenue and towards the Newton area of Hyde.

No one was injured.

Officers recovered a black baseball cap, black rubber glove, high visibility yellow jacket and a Â£10 note from an alleyway near Bradley Green Primary School.

DC Stephanie Jones, of GMP's Tameside district, said: "Thankfully no one was injured but this will have been a frightening experience for those who were in the shop at the time.

"We want to speak with the man in the CCTV images and I'd ask him or anyone who recognises him to contact us or Crimestoppers.

"I'd also encourage anyone else with information to pass it on."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 9262 quoting 2774 21/01/21 or the independent charity - Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
