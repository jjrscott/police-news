Shortly after 9pm on Wednesday 9 October 2019, police were called to reports of a robbery at a property on Manley Road.

The occupant - an 81-year-old woman- was confronted by three masked men who had entered the property in possession of screwdrivers. She was then threatened before being sprayed with household cleaner.

The offenders fled with a quantity of cash and Asian gold jewellery worth approximately Â£12,000.

The woman suffered mild irritation to her eyes but thankfully, was otherwise uninjured.

Detective Sergeant Nicola Walton, from GMP's City of Manchester Division, said: "An 81-year-old woman was subjected to a terrifying attack in her own home and whilst she wasn't seriously injured, she has been left incredibly shaken by what happened.

"Targeting an elderly woman like this is nothing short of despicable, and we are determined to find those responsible for such a cowardly burglary.

"Unfortunately there is no further description of these men, but if you saw anyone acting suspiciously in the local area or if you have any information that could assist our investigation then please get in touch as soon as possible."

Anyone with information should call police on 0161 856 6018 or 101 quoting reference number 3267 of 09/10/19, or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
