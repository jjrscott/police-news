Tribute

The family of a man who died following a collision on the M60 have paid tribute to him.

At around 11.20am on Thursday 17 September 2020, police were called to reports of a collision on the M60, near junction 24 for Denton.

Officers attended and established that a Honda motorcycle had collided with a stationary Skoda Fabia.

The motorcyclist was taken to hospital with serious injuries but sadly passed away. He has since been formally identified as 66-year-old Alan Brady. His next of kin has been informed.

No arrests have been made and an investigation is underway.

Paying tribute to him, Alan's family said: "Alan Brady - a loving husband to Liz, father to Teresa, Tina, Lawrence and Barbara as well as grandad to Reece, Aaron, Jaydon, Ellie, Ann, Declan and Leona."

"He was one of a kind and will be sadly missed by everyone who knows him."
