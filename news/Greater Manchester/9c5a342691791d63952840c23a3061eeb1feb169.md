Tony Robertson (17/05/2001) of Atlow Drive, Wythenshawe has been charged with murder and threatening another in a public place with a bladed article.

He has been remanded in custody to appear before Manchester and Salford Magistrates Court on Monday 28 September 2020.

At around 5.10pm on Tuesday 22 September 2020, police were called by the ambulance service responding to reports of a stabbing on Royal Oak Road, Wythenshawe.

Emergency services attended and a man was taken to hospital, where he was sadly pronounced dead a short time later. He has since been formally identified as 45-year-old Lee Knott.

Enquiries have established that the victim had just got out of a van and was walking along the road when a group of men started shouting at him. One of the men ran to the victim and stabbed him multiple times. The group of men then ran away.
