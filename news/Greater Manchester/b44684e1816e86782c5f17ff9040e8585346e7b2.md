Police are appealing for more information after a robbery on Bradshaw Street in Oldham.

At around 3.30am on Sunday 26 January 2020, a 26-year-old man was assaulted by a group of around six to seven men when he left a nightclub and headed towards Yorkshire street at the corner of Bradshaw Street.

The group of men viciously kicked and punched the man and stole his phone and a silver linked wrist watch.

The group of men then fled to Yorkshire street towards the Squire Knot pub.

The victim suffered serious injuries including a broken jaw, which required hospital treatment.

The offenders are described as four white men and two mixed race or Asian men who were wearing black jackets. One of the men wore a white light weight bubble jacket with a deep hood. Most of the men wore bags

PC Daniel Berry, of GMP's Oldham district, said: "This was a violent incident which has left an innocent man with serious injuries and we wish him a speedy recovery after this brutal attack.

"We are asking members of the public to be vigilant and to remain with friends whilst out in Oldham town centre - especially after a night out and when leaving nightclubs or bars.

"I would also ask anyone who was on the corner of Bradshaw Street near Harry's Bar or on Yorkshire Street at the time of the attack and saw anything usual or suspicious, no matter how small, to contact police as soon as possible."

Anyone with information about the robbery should call police on 0161 856 8557 quoting incident number 1030 of 28/01/2020.

Details can also be passed on anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
