Officers are appealing for witnesses following a fail to stop collision that has left a woman in serious condition in hospital.

At around 2.33pm on Wednesday 16 December 2020, officers were called to a report of a road traffic collision involving a black Vauxhall Astra vehicle and a pedestrian on Ridgeway Street, Miles Platting.

Emergency services attended and a pedestrian - a 31-year-old woman - was taken to hospital where she remains in a serious condition.

Two occupants in the Vauxhall Astra abandoned the vehicle at the scene and fled on foot.

No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing.

PC Steven Oliver, from GMP's Roads Policing Unit, said: "A woman has been left in a serious condition following this incident and we're doing all we can to establish the circumstances surrounding the collision.

"Our thoughts remain with the woman and her family as she continues to receive treatment in hospital.

"A number of lines of enquiry have been followed up since the incident and now we're appealing for the public to come forward with any information that may assist us.

"We're asking anyone who may have witnessed the collision or were in the area at the time to come forward and help us with our enquiries.

"Anyone who has CCTV or dash-cam footage that also may help with our investigation should also get in touch.

"Anyone with any information should call 0161 856 4765 quoting incident number 1583 of 16/12/20. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 111 555."
