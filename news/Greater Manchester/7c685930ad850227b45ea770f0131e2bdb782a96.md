Three teenagers have been arrested after a boy was stabbed multiple times in Longsight at the weekend.

Shortly after 7.10pm on Saturday 30 January 2021, police were called to reports that a boy had been stabbed in the car park at Asda on Stanley Grove.

Emergency services attended and a 13-year-old boy was taken to hospital with serious injuries. He remains in hospital in stable condition receiving treatment.

Two 16-year-old boys and a 17-year-old boy have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. They have been bailed pending further enquiries.

Detective Inspector Geoffrey Machent, from GMP's City of Manchester division, said: "This incident shocked the community over the weekend and we immediately launched an investigation and have been carrying out a number of enquiries. These arrests are another step forward in our on-going investigation.

"Our thoughts remain with the victim who remains in hospital receiving treatment and his family who are understandably worried.

"Dedicated officers are continuing to patrol the area and anyone with information is still being asked to come forward.

"Anyone with information should call 0161 856 4409 or 101 quoting incident number 2457 of 30/01/2021, or alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
