Police have released images of two men they want to speak to after a man was subjected to a verbal Anti-Semitic attack in Manchester.

On Sunday 17 November 2019 at around 6.10pm, police were called to a report of a hate crime at a takeaway in the Northern Quarter, Manchester.

Two men entered the takeaway and started to verbally abuse an employee whilst waiting for their order. Before they left the premises the two men made a Nazi Salute towards the man.

Since the incident police have conducted several lines of enquiries and analysed CCTV footage of the incident.

Police Constable Lukman Intwala of the City of Manchester Division said: "This was a despicable and vile offence that no one should ever be subjected to.

"Although no arrests have been made we are working hard to find those responsible and have a dedicated team committed to this investigation. I hope this goes to show that such abuse will not be tolerated within Greater Manchester and we will continue to do all that we can to put a stop to attacks of this abhorrent nature.

"We are appealing to members of the public to assist us in identifying the men in these images as we want to speak to them in connection to the incident. If you have any information, please come forward as a matter of urgency."

Anyone with information should call police on 0161 856 3129 quoting incident number 2498 of 17/11/2019, or the independent charity Crime stoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
