Police are appealing for information after a man died following a collision in Bury.

At around 12.00pm on Sunday 26 January 2020, officers were called to reports of a collision involving a car and a bicycle on Manchester Road, Whitefield.

Officers attended and have established that the bicycle collided with a Ford Fiesta which was turning right out of the junction with Sunny Bank Road.

A 53-year-old man sustained serious injuries and was taken to hospital where he sadly died on Monday 27 January 2020.

His next of kin has been informed and officers are supporting them.

The driver of the Ford stopped at the scene.

No arrests have been made.

An investigation is underway.

PC Suzanne Keenan, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "As our investigation progresses, our thoughts remain with the family and friends of the cyclist who sadly lost his life in hospital yesterday.

"I would like to appeal for anyone with information or dash cam footage from the area at the time of the collision to contact us as soon as possible as we believe they may be able to assist officers with their enquiries".

Anyone with information should contact GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 0161 856 4741 quoting 1415 26/01/20.

Alternatively, the independent charity - Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
