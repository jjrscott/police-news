On Saturday 4 April 2020, police were called to reports of a road traffic collision on Seymour Grove in Trafford.

Sadly, 56-year-old Ronald Brown was pronounced dead at the scene.

Paying tribute to Ronald, his family said:

"Ronald was a loyal and loving dad, son, brother and friend. He would give the shirt off his back to help anyone in need, and his positive nature touched everyone he met. He was witty and humble, but also determined and motivated. He would always take the time to encourage us in our various endeavours, and provide support whenever we needed it.

"He will be sadly missed by us all - not just by his family, but also by the wider community."

Tribute: Ronald Brown
