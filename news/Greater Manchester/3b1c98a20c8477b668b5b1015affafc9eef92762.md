Police are appealing for information following a collision in the city centre.

At around 7.50am on Thursday 23 July 2020 a man was stood at the junction of Addington Street and Rochdale Road, Manchester City Centre.

He began to cross the road towards Swan Street where upon he was struck by a silver BMW 330d. At this stage we believe the BMW travelled up Angel Street and crossed Rochdale Road onto Addington Street.

The man, aged 27, was taken to hospital, where he remains for treatment of life-threatening injuries.

The driver of the BMW stopped at the scene to assist police with their enquiries.

No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing.

Sergeant Matthew Picton of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit said: "Our thoughts are with the man as he remains in hospital for treatment.

"Did you see the vehicle driving in the area prior to this collision? Did you witness the collision?

"We're keen to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time, or has any dashcam or CCTV footage that may assist us, to get in touch."

Contact police on 0161 856 4741 quoting incident number 614 of 23/07/2020 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
