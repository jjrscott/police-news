Officers are appealing for witnesses after an elderly man was burgled in Manchester last night (13 January 2021).

Officers were called at around 8pm to a report of an aggravated burglary on Podsmead Road, Wythenshawe where cash, jewellery and a phone were taken.

The man in his 90s answered the door to a delivery driver who asked for directions to an address shortly before a man armed with a knife approached his address, knocked on the door and forced his way in.

The victim handed over a small amount of cash but the offender took more money from his wallet and a gold bracelet before leaving the address and making off on foot.

The 90-year-old suffered minor injuries.

The male is described as white and is believed to have been wearing a black baseball cap, a dark face covering, glasses, a brown jacket and jeans. He is also described as 5ft 8 or 9 in height.

Detective Inspector Christopher Potter, from GMP's City of Manchester division, said: "This was an attack on a vulnerable elderly man who has been understandably left shaken.

"We're determined to find the man responsible and we're now asking the public to come forward that may be able to assist us with our investigation.

"A number of lines of enquiry are being followed up and anyone with information is asked to call 0161 856 6063 quoting log number 2538 of 13/01/21.

"Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
