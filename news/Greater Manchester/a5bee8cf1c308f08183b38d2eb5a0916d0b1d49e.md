Detectives have charged a fourth person with the murder of a man in Wigan in August.

Shortly before 7.50pm on Thursday 6 August 2020, police were called by the ambulance service to reports of concern for a man outside Wigan Parish Church on Bishopgate, Wigan.

Despite the best efforts of emergency services, 34-year-old Steven James McMyler sadly died at the scene.

Michael Callam Wilson (18/08/00), of Northfield Close, Northwood, Kirkby, has been charged with joint-enterprise murder and robbery.

He will appear at Manchester Magistrates' Court today (24 October).

One man and two boys have also previously charged with Steven's murder.
