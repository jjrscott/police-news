A woman has sadly died following a fail-to-stop road traffic collision in Manchester this morning (21 November 2020).

Just after 9.15am, officers were called to a report of a road traffic collision involving a Mercedes van and a pedestrian on Droylsden Road, Newton Heath.

Emergency services attended and despite their best efforts, a 74-year-old woman was confirmed dead at the scene.

Her family have been made aware and are being supported by specialist officers.

It is believed a driver and passenger from the van made off from the scene and an investigation is on-going.

A 42-year-old man has been arrested in the Newton Heath area on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He currently remains in police custody.

Sergeant Brian Orr, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "This is a tragic incident where a woman has sadly lost her life and our thoughts remain with her family at this difficult time.

"An investigation is underway and I would ask any witnesses or anyone with information to get in touch with us.

"I'd also ask anyone with dash-cam footage to get in touch by calling 0161 856 4741 quoting log 943 of 21/11/2020.

"Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
