Detectives are continuing to appeal for the public's help after a man was stabbed in Stretford.

At around 1.20am yesterday (Friday 26 July 2019), police were called to reports that a man had been stabbed on Chester Road.

Enquiries have established that the victim - a 27-year-old man - and his friend got out a taxi on Chester Road, when they were confronted by a group of four males who chased them on foot towards Talbot Road.

The victim suffered a serious stab wound to his back near to the bus stop.

Emergency services attended and he was taken to hospital where he remains in a stable condition.

Two men, aged 21 and 20, and two 17-year-old boys were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. They have since been released under investigation.

Enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Inspector Dave Jones, of GMP's Trafford district, said: "As our investigation progresses, our thoughts very much remain with the victim and his family as they begin to come to terms with what has happened.

"We have a dedicated team of officers working hard to piece together the circumstances which led to a man fighting for his life, and we are continuing to appealing for the public's help to do so.

"I would implore anyone with information, no matter how insignificant or unimportant they think it may be, to please get in touch with us as even the smallest detail could assist our enquiries."

Anyone with information should call police on 0161 856 7527 or 101 quoting incident number 229 of 26/07/2019, or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
