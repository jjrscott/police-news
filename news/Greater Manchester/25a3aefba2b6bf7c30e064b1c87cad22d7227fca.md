A man who threatened a woman during a burglary in Stockport has been jailed.

At around 11.25am on Friday 13 September 2019, police were called to reports of a burglary and robbery on Sandy Lane in the Romiley area.

The prosecution told the court that Matthew Bayley (19/10/90), of no fixed abode, gained entry to the property. A short time later, he was confronted by a member of family who also had access.

Bayley told the woman to put her hands behind her back and get on the floor. He threatened her by saying, if she didn't, he would tie her up or attack her.

Bayley stole jewellery and two car keys before fleeing the scene.

In the time that followed, he was arrested and questioned by detectives.

Bayley pleaded guilty to burglary and robbery. Yesterday (Thursday 5 December 2019), he was sentenced to four years imprisonment at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court.

Detective Constable Laura Burgess, of GMP's Stockport division, said: "This was a terrifying ordeal for the woman involved so I'm pleased with today's result.

"No one should be made to feel as if their homes are not safe and, therefore, I hope today's result provides a measure of comfort to those affected by this case.

"Crimes of this nature will not be tolerated across Greater Manchester and, please let it be known, if you are thinking of taking part in this type of criminal activity you will be brought to justice."
