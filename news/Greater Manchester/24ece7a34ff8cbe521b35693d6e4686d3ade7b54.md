At around 5.50pm on Sunday 7 June 2020, police were called to reports of a collision involving a car and a bicycle on Moorside Road, Worsley.

Officers attended and established that a Range Rover Evoque and the bicycle had collided near the junction with Arthur Street. The Range Rover then collided with a parked Suzuki Alfo and Ford Transit Connect.

The cyclist - a 30-year-old woman - was taken to hospital with serious injuries.

A 55-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of driving whilst above the specified alcohol limit and causing serious injury by dangerous driving. She remains in police custody for questioning.

An investigation is underway.

PC Philip Shaw, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the cyclist and her loved ones, as she receives hospital treatment for serious injuries.

"Enquiries are ongoing and we are keen to hear from anyone who has information or dash cam footage from the area at the time which may assist us with our investigation."

Anyone with information or dash cam footage should contact the Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 0161 856 4741 or the independent charity - Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
