Officers are appealing for witnesses following a large scale violent disorder in Wythenshawe and Sale.

Between 6pm and 11 pm on Thursday 31 October 2019, a large number of motorbikes - in excess of 300 - were causing disorder across these areas.

The bikes were being driven in a dangerous manner on the motorway network and on the pavements around Wythenshawe and Sale. They were also blocking the roads.

A number of the offenders were in possession of weapons, including knives and a sword.

A large group of the males were also seen congregated on Altrincham Road and South Moor Road close to Wythenshawe Hospital, and also in Wythenshawe Park.

The suspects are described as wearing dark clothing and motorbike helmets with their hoods up.

If you witnessed the incident, or have dashcam footage from around that time, please contact the police on 0161 856 4882. Images and video can be emailed to: operation.sandwell@gmp.police.uk

Information can also be passed on anonymously by calling the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, quoting Greater Manchester Police log 1998 of 31/10/2019.
