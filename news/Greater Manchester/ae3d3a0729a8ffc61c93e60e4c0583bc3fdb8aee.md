A third teenager has been charged with the murder of Steven McMyler.

A 17-year-old from the Merseyside area - who cannot be named for legal reasons - has been charged with Joint Enterprise Murder. He was remanded in custody and will appear at Manchester Magistrates Court this morning (Saturday 15 August 2020).

Shortly before 7.50pm on Thursday 6 August 2020, police were called by the ambulance service to reports of concern for a man outside the church on Bishopgate, Wigan.

Despite the best efforts of emergency services, Steven James McMyler sadly died at the scene.

A 19-year-old man and a 13-year-old boy have both previously also been charged with murder.
