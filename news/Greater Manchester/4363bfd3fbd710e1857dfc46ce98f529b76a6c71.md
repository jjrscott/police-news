Officers have released CCTV images of men they want to speak to following a disorder in Bolton.

At around 12.30pm on 29 December 2019, officers were called to a large-scale fight on Church Bank in Bolton involving a number of football supporters.

During the disorder, involving Bolton Wanderers and Shrewsbury Town supporters, a man was kicked to the head which left him unconscious for several minutes and left alone until passers-by stopped to help him and recover him to safety.

PC Rob Smith, of GMP's Specialist Operations, said: "This kind of disorder following a football match is not acceptable and could have resulted in even more people getting injured.

"The incident happened some time ago but a number of lines of enquiry have been followed up with no other option than for the public to help us identify them.

"Anyone who may recognise the men in the images is asked to call 0161 856 5671 or email hub.k@gmp.police.uk quoting log number CRI/06KK/0000679/20.

"Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
