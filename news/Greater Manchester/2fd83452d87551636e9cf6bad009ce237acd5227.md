Greater Manchester Police (GMP) is encouraging road users to take extra care as the force supports the NPCC - One Road One Week campaign.

The campaign, which runs from Monday 14 to Sunday 20 September 2020, sees forces from across the country running enforcement initiatives with a focus on people who are driving for work.

GMP will be supporting the national campaign with a series of roadside operations across Greater Manchester with a focus on speed, together with driver behaviour and vehicle maintenance.

Sadly across Greater Manchester, officers have seen an increase in offences such as these playing a part in road users and pedestrians being killed or seriously injured on our roads.

Chief Inspector Matt Bailey-Smith explains more: "We are doing a series of targeted roadside operations across the force as we look to reduce driving offences whilst ensuring people stay safe on our roads.

"Deaths on our roads are tragic and many accidents can be completely avoidable by driving carefully, to the conditions on the road and following the laws that are in place to protect us all.

"My officers will be out using a range of enforcement measures including roadside stops, mobile speed vans and ANPR technology as we look to reduce the number of incidents that are happening on our roads.

"Whilst our targeted operations are happening across Greater Manchester, we also need the public's help to report any offences they might see.

"If you have any concerns whilst out on the roads then please report them to us via the dedicated link on our website https://www.gmp.police.uk/ro/report/rti/rti-b/report-a-road-traffic-incident/ or by calling 101. Always dial 999 in an emergency."

Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime, Bev Hughes said: "We urge people to take care on the roads of Greater Manchester - with more than 60 families losing loved ones on our roads last year and a further 600 people suffering serious injuries.

"Collisions are often the result of speeding or being distracted at the wheel - even a moment's lapse of attention can cause an accident. So stay alert, watch what's happening and think ahead. Lives can be wrecked in an instant and the consequences last a lifetime."
