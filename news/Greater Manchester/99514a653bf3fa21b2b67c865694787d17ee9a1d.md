Police are appealing for witnesses after an elderly couple were seriously injured in a collision in Stalybridge.

Shortly after 12.20pm on Tuesday 3 September 2019, officers were called to reports of a collision between a red Hyundai Amica and a silver Audi A3 at the junction of Astley Road and Stamford Street.

The driver and front seat passenger of the Hyundai, a man in his 70s and a woman in her 80s, were taken to hospital where their conditions are described as serious but stable.

The driver of the Audi, a man in his 50s, was taken to hospital with minor injuries.

PC Paul Joynson, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "The elderly couple have very serious injuries and we are appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision, saw either of the two vehicles before the incident or has dash-cam footage which may help our enquiries to get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 0161 856 4741 quoting incident number 1174 of 03/09/19. Information can also be passed on anonymously by calling the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
