Tribute: Stephen Rimmer

Stephen Rimmer was assaulted a week before self-presenting at Royal Oldham Hospital on Wednesday 21 August 2019.

He suffered a cardiac arrest and was placed into an induced coma. He sadly never woke up and passed away on Saturday 7 March 2020, aged 42.

A forensic post-mortem established there was a causational link between Stephen's injuries and his cause of death. A murder investigation has been launched.

Paying tribute to Stephen, his family said: "Stephen was a caring son and brother, and a wonderful stepfather to Kimberley. He was also very popular with friends.

"Stephen was loving and kind; he touched the hearts of many. He was a gentle giant who lived his life to the full.

"His death has left us utterly devastated. We would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone during this awful time for their support."
