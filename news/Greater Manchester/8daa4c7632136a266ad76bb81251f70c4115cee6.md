A wanted man has been arrested after being sniffed out by one of GMP's newest four-legged recruits.

Officers were called to a report of a stolen vehicle from an address on Greenbank Crescent in Marple in the early hours of today (25 November 2020).

The vehicle, a Hyundai I10 believed to have been stolen, was being followed by officers before it was abandoned near Barnfield Road West in Adswood.

Police Dog Kyp, who has only been operational for a few weeks after finishing his training course at the end of September, attended with his handler.

Despite being a rookie member of the canine bunch, PD Kyp hit the ground running after finding a wanted man in connection with the incident hidden in a garden on in Adswood.

19-month-old PD Kyp and his handler carried out the search and traced a man hidden on Melrose Avenue.

A key thought to be from the Hyundai was also located.

A 37-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of burglary and robbery offences. He remains in custody at this time.

Detective Constable Paul Garner, of GMP's Stockport District, said: "The work of our police dog and the handler was priceless in finding this man hidden in a garden.

"The stolen vehicle has since been recovered by officers and will be examined before returning to its rightful owner. A man now remains in custody and enquiries are on-going."
