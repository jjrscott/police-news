On Thursday 22 October 2020, police executed a warrant at a property on Higher Lime Road - the home address of Scott Robinson (12/01/78).

During a search of the property, officers found a firearm.

A short time later, Robinson was arrested, taken in to police custody for questioning and charged with possession of a firearm.

After pleading guilty at an earlier hearing, today (Thursday 14 January 2020), Robinson was sentenced at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court to five years imprisonment.

Detective Chief Inspector Chris Mossop, of GMP's Serious Crime Division, said: "This warrant was executed as part of an ongoing operation to tackle serious and organised crime. I hope this reassures members of the public that Greater Manchester Police is committed to making our communities safer.

"Though officers proactively gather intelligence, these investigations rely somewhat on those who live and work in our communities. I would therefore like to use this opportunity to encourage anyone with information about serious or organised crime to contact us directly or Crimestoppers, anonymously."
