Detectives are urging residents to be vigilant in Bury following a number of reported burglaries.

An elderly couple answered the door to two males who pushed the pair back and forced their way into their home on Walmersley Road and made off with cash and electronics at around 7.10pm on 26 February 2021.

The males made off on foot.

No one was injured but colleagues from the ambulance service attended as a precaution.

Detectives are looking at whether other reported incidents in Bury where elderly occupants have been targeted are linked.

Detective Sergeant Stuart Round, from GMP's Bury CID, said: "This was a distressing incident for the elderly couple who answered the door to the two males who asked about a missed delivery before they forced their way in.

"Thankfully, no one was injured but they've been left understandably shaken.

"We currently believe this incident may be linked to other reported burglaries due to the similar circumstances and we would ask residents to be vigilant but come forward with any information that may assist with our investigation.

"Anyone with information is asked to call 0161 856 64540 quoting log number 2459 of 26/02/21.

"Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
