EFIT - SKG 1- 20_ CRO 06 MM- 0000700- 20

Police investigating the attempted abduction of a child have released an e-fit image of a man they want to speak to.

Between 3.15pm and 3.45pm on Monday 13 January 2020 a girl aged 14 was walking close to the junction of Norris Road and Derbyshire Road South in Sale.

She became aware of a parked dark grey 4 x 4 type vehicle. The driver, who was the sole occupant of the car, asked while still seated in the car for the girl to get in.

She refused and walked away.

In addition to the E-fit, the man is further described as white, of pale complexion, around six feet tall, aged 25 to 40. He had long black hair, scraped into a 'man bun' or 'top knot', held in place by a black bobble, but some hair came down to his shoulders.

He had a slim face with defined cheekbones. He spoke with a Mancunian accent. He was wearing a long-sleeved grey round-necked cotton T shirt with a pocket on the left breast.

Police are treating the incident as isolated.

There will be increased police patrols in the area while officers continue their investigations.

Detective Constable Oliver Barton of GMP's Trafford District said: "Do you recognise the image we're releasing today?

"Perhaps you were in the area at the time and saw something that looked out of place?

"If you have any information or dash-cam footage that may help our enquiries, please contact police."

Police can be contacted on 0161 856 7747 quoting incident 2383 of 13/01/20. Alternatively, contact the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
