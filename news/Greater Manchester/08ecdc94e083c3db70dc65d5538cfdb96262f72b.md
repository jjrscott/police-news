At around 8am on Thursday 5 December 2019, police were called to Mellor Street, Rochdale to a report of an assault on a 43-year-old man.

The offender asked the victim for the time before attacking him with a sharp instrument, causing a laceration to the man's stomach.

The victim required hospital treatment for his injury and has since been discharged.

The offender was described as a white man, around 5ft 9inches tall , aged in his early 20s, dressed in a black hoody with the hood up.

"I would like to reassure the public that we are taking this incident very seriously and I am particularly keen to speak to anyone that was on or around Mellor Street at the time of the attack - did you hear or see anything unusual or suspicious that could assist us?."
