Greater Manchester Police (GMP) officers based in Stockport have come together, with local residents and businesses, to support NHS workers.

Since Government regulations came into place and COVID-19 started putting real pressure on the NHS, Stockport officers were keen to do what they could to make the lives of health care workers just that little bit easier.

With the help of McVitie's they were able to deliver workers at Stepping Hill Hospital A&E, a large supply of biscuits to get them through those well-earned tea breaks, as well as toys and more sweet treats, which were donated by GMP staff and officers, for the staff and patients on the hospital's COVID-19 ward. A local resident kindly made 75 washable masks, which officers delivered to a local GP surgery. Officers also got in touch with Mercedes, who donated 200 disposable seat covers which have been given to community nurses to keep them protected whilst on patient visits.

Chief Superintendent Shaun Donnellan, of GMP's Stockport District, said: "It's great to be able to give back to our NHS colleagues who are working so hard during this challenging time.

"I am thankful to the local community and businesses who have supported us not only by doing their bit to protect the NHS, by following Government guidelines, but who have gone above and beyond and allowed us to deliver these well-deserved treats and PPE to our local NHS workers."
