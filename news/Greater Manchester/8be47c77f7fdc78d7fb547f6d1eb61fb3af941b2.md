A man has been arrested after officers uncovered £50k worth of suspected drugs and a substantial amount of cash in Derbyshire.

At around 6am, officers executed warrants on Kingfisher Way and Howards Meadow in Simmondley and Woolley Bridge Road in Glossop, Derbyshire.

Five kilos of suspected cannabis was found in vacuum-packed bags valued at £50k along with approximately £80k in cash.

An 42-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of money laundering and possession with intent to supply. He remains in custody at this time.

Detective Constable Jake Orr, of GMP's Tameside Challenger Team, said: "Today's warrants have led to a substantial find and are a huge step in our on-going commitment to tackling drugs and the distribution of them across Greater Manchester.

"There is always a lot of work going on behind the scenes to tackle drugs and I would ask the community to come forward with any information that may assist us.

"Any information or concerns may be vital to our on-going investigations and residents can report anything by calling 101."
