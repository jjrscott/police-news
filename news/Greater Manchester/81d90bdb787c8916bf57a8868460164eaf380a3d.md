"We have a suspect in custody, and our detectives remain committed to thoroughly investigating these illegal raves to identify and pursue anyone involved in the organisation of them as well as anyone who was involved in the serious incidents that occurred.

"I would like to thank the public for their support so far in helping us to gather the intelligence which has led to this second arrest. Please do continue to contact us with any information you may have about last weekend's raves or any planned for the future via our website or 101."
