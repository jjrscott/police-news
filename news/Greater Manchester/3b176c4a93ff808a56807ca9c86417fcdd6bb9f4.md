Police are appealing for witnesses following a robbery outside a shop on Princess Road on Monday 30 December 2019.

Officers were called at 11.45am to reports that two men arrived at a local newsagent's on Princess Road - close to the junction with Claremont Road - and proceeded to threaten two members of staff in a cash transit van with an unknown weapon.

The two stole a large quantity of cash before making off along Princess Road.

No arrests have been made and no one was injured.

An investigation is now underway to ascertain further details about the incident.

Detective Inspector Stephen Wiggins, of GMP's City of Manchester Division, said: "We understand the offenders were both wearing black clothing with their faces covered and fled prior to officers arriving at the store.

"We now have a team of detectives working to piece together the circumstances surrounding this crime and we are also working closely with the management of the company.

"If you were around the area at the time and saw men who were acting suspiciously in the area and matching the description then please get in touch with us as soon as possible."

Anyone with any information should call 0161 856 4409 quoting incident number 1026 of 30/12/2019. Details can also be passed anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
