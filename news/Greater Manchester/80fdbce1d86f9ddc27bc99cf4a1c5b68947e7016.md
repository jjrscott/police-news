Police are appealing for information following a two-car collision in Bolton.

At around 6.30pm on Wednesday 14 August 2019, police were called to Lostock Lane to reports of a collision involving two VW Golf cars.

Emergency services attended and six people were taken to hospital.

Two people - a 23-year-old woman and a 24-year-old man - who were both in the first VW Golf - were taken to hospital with serious injuries. They remain there in a stable condition.

Four people who were in the second VW Golf - a 21 year old man, 22-year-old man and two 23-year-old men - were also taken to hospital with serious injuries. Two have been released from hospital and are in police custody. Two still remain in hospital and are in a stable condition.

Police are investigating whether this collision is linked to an incident which occurred a short time earlier on the same road.

Initial enquiries have established that offenders damaged a parked BMW car and made off in a VW Golf car.

Officers are particularly keen to speak to anyone who may have dash-cam footage from the area around the time of the incident.

Anyone with information should contact Detective Sergeant Craig Wallace of GMP's Bolton District on 0161 856 5757, quoting incident number 2554 of 14/08/19. Reports can also be made anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
