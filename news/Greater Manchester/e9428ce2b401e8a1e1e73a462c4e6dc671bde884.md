A man has died following a collision in Hyde.

At 12.50am today, Monday 12 August 2019, officers were on patrol when a red Volkswagen Golf failed to stop for them and a pursuit developed.

The investigation so far indicates that officers had lost sight of the vehicle and found it a short while later. It had been involved in a collision with an oncoming blue BMW on Manchester Road and it had then collided with a building.

The sole occupant of the Golf sadly died at the scene.

The driver and passenger of the BMW were taken to hospital for treatment for their injuries, which are not believed to be life threatening.

Superintendent Chris Allsop, said: "The family of the man who sadly lost his life have been informed and are being supported by family liaison officers.

"The incident has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct by GMP's Professional Standards Branch in line with normal policy. The IOPC are independently investigating the circumstances of this incident and GMP will fully support this investigation.

"The scene will remain in place while the investigation remains ongoing."
