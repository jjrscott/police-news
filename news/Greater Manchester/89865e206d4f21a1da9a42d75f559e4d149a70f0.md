A man has been charged after the murder of a man almost 26 years ago.

On 25 February 1994, Jason Comerford - aged 21 - was fatally stabbed in the neck whilst on George Leigh Street near to Great Ancoats Street in Manchester. A lengthy investigation was launched, but despite extensive enquiries at the time the case remained open.

Following a review of this investigation by officers from the Greater Manchester Police's Cold Case Review unit and further enquiries by the Major Incident Support Unit on Tuesday 18 February 2020, Geoffrey Strike (17/01/1945), formerly of the Manchester area, has been charged with murder.

He will appear at Manchester City Magistrates Court today (Wednesday 19 February 2020).
