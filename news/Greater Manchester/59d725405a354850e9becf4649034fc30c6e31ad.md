Shortly after 3am on Tuesday 24 March 2020, police were called by the ambulance service to Wigan Road, Standish, Wigan, to reports of an unexplained death.

Despite the best work of paramedics, a 70-year-old woman was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

Enquiries have since established that the woman had fallen.

A 72-year-old man was arrested, but has since been released with no further action taken.

Detective Inspector Philip Housley of GMP's Wigan division, said: "Following the woman's tragic death yesterday, it was important that the necessary steps were taken to ensure the incident was investigated thoroughly and properly.

"Having received the results from the post mortem and completed a full forensic investigation, we are now satisfied that her death was non suspicious and the man has been released with no further action taken.

"Our thoughts remain with the woman's family at this distressing time."
