An independent investigation is underway after a collision between a police car and a pedestrian left a 15-year-old boy with critical injuries.

At around 9.30pm on Saturday 26 December 2020, officers were responding to a Grade 1 domestic disturbance incident when they were involved in a collision with a pedestrian on Garners Lane in Stockport.

Police stopped and administered trauma care to a 15-year-old boy until the arrival of paramedics.

The boy was taken to hospital with a serious head injury, and remains in a critical condition.

The incident has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) in line with normal procedure, and an independent investigation is underway.

Superintendent Marcus Noden, GMP's divisional commander for Stockport, said: "This is a terribly sad incident and our thoughts are with the young boy and his loved ones, who are being offered support by our specially-trained officers during this distressing time.

"This is an incident that police officers wish to never occur, and support is also being offered to the officers involved in last night's events.

"It is important that a thorough and independent investigation now takes place, and the IOPC will be leading with their enquiries into this incident; therefore it would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this time."
