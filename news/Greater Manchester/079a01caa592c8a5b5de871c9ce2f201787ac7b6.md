Police are appealing for witnesses following a burglary in Stalybridge.

The incident occurred sometime between 3.40am and 3.50am on Wednesday 10 March 2021 at a property on Cecil Street, Stalybridge in Tameside.

Officers attended and enquiries established that a man had entered the address by drilling the lock and gaining access through the rear door.

Two sets of car keys were taken, as well as the victim's vehicle - a matte grey Peugeot GTI.

The man is described as white. He was wearing a mask, bright blue trainers, a dark coloured hoodie, a black cap and grey tracksuit bottoms with black gloves at the time of the incident.

PC Vanessa Gilbert, of GMP's Tameside district, said: "This is a shocking incident, where the man has been inside the address, while the victim and their loved ones were sleeping upstairs.

"The victim has now been left without a vehicle, but also fearful of being in their own home.

"The investigation team are currently following all available lines of enquiry to try and recover the victim's vehicle, as well as identify and bring the person responsible to justice.

"We are keen to speak to anyone who may recognise the man in the footage or has since seen the vehicle."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 9262 quoting incident number 324 of 10/03/21.

Alternatively, information can be passed on to the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
