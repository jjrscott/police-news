Officers are appealing for information after a 16-year old girl was raped on Birch Road yesterday (Wednesday 15 January 2020).

At around 5pm, the girl was walking through an alley off Birch Road when she was pushed to the ground by a man who raped her.

The offender is believed to be either black or of dual-heritage, 5ft 8ins tall, of a medium build and aged approximately between 30-40 years old. At the time of the incident he was wearing blue jeans and smelt strongly of aftershave.

A cordon remains in place whilst investigation work is carried out the scene.

Superintendent Richard Hunt, of GMP's Rochdale district, said: "This was a very distressing incident for the young girl. Her welfare is a top priority for us, and we have specialist officers currently supporting her as we try to establish the full circumstances surrounding this incident.

"I would like to reassure the public that we are doing all we can to trace the person responsible and bring them to justice and you will see increased patrols around the area in the coming days.

"This incident took place at a relatively busy time of day, and I am appealing for any witnesses or anyone who have seen something suspicious to contact us. Even the smallest detail could be of the upmost importance in helping us with our enquiries."

Anyone with any information should contact police on 0161 856 4646, quoting incident number 2066 of 15/01/2020. Reports can also be made anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
