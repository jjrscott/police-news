Three men from Salford have been served with four-year civil injunction orders as part of GMP's ongoing operation into serious and organised crime in the city.

James Swindells (12/08/1998) of Hereford Road, Mitchum Fisher (28/07/1999) of Russell Road, and Tyler Lomas (12/11/1997) of no fixed address, were each handed a four-year order at a hearing at Manchester County Court on Wednesday 30 September 2020.

The civil injunction, under part one of the Anti-Social and Behaviour Crime and Policing Act, was ordered after an application from GMP as part of Operation Naseby - the dedicated response to organised crime in the area - with support from Salford City Council.

The conditions outlined in the order prevent Swindells, Fisher and Lomas from entering particular areas of the borough, and from making contact with specified individuals for the next four years.

Also included in the conditions is an order preventing them from inciting or causing conduct that is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to any person within the area of Salford, as well as possession of a bladed article or hammer.

Any suspected breach of the provisions can lead to arrest and subsequent imprisonment or fine for being in contempt of court.

Since the inception of the Operation Naseby disruption hub in April 2020, there have been 117 arrests, 101 vehicles seized and 46 house searches.

GMP have also been working alongside partners in Salford City Council as part of Project Gulf, an initiative dedicated to tackling organised crime in the city with a view to deter reoffending as well as taking down criminal groups.

Detective Chief Inspector Rick Thompson, of GMP's Salford division, said: "This civil injunction is a significant result and one that we believe will play a further part in helping us keep the streets of Salford clear of serious and organised crime.

"While we are relentlessly working to ensure those involved in criminal activity are brought through the courts and face justice, we are keen to continue using whatever legal avenues are available to us to disrupt the activity taking place between individuals operating in criminal groups.

"Any breaches of these orders are a serious offence and it is important that anyone who suspects there to be any breaches of these civil injunctions contact police on 101 or Crimestoppers with any information they may have."

Councillor David Lancaster, lead member for environment and community safety, Salford City Council, said: "This is welcome news and an example of good partnership working."

Anyone with any information should contact police on 101 quoting Operation Naseby. Details can be passed anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
