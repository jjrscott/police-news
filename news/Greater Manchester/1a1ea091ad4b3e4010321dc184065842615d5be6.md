Shortly after 1am on Monday 16 September 2019, police were called to reports of an attempted burglary, involving three men wearing dark clothing, at a property on Canterbury Road.

Officers attended and became suspicious of a black VW Golf on nearby Rochester Road.

As officers got out of their vehicle to speak to the occupants, the VW Golf accelerated towards them and collided with the police vehicle.

One of the officers managed to get back into the police car, however his leg was trapped in the door and subsequently crushed by the VW Golf as it made off.

As a result, the officer suffered significant injuries and is currently recovering at home. It is unlikely he will be able to return to work for a number of months.

The VW Golf which was involved in the incident was bearing false plates and would have sustained significant damage during the incident.

Detectives are appealing for any witnesses who may have any information about the incident to come forward.

Members of the public are advised not to approach the vehicle or its occupants.

Anyone with information about the incident or the individuals involved can contact Stretford CID on 0161 856 7752, quoting incident number 126 of 16/09/19, or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
