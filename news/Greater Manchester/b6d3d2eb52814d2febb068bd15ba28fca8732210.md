Shortly before 4am on Saturday 29 February 2020, a 19-year old woman reported to police that she had been raped on Charles Street in Manchester.

The victim first met the offender during a night out in Manchester earlier that evening. After leaving the club on Princess Street at around 3:30am on foot, the man raped her behind a car park off Charles Street.

A 20-year-old man who self-presented at a police station yesterday evening (Wednesday 18 March 2020) has been arrested on suspicion of rape. He has since been released under investigation.

Detective Constable Katy Shadwell, of GMP's City of Manchester division, said: "This was a horrific attack which has had a significant impact on the victim, leaving her feeling violated and unsafe. She is being supported by specialist officers.

"Although we have made an arrest in connection to this crime, I would like to stress that our enquiries remain ongoing.

"If you were in the area at the time and have any information that can assist our investigation, please contact police immediately."

Anyone with any information can contact police on 0161 856 4409 quoting incident number 533 of 29/02/2020.

Alternatively, information can be passed on anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
