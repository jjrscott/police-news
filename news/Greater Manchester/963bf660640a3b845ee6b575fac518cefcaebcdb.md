At around 10:40pm on Friday 24 January 2020, police were called to reports of a collision between a grey Audi A6 and a pedestrian on Bury New Road near the junction with Great Cheetham Street East.

The pedestrian - a 35-year-old-man - was taken to hospital with a serious head injury, where he remains in a critical condition.

The driver remained at the scene to speak with officers and no arrests have been made.

Bury New Road was closed at the Junction of Great Cheetham Street East while investigation work was carried out - but has since been reopened.

Enquiries are ongoing.

Police Sergeant Andrew Page, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: ""Sadly this incident has left a man in a critical condition, and we are keen to establish the circumstances behind this collision. We are therefore appealing to the public for further information.

"I am aware that it was not a busy time of day, however I am hopeful that there are witnesses who will be able to assist us further with our enquiries.

"If you were around the area at the time and witnessed this collision, or have any dash cam footage of before or after the collision took place, please contact police as soon as possible."
