Shortly before 11.35am yesterday (Thursday 24 October 2019), police were called to reports that a blue lorry had collided with a cyclist on Deansgate.

The lorry was turning onto Deansgate from John Dalton Street when it collided with the cyclist.

Emergency services attended and the 20-year-old cyclist was taken to hospital where he remains in a critical condition.

The driver of the lorry remained at the scene to speak to officers and no arrests have been made.

Enquiries are ongoing.

Police Constable John Harrison Gough, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "A young man is still in a critical condition in hospital following this incident and we are doing all we can to support him and his family as he receives specialist treatment.

"We are working to establish the circumstances that led to this collision and since it happened at a busy time of day in the city centre, we're hoping there are a number of witnesses that could help us.

"I'd ask any witnesses or anyone with any information, dash-cam or CCTV footage to please get in touch as soon as possible."

Anyone with information should call GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 0161 856 4741 or 101 quoting incident number 1131 of 24/10/2019, or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
