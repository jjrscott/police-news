Police are investigating after a car was driven at pedestrians in Manchester city centre following a disturbance at a nightclub.

Shortly after 3.20am police were called to Twenty Twenty Two club on Dale Street following a report of people fighting.

After being ejected from the premises the altercation continued outside before a car - a black Audi S3 - was driven at a man outside.

A man was taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

Two other men were taken to hospital with minor injuries and have since been discharged.

Officers are investigating reports that a firearm was discharged during the incident.

The car remains outstanding and enquiries are ongoing to trace it.

A scene remains in place on Dale Street.

The incident is not being treated as terrorism-related.

Detective Inspector Claire Moss of GMP's City of Manchester Division said: "This was a shocking incident that could quite easily have resulted in much more serious injuries.

"We would appeal for anyone with information to contact us as soon as possible.

"Did you witness the altercation inside the venue or see or see the vehicle outside the club?

"If you have any details or footage that can assist our enquiries, please get in touch."

Anyone with information should call police on 0161 856 4409 or the independent charity, Crimestoppers, on 0800 555 111.
