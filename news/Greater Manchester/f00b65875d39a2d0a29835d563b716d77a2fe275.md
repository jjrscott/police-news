Officers have released images of stolen property after a family returned from a night away to find that they had been burgled and a quantity of expensive jewellery, watches and electrical goods had been stolen.

The burglary occurred sometime between 9am on Thursday 16 January 2020 and 12:30pm on Friday 17 January 2020 and was reported to police a short while later.

Officers attended a property on Falcon Drive, Middleton following the report and enquiries have established that the offenders forced entry.

No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing.

PC Amran Ali, of GMP's Rochdale division, said: "This family has returned to their home to find that it has been burgled and a number of valuable items have been stolen.

"I absolutely recognise the impact of having your home broken into which is why investigating burglary and bringing offenders to justice is a priority for GMP. We are doing all we can to find those responsible and reunite this family with their stolen property.

"I would ask members of the public to take a good look at the photos provided and if you have any information about any of these items please get in contact with police as soon as possible."
