Did you witness a robbery in Cheetham Hill?

Detectives are appealing for information after an armed robbery at a jewellery shop on Cheetham Hill Road on Wednesday 28 August 2019.

At around 10.00am, five men forced entry to the shop, threatened the shop keeper with weapons and demanded a quantity of jewellery.

No one was injured during the robbery, but they were left understandably shaken.

The offenders fled in a dark coloured Kia Sportage car with a quantity of unique Asian jewellery.

Three offenders were described as wearing all black clothing and the other two offenders were further described as wearing dark grey clothing. All offenders were wearing balaclavas and gloves at the time of the offence.

The group were armed with sledgehammers, pickaxes and machetes.

Police are now releasing images of some of the stolen jewellery as part of enquiries.

Anyone who has any information about the robbery or dash cam footage of the incident should call police on 0161 856 1146 quoting incident number 0911 of 28/08/2019.

Details can also be passed on anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
