At around 5pm on Thursday 26 March 2020, police were called to reports of a robbery on Cross Street, Manchester.

Two men on bicycles attacked and robbed a man - who was in his early 20's.

The offenders stole the man's mobile phone, however the victim was able to detain one of the offenders at the scene and retrieve his phone.

A man, aged 22, has been arrested on suspicion of robbery. He has been bailed pending further investigation.

Constable Leon McLaughlin, of GMP's City of Manchester division, said: "This was an opportunist attack and there is no place for this type of offending in Greater Manchester.

"Whilst we have one man in custody, our enquiries are very much ongoing and I am appealing for anyone who may have witnessed this robbery or has any information that can help us with our enquiries to get in contact with police as soon as possible."

Anyone with information should contact police on 101, quoting incident number 1821 of 26/03/2020.

Reports can also be made anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
