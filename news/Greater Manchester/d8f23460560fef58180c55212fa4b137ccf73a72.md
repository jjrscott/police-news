Over Â£800,000 worth of suspected drugs have been seized by officers, following their discovery in a vehicle in Heywood.

Officers were called around 10:45am this morning (Monday 8 March 2021) to Hareshill Road, where approximately 28kgs of suspected drugs were found.

Officers are currently in attendance and enquiries are ongoing.

A 39-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A controlled drugs. He remains in custody for questioning.

Detective Inspector Karl Ward of GMP's Rochdale District said: "Today's result displays the importance of communities working alongside police to disrupt and dismantle the drugs supply chain."

"With the public's help, alongside our hard-working officers, we can continue to remove illegal drugs from our streets."
