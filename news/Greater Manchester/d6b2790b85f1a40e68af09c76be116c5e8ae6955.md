There was a planned upgrade to GMP's computer system, PoliceWorks, yesterday, which unfortunately on implementation identified some data inputting system errors. However, we have robust contingency plans in place that are being successfully executed across the force, to minimise this disruption.

Officers remain able to view all information in the system and contingency plans are in place for the capture of all data while the situation is being resolved. Part of this plan includes officers using paper to record data, and although this does create a slight delay, we are managing that risk.

There is no impact to ControlWorks or our response to calls from members of the public and we still have the ability to read all information on PoliceWorks. This means there is minimal impact to the service we provide to the public.

We have proactively liaised with partners and have procedures in place to manage high risk incidents, incidents regarding vulnerable people and the management of key intelligence.

We are working closely with our suppliers and are reviewing all options in recovering the system and getting back to business as usual as quickly as possible.
