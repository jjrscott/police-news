Officers are appealing for witnesses after a motorcyclist was seriously injured following a road traffic collision in Rochdale.

Shortly after 4.15pm yesterday (23 September 2020), officers were called to a report of a road traffic collision on Rochdale Road involving a van and a motorcycle.

A white and black Honda CBR motorcycle was travelling along the road in the direction of Middleton when it collided with a white Peugeot Expert van near the junction close to Hopwood Hall College.

A man in his 30s was taken to hospital by air ambulance, where he remains in a critical condition.

Sergeant Andrew Page of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "Our thoughts remain with the family of the man who currently remains in critical condition in hospital.

"It's absolutely vital that anyone who may have information or may have seen anything should come forward.

"Anyone that has dashcam footage or saw either of the vehicles prior to the collision should get in touch by calling 0161 856 4741 quoting log 1886 of 23/09/2020.

"Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
