Detectives are appealing for information following a street robbery in Trafford.

At around 9.30pm on Saturday 31 October 2020, a couple were walking down Ashley Road onto Stamford Road when they were approached by a vehicle by Springbank Park, Hale.

Three masked males armed with baseballs bats got out a vehicle and demanded the couple's jewellery and watch.

The group, who were wearing dark clothing and balaclavas, made off with a high value watch in a vehicle towards Langham Road and Marlborough Road.

Detective Constable Natalie Brine, from GMP's Trafford CID, said: "This was a horrifying ordeal for a couple who were simply walking down the road.

"Although no one was injured, they were both left understandably shaken.

"Enquiries are on-going but any information the public may have could help us with our investigation.

"Anyone who was walking or driving in the area around these times may have information. Any witnesses are asked to call 0161 856 7752 or email NatalieX.Brine@gmp.police.uk.

"Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."

 * _Keep your valuables safe and out of sight_
 * _Stick to well-lit, busy streets and avoid shortcuts which take you through unlit and deserted areas_
 * _Plan your journey. When travelling by public transport, visit journey planner attfgm.com_
