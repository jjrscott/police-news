Donald McPherson (27/06/73) of no fixed abode has been charged with the murder of Paula Leeson, who was 47-years-old at the time of her death. He has been remanded and will appear at Manchester Crown Court on Wednesday 22 April 2020.

On Tuesday 6 June 2017, Danish Authorities were called to reports that a woman had drowned whilst on holiday at an address on Sondervang, Norre Nebel in Denmark.

Emergency services attended and sadly pronounced that Paula had passed away.

This charge has come following a joint investigation between the Danish Authorities and GMP.
