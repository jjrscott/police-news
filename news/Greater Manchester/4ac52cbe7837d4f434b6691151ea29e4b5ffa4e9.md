Appeal 04

Police are appealing for information after an attempted rape in Rusholme.

Shortly before 4.30am this morning (Tuesday 21 July 2020) a woman aged 27 was approached by a man riding a bicycle on a path leading from Aspinall Street to Hibbert Street.

The man then attempted to rape her.

The woman fought off the man and was able to flag down a passing police patrol a short time later.

The offender is described as mixed-race, aged approximately 18-20 and was wearing a light grey hooded tracksuit top with the hood up and matching bottoms.

He was riding a dark-coloured mountain bike.

Detective Inspector Stuart Woodhead of GMP's City of Manchester Division said: "This woman has gone through a terrifying ordeal.

"She is being cared for by specialist officers as our enquiries continue.

"While this incident happened in the early hours, it was in a well-populated area and we have a good description of the offender.

"Were you in the area at the time? Perhaps you saw someone shortly before or after the time of the attack matching the description - perhaps in possession of a bicycle.

"Anyone with CCTV or dashcam or any information should contact police immediately."

Call police on 0161 856 4409 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
