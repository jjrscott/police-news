Did you witness a collision on Church Street in Bolton?

At around 9am on Wednesday 2 October 2019, police were called to Church Street at the junction with Thomas Street, to reports of a collision involving a blue Honda CRV and a single deck bus which was travelling in the direction of Westhoughton Town Centre.

A 78-year-old man - who was making his way to a seat on the bus at the time of the collision - suffered a serious head injury. He was taken to hospital where he sadly passed away three days later.

PC Neil Dalley, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "This was a tragic incident and our thoughts are with the man's family at this dreadful time.

"If you were in the area at this time and saw the collision or have any dash cam footage that could assist our enquiries then please get in touch.

"I'm also particularly keen to speak to anyone who may have been travelling on the bus at the time of the collision. If you've not yet spoken to us please come forward as you may hold vital information."

Information can be left by calling police on 0161 856 4741 quoting incident number 723 of 2/10/19.

Alternatively, information can be left with the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111
