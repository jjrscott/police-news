Did you witness an assault in Oldham?

At around 6:30am on Monday 6 July 2020, police were called to reports of an assault at Alexandra Park in Oldham.

A woman - aged in her 20's - was walking through the park when a man ran up behind her and pulled her to the ground.

The victim suffered minor facial injuries which required hospital treatment.

The offender is described as an Asian man aged in his early 20s and of a slim build. He is around 5ft 3ins tall and at the time of the incident he was wearing dark clothing and a black, padded coat with a hood.
