Shortly before 1am on Sunday 10 November 2019, police were called to reports that a 47-year-old man had been found unconscious on Whitworth Street in the City Centre.

Enquiries have since established that on Chepstow Street at around 9:30pm on Saturday 9 November 2019, the victim was assaulted by three men.

Following the assault, the offenders fled onto Oxford Road walking towards the City Centre.

Two of the offenders are described as wearing dark hooded tops, and the third is described as wearing a white hooded top. All of the offenders were carrying rucksacks.

A short while later at around 9:40pm the victim walked to McDonalds on Oxford Road where three people helped to treat his wounds.

At 12:30am the victim was found collapsed on Whitworth Street by three men who alerted the emergency services.

The victim was taken to hospital with serious head injuries where he remains in a stable but critical condition.

Enquiries are still ongoing.

Detective Inspector Mark Astbury, of GMPs City of Manchester Division, said: "This was a violent attack which has left a man suffering from serious injuries.

"We are particularly keen to speak to anyone that was on Chepstow Street at the time of the incident and may have seen anything suspicious, as well as anyone who may have assisted the victim on Whitworth Street."
