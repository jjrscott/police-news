Police are appealing to the public for information following a firearm discharge in Cheadle on Wednesday 18 March 2020.

Officers were called at around 9.45pm to reports that three windows of an address on Barcheston Road had been smashed.

Initial enquiries have established that a window, door and a black taxi had been damaged as a result of the discharge, but no injuries have been reported.

It is believed the offender made off on a white off-road motorcycle.

No arrests have been made and an investigation is underway.

Detective Sergeant Lisa McGrane, of GMP's Stockport division, said: "This was a frightening incident for local people who were in the vicinity of the address when this incident took place; however, we are confident this is an isolated incident and there is no further risk to the general public.

"We are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed a man around this area of Cheadle on a white off-road motorcycle on the evening of Wednesday 18 March 2020 to come forward and assist with our enquiries.

"If there is anyone who may have been driving around the area that night and recalls seeing a bike of this description, I urge you to check any dash cam footage you may have and to contact police as this information could prove very important to our investigation."

Anyone with any information should contact police on 0161 856 7996 quoting incident number 2788 of 18/03/2020. Details can also be passed anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
