Family of Emanuel Simon pays tribute to him

Emanuel Gabriel Simon, aged 33, was taken to hospital following the incident at around 5.15am on Sunday 26 January 2020.

Despite the best efforts of medical staff, Emanuel sadly died on Tuesday 11 February 2020.

Paying tribute to Emanuel, his family said: "Emanuel came over to the UK in 2008 from Eritrea, east Africa. He had big dreams and aspirations to be a doctor and studied medicine at Manchester University.

"He worked hard while balancing both his job and his studies and after taking a gap year he had been accepted to join a university in Leeds to continue his studies in medicine.

"Known to his family and friends as Paulos, Emanuel was a gentle giant, easy going, quick to smile and loved life - he was dearly loved.

"Being one of nine siblings, Emanuel was from a large family and his loss will have a huge impact on every one of his friends and family.

"Emanuel was taken far too soon and in such tragic circumstances. He will be missed more than words can say."
