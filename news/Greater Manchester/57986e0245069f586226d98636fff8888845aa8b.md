A man has been arrested after a firearms discharge in Gorton.

A 34-year-old man has been arrested following a firearms discharge at Gorton Cemetery on Thornwood Avenue in the evening of Thursday 23 April 2020.

Police were called shortly before 7pm to reports of gunshot sounds following several gatherings in relation to a funeral service that had taken place at the cemetery earlier that afternoon.

Officers attended and found a man nearby on Waterhouse Road who had suffered minor knife wounds. He was taken to hospital and was later arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.

He has since been discharged from hospital and has been remanded in custody to be questioned by detectives.

Evidence of a firearms discharge has been retrieved and a scene remains in place while enquiries continue.

No other injuries have been reported and an investigation is underway.

Senior Investigating Officer Detective Inspector Claire Moss, of GMP's City of Manchester division, said: "Whilst we currently have a man in custody I want to make it very clear that our investigation does not stop here. We are progressing a variety of forensic and CCTV opportunities to make sure that those responsible are brought to justice.

"I would appeal to anyone who has any information to please get in touch and help us, as even the smallest detail can assist our enquiries."

Anyone with information about the incident is encouraged to contact police on 0161 856 1146 or 101, quoting incident number 2455 of 23/04/20. Reports can also be made anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
