Detectives are appealing for more information after a woman was seriously injured following a collision in Sale.

At around 2.35pm on Tuesday 4 February 2020 police were called to a collision involving a pedestrian and a HGV lorry on Washway Road at the junction with Sibson Road in Sale.

An 84-year-old woman was taken to hospital with severe injuries, where she remains in a serious but stable condition.

Washway road was closed yesterday in the direction of Altrincham for several hours.

Police enquiries are ongoing and no arrests have been made.

Sergeant Brian Orr of the Serious Collision Investigation Unit said: "This was a tragic incident which has left a woman fighting for her life in hospital with serious injuries.

"Our thoughts are with her and her family during this devastating time and our officers are working hard to find out more details about what happened before, during and after the collision.

"We are asking anyone who was on or around Washway Road or Sibson Road at the time of the incident and has any dash cam footage or CCTV to please contact police as a matter of urgency. Any information no matter how small could prove invaluable in our search for more evidence."

Anyone with dashcam or CCTV footage should contact police on 0161 856 4741 quoting incident number 1709 of 04/02/2020, or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
