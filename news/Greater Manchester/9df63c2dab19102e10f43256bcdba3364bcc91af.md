"We are working meticulously to establish the details surrounding this event and we are continuing our investigation to ensure we bring those responsible to justice.

"I would like to reassure the local community that we believe there is no further threat to the public but extra high-visibility police patrols will be present in the coming days to ensure the safety of those in the area."
