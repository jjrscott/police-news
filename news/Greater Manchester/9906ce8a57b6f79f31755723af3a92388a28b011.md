A man has died following a collision in Bolton this morning.

At around 3.45am today (Tuesday 28 April 2020) police were called to a report of concern for the welfare of a man on Chorley Old Road in Bolton.

Moments later police were informed of a collision between a pedestrian and a white Citroen Relay Van on the same road.

The pedestrian, a man in his 50s, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.

A scene is in place on Chorley Old Road while police carry out enquiries.

Enquires are ongoing and no arrests have been made.

Sergeant Matthew Picton of GMPs Serious Collision Investigation Unit said: "This was a completely tragic incident in which a man has sadly lost his life and we're supporting the man's family at this incredibly difficult time.

"Our officers are now working hard to piece together the circumstances surrounding this collision including the initial concern for welfare call.

"I would urge drivers with dash cam footage or anybody who would have seen this incident on Chorley Old Road or the events prior to the collision that took place in the early hours of this morning to contact police as soon as possible.

"However insignificant you may think your observations may be it could support our investigations and prove vital in our enquiries."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 4741 quoting incident number 292 of 28/04/2020, or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
