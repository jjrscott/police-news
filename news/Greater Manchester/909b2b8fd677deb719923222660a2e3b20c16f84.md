Since Wednesday 22 July GMP officers have received 263 quarantine requests from Border Force regarding individuals who are not responding to self-isolation requirements.

A self-isolation period of 14 days is a requirement of anyone arriving back to the UK after international travel, with the exception of certain countries.

Those that are required to self-isolate may be contacted by Public Health England (PHE) to check they are following the regulations. If there is no response after a number of attempts of trying to make contact, the details of the individual will be referred to the police by Border Force.

Officers at GMP will then visit the address of the individual and will police by the four Es of engaging, explaining, encouraging and, lastly, enforcing. To date GMP has visited 263 individuals and have issued two fixed penalty notices in relation to repeated breaching of the self-isolation regulations.

Superintendent Andrew Sidebotham said: "It's really important for people to self-isolate for the full 14 days when coming back to the UK as it can take this length of time for symptoms of COVID-19 to develop. During this time you could unknowingly pass the virus on to others, even if you don't have symptoms.

"When contacted by PHE please respond as once a case is referred to police, it takes up a number of resources in order to visit the address and make contact with the individual. As well as this officers are putting their health at risk by visiting someone who could potentially be carrying the virus. A risk that is preventable if everyone self-isolates as required."
