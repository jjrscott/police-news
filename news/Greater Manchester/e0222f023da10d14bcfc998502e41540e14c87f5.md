The parents of Lala Kamara - who was tragically murdered in March 2019 - have paid tribute to her.

"This is a tribute to our beautiful daughter Lala, who was taken from us so unexpectedly. Our lives will never be the same again without her, but she will continue to live in all our hearts forever. We are happy to see that justice has been done today and we want to say a huge thank you to Greater Manchester Police and to the investigation team for all their hard work and efforts to this date that's brought us to today's conclusion."
