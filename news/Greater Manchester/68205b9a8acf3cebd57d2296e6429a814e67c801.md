Liam Rowe

On Sunday 9 June 2019, police were made aware of several burglaries and attempted burglaries in the Urmston area within 24 hours.

A number of properties were damaged and items including bicycles and tools were stolen.

An offender was caught on CCTV and neighbourhood officers identified him as Liam Rowe (23/09/87) of Sussex Road, Partington.

Rowe was arrested and two stolen items were recovered from his home.

Rowe pleaded guilty to eight counts of burglary and, today (Friday 6 December 2019), was sentenced at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court to 1 and a half years in prison.

Sergeant Jon Ezard, of GMP's Trafford division, said: "This is good news for Urmston - another criminal off the streets.

"I hope this reassures residents that we do not tolerate this type of behaviour and are committed to tackling crime in their area.

"I'd like to thank the neighbourhood officers who used their local knowledge and worked tirelessly in order to identify Rowe on CCTV and bring him to justice".
