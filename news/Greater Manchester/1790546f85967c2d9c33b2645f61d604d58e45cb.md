Donna Barrow

Shortly before 9pm on Saturday 23 November 2019, police were called to reports of a collision outside the Royal Albert infirmary on Wigan Lane. A 53-year-old woman, who was formally identified as Donna Barrow, sadly died at the scene.

Paying tribute to Donna, her mum (Agnes), dad (Alan) and sister (Lorna) said:

_" Our lives have been torn apart and will never be the same again; we will miss her every day._"

Paying tribute to Donna, her husband Howard said:

_" I am truly devastated over what has happened to my darling wife. I cannot believe the hurt that has been forced upon me due to these awful circumstances. Such a tragic loss at such a young age. My whole world is broken. I have lots of fond memories of us together and I will miss her forever. Rest in peace, Donna. God Bless." _

A 34-year-old man has been charged in connection to the collision.
