Police are appealing for information after a woman was assaulted during one of five burglaries that officers are treating as linked in Bolton.

Between 11.30pm on Friday 15 May 2020 and 2.30am on Saturday 16 May 2020 police were called to five separate burglaries at bungalows in the Astley Bridge, Sharples and Egerton areas of Bolton.

An offender broke into an address on Bracken Close and two properties on Sharples Hall Fold.

Two other incidents on Stanrose Close, which police believe to be linked, took place at around 2.30am on Saturday 16 May 2020. On this occasion a woman in her 70s was attacked by a man who broke into her home as she tried to make him leave.

Her injuries were minor and did not require hospital treatment.

Several items were stolen from the properties including a purse, wallet, money, food and drink.

No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing.

The offender is described as a white man wearing dark clothing, black trousers, a black face covering, a black duffel coat and gloves.

Inspector Nicola Williams from GMP's Bolton District said: "It is clear this offender has callously targeted residences occupied by vulnerable elderly victims.

"These crimes have left innocent victims frightened of being in their own homes. I would urge anyone who has any information that could assist us in finding the person responsible to contact the police immediately.

"I would also like to reassure the community that we are doing all we can to protect residents and find those responsible.

"I have a dedicated team of officers investigating these incidents and you will see extra patrols in these areas over the coming days and weeks. Please stay vigilant and report anything suspicious to the police."

Anyone with Information is urged to contact police on 0161 856 5761 or email boltonnorth@gmp.police.uk.

Alternatively, information can be passed on to the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
