A 16-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and is currently in custody following the stabbing of a 17-year-old boy in the Edgeley area on Friday 13 December.

Officers were called shortly before 9.10pm on Friday 13 December to reports of a stabbing on Wood Street.

Emergency services attended and a 17-year-old boy was taken to hospital for treatment to stab wounds suffered. He remains in hospital in a stable condition.

Detective Inspector Julia Bowden, of GMP's Stockport division, said: "This incident is a serious violation of conduct on our streets and despite the victim suffering serious injuries, there is an element of fortune that it didn't result in anything more significant.

"We would like to thank the public for their cooperation since our appeal for information at the weekend to support our investigation.

"We hope this arrest serves as a stark warning to those who use and possess bladed articles on our streets that it will not be tolerated and we are determined that those who fail to comply will face the full force of the law."

Anyone with any information about this incident should contact police on 0161 856 9923 quoting incident number 2807 of 13/12/2019.

Information can also be passed on anonymously by calling the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
