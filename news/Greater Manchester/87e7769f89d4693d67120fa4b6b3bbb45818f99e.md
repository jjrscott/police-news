Tribute paid to Kimberley McAssey

The family of a woman who died in Prestwich have paid tribute to her.

Officers were called around 12.15pm to Sherbourne Court, Prestwich to a report of the sudden death of a woman.

Emergency services attended and a 29-year-old woman - who has since been formally identified as Kimberley McAssey - was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

Paying tribute to Kimberley, her family said: "Kimberley was a loving mother, daughter, granddaughter, sister, auntie, niece, friend and colleague.

"She was the life and soul of the party and always got up dancing. She loved going out for walks and jogging with friends.

"There was never a dull moment with her around."

A full investigation into her death has been launched and enquiries are ongoing.

A 30-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder. He remains in custody for questioning.

Officers are continuing to appeal for anyone with information to come forward and speak with police.
