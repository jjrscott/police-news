Officers investigating the murder of a 48-year-old woman in Wigan on Thursday 6 August 2020 arrested a 48-year-old man on suspicion of murder, before releasing him under investigation.

He later became unwell and was admitted to hospital, where he sadly died on the afternoon of Monday 10 August 2020.

Investigators are continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding the woman's death and are committed to ensuring that enquiries continue.

Detective Inspector Neil Lawless, of GMP's Wigan CID, said: "While this case has taken another tragic turn, we are entirely focussed on ensuring that all remaining lines of enquiry are exhausted and that the victim's loved ones are given the answers they need before this investigation reaches its conclusion.

"We remain open-minded as to how this incident came to be and we still await the results of medical examinations following the woman's death that will hopefully give us a clearer indication of what has happened.

"We also ask the public to ensure that they provide us with any information that could aid our investigation; no matter how significant or small they make think it could be, so that we can provide the woman's family with the answers they deserve."

Anyone with information should call police on 0161 856 7182 quoting incident number 3682 of 06/08/2020. Details can also be passed anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
