Police investigating a brutal, unprovoked attack on a man in Eccles have released CCTV footage of two men they would like to speak to in connection with the incident.

At around 5:56pm on Sunday 3 May 2020 police were called to a report of an assault at St Michaels Social Club on Liverpool Road.

A man in his 50s was taken to hospital after he was punched and kicked to the head which knocked him unconscious.

The victim is recovering in hospital after he required extensive treatment for a fractured cheekbone and severe bruising to his face and body.

Detective Constable Stefani Matthews of GMP's Salford District said: "This was a brutal and senseless attack which has left a man in hospital with serious injuries.

"We have released CCTV footage of two men we would like to speak to in connection with the incident and we want anyone who may have information to contact police as soon as possible.

"I ask anyone who believes they were near the social club on Liverpool Road at the time of the assault to try and think back to that evening and recall whether they recognise the car or the men in the video so we can establish the full details of the attack."

Anyone with any information about the assault should contact police on 0161 856 5351 quoting incident number 1965 of 03/05/20.

Information can be passed on anonymously by calling the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
