Police are appealing for information following a fatal collision in Oldham.

Police were called at 8.15am this morning (Tuesday 26 November 2019) following a collision between a silver BMW estate and a pedestrian on Park Road.

A boy, believed to be aged 14, was taken to hospital but sadly later pronounced dead.

A woman aged 42 has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.

Road closures were in place at the junctions of Woodstock Street and Kings Road. Roads have now reopened.

Enquiries are ongoing.

Chief Inspector Nicola De Maine of GMP's Oldham District said: "This is a tragic and very sad incident. Our thoughts are with the boy's family at this dreadful time.

"Specialist officers are supporting them while we investigate the circumstances surrounding the collision.

"If you were in the area at the time and witnessed the collision, or have any details that can assist our investigations, please call police."
