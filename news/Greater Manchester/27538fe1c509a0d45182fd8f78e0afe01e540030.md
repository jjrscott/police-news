The boy, who is aged 14 and cannot be named for legal reasons, has been charged with one count of section 39 assault and will appear at Tameside Youth Court on Tuesday 7 April 2020.

Officers were called shortly before 8.30pm on Tuesday 17 March 2020 to a report that earlier that evening a boy had been coughing and shouting 'Coronavirus' at a woman in Ashton-under-Lyne town centre.

A 14-year-old boy was later arrested on suspicion of section 39 assault.
