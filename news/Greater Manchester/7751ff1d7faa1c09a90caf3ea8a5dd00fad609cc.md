A man has been charged with the murder of Alexander John Soyoye.

Brent Tchipenda (13/10/2002), of Wistaria Road, Manchester has been charged with one count of murder and one count of violent disorder.

He appeared at Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court this morning (Wednesday 11 November 2020) and has been further remanded into custody.

Just after 7pm on Thursday 5 November 2020, police were called to reports of a disturbance on Birchenall Street, Moston.

Officers attended and established that a 16-year-old boy had been stabbed.

Despite the best efforts of emergency services he was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

He has since been formally identified as Alexander John Soyoye.

Specialist officers are continuing to support his family.
