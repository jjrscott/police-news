A man is in police custody after a woman was raped along the North Manchester canal.

On Saturday 11 July 2020, a report was made to police that a woman had been raped on Friday 10 July 2020 at around 7.30pm.

An investigation is in its early stages, but so far enquiries suggest that the victim - a 41-year-old woman - was raped in a wooded area, which is accessed by a footpath, near to the canal path.

It is believed the offender followed the victim for around 15 minutes as she walked along the canal path near to Morrisons supermarket in Failsworth.

The rape occurred on the canal on the border between Failsworth and North Manchester.

The woman is continuing to be supported by specially trained officers and support services.

A 32-year-old man has since been arrested on suspicion of rape. He remains in custody for questioning.

Detective Sergeant Emma Hulston said: "Our enquiries are very much continuing into this horrifying attack and I am pleased to say that we have made an arrest, and that detectives will interview the suspect later today.

"All of our thoughts are still very much with the victim as she begins to come to terms with this ordeal and we, alongside specialist partners and agencies, will continue to support her in any way we can. Nobody should have to go through what she has gone through and we will do our absolute utmost to seek justice on her behalf."

Anyone with information should call police on 0161 8563 639, quoting incident 3074 of 11/07/20. Reports can also be made anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
