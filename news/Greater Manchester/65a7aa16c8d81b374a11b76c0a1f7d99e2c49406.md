The first assault took place at around 8:30 pm on Friday 20 September 2019, at the entrance of Walshaw Park on Sycamore Road, which saw a man - aged 31 - punched and kicked by a large group of males.

The second assault occurred at around 9 pm on Bury Road, close to the junction with Tottington Road in Tottington, where the same man from the first incident was further assaulted by being punched and repeatedly kicked and stamped on the head. A second victim - a boy aged 17 - was punched repeatedly.

The victim who was attacked twice, required hospital treatment after they suffered a fractured jaw, a black eye and bruising around the face and body.

The second victim received bruising to his body.

The offenders from both assaults are suspected to be the same group.
