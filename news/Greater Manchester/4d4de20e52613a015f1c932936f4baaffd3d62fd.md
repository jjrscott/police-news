A woman is fighting for her life after a collision in Cheetham Hill.

Shortly before 11.40am today (Thursday 5 September 2019), police were called to reports that a white Vauxhall Vivaro had collided with a pedestrian on Woodlands Road.

The pedestrian - a 25-year-old woman - was taken to hospital with life threatening head injuries.

The driver of the Vauxhall remained at the scene to speak with officers and no arrests have been made.

The cordon has now been lifted and enquiries are ongoing.

Police Constable Philip Shaw, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "A young woman has been left in a critical condition as a result of this collision.

"Woodlands Road was closed at the junctions with Cardinall Street and Greenhill Road earlier today whilst investigative work was carried out as we're working hard to piece together the circumstances surrounding this incident. Whilst the road has since reopened, our enquiries are still ongoing.

"The collision happened at a relatively busy time of day so I would encourage any witnesses or anyone with information to get in touch as soon as possible."

Anyone with information should call GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 0161 856 4741 or 101 quoting incident number 1008 of 05/09/2019, or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
