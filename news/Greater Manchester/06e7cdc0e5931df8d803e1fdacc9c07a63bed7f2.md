Shortly after 9pm on Wednesday 19 August 2020, police were called to reports of a collision between a grey Mercedes-Benz A Class A45 and a tree on Radcliffe Moor Road.

Emergency services attended and a 27-year-old man was taken to hospital with serious head and chest injuries. Despite the best efforts of medical staff, he was sadly pronounced dead a short while later.

No arrests have been made and enquiries remain ongoing.

"This is a busy stretch of road, and I am hopeful that a number of people may have witnessed this collision and have dash cam footage or information that can help us to complete our investigation.

"If this is you, please do not hesitate to get in touch with police as soon as possible."
