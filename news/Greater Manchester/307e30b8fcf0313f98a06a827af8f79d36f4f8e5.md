Antonia St Louis

The family of a woman who died following a collision in Ashton-Under-Lyne have paid tribute to her.

Shortly after 3.35am on Saturday 28th November, police were called to reports that a red Volkswagen Golf had collided with two pedestrians on Manchester Road, near to Snipe Retail Park.

Emergency services attended and sadly - 27-year-old Antonia St Louis - was pronounced dead at the scene.

A 28-year-old man was taken to hospital where he remains in a critical condition.

A 31-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of causing death whilst driving without due care and attention. He has since been released under investigation.

Enquiries are ongoing.

Antonia's family said: "Antonia was a loving daughter, sister and granddaughter.

"She was a loyal friend and loved by many.

"She had a huge personality and lust for life and added sunshine to many lives. She will be missed and in our hearts forever - this world will be a little darker without her."
