Kathleen Dean (16/08/1962) of Townsley Grove, Ashton was sentenced yesterday (Tuesday 3 November 2020) at Minshull Street Crown Court to four years in jail and received a lifelong restraining order against the victim after pleading guilty to Section 20 assault.

Shortly before 11pm on Sunday 17 November 2019, police were called to reports that a man had been stabbed at an address on Townsley Grove in Ashton-Under-Lyne.

When police arrived they discovered that a man had been stabbed in the thigh and located a kitchen knife which was discarded behind the sofa.

Enquiries have established that after the man was stabbed, he managed to lock himself in the kitchen where he phoned the police.

Detective Constable Natalie Fairhurst, of GMP's Tameside district, said: "This was a vicious assault and it's lucky that the outcome was not much worse. Dean used a kitchen knife as a weapon which is truly horrific and brutal.

"Dean is a dangerous individual and I hope that today's sentence sends a clear message that this type of violent behaviour will not be tolerated, and gives Dean the time she needs to reflect on the impact of her actions."
