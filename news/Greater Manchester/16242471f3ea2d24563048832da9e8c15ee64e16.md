Police are appealing for the public's help to trace three wanted men from Manchester.

Mohammed Sadigh (13/01/1992), Hamza Badawi (10/04/1998) and Zuhir Nassrat (27/05/1998), are wanted in connection with conspiracy to supply class A drugs between January 2017 and December 2020 in Manchester.

They are believed to have links to the Moss Side and Rusholme areas.

Anyone with information on the Sadigh, Badawi and Nassrat's whereabouts is asked to contact police on 0161 856 4273 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
