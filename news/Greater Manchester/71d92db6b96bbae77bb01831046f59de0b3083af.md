Police are appealing for information after an assault in Wigan.

Shortly after 8.15pm on Sunday 20 October 2019 police were called by the ambulance service to a report of a man assaulted on Battersby Street, Ince.

Emergency services attended and a 64-year-old man was tended to by paramedics but did not require hospital treatment.

It is believed the man was assaulted by a man while walking his dog on a dismantled railway track behind Battersby Street when he was heading towards Morrison's supermarket near Hindley.

The offender is described as a white man, in his mid-30s, of large build, around 6ft with a shaved head, wearing a blue t-shirt. Police believe he was in the company of two children when the assault occurred.

No arrests have been made and enquiries are on-going.

Constable Sean Goddard of the Wigan division said: "This was a violent attack on a defenceless man who was left understandably shaken.

"We are particularly keen to speak to anyone that was on or around Battersby Street at the time of the incident and may have heard or seen anything suspicious.

"I would also like to reassure the community that we are doing all we can to find the man responsible."

Anybody with information should contact police on 0161 856 7124, quoting incident number 2952 of 20/10/2019, or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
