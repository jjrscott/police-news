Police want to speak to this man

Officers were called at around 9am on Thursday 12 March 2020 to reports that a man purporting to be a police officer had threatened a staff member with a knife and demanded cash at a post office on Stretford Road in the Hulme area of the city.

The offender is believed to have fled on foot towards Old Birley Street and Stretford Road with a large amount of cash.

No injuries were reported and no arrests have been made.

Enquiries are ongoing and police are appealing to the public with any information to come forward.

Detective Sergeant Mark Anderson, of GMP's City of Manchester division, said: "This was a traumatising incident for an innocent staff member who thought he was respectably complying with the request of a genuine police officer before realising the situation was something far more sinister.

"We have released images of a man we are interested in speaking to in connection with this incident and appeal to him to come and contact police as part of our enquiries.

"I also encourage anyone with information that could aid our investigation to come forward to ensure that the man who conned this innocent worker will ultimately face the consequences."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 4409 quoting incident number 764 of 12/03/2020. Details can also be passed to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
