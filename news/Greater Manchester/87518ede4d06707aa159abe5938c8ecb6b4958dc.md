Police are appealing for information after an elderly cyclist was seriously injured in Timperley.

At around 11.50am on Sunday 31 May 2020, police were called to a report that a cyclist was lying injured on Thorley Lane in Timperley.

The cyclist - a man in his 80s - was taken to hospital with serious injuries. He remains there in a stable condition.

Officers are investigating the cause of the incident.

No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing.

Sergeant Matthew Picton, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "This was a tragic incident where a man in his 80's has suffered serious injuries as a result of this collision and we're working hard to piece together the circumstances that led to the man coming off his bike.

"My thoughts are with the gentleman and his family. I would appeal to anyone who has any dashcam footage or who witnessed the incident on Thorley Lane on the morning of Sunday 31 May 2020 to please contact us.

"Any information you may have could be invaluable and really help with our enquiries."

Anyone with any information should call police on 0161 856 4740 quoting incident number 1408 of 31/05/2020. Details can also be passed anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
