A man and woman have been charged after the execution of warrants this morning (Thursday 14 January) by officers from Operation Haemus.

Hemen Mohammed Ali (23/04/1992) - also known as Hazhar Anwar - of Redfield Close, Beswick, has been charged with five offences including: possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear and violence; conspiring to cause grievous bodily harm with intent; possession with intent to supply controlled drugs, namely cocaine; concerned in the supply of class A drugs, namely cocaine, and concerned in the supply of class A drugs, namely heroin.

Zain Sarfraz (04/12/1991), of Hyde Park Road, Halifax, has been charged with one count of perverting the course of justice.

Both have been remanded in custody and are due to appear at Manchester and Salford Magistrates' court tomorrow (Friday 15 January 2021).

On Friday 15 November 2019, two men - aged 20 and 18 - were seriously injured after suffering gunshot wounds to the leg on Copthall Lane in Cheetham Hill.

The incident prompted the formation of GMP's dedicated response - Operation Haemus.
