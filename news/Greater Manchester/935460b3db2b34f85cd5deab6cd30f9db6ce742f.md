A murder investigation has been launched in Bury.

Officers were called around 12.15pm today (Sunday 21 February 2021) to Sherbourne Court, Prestwich to a report of the sudden death of a woman.

Emergency services attended and a 29-year-old woman was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

An investigation has been launched and enquiries are ongoing.

A 30-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder. He remains in custody for questioning.

Chief Inspector, Kate Atton of GMP's Bury division, said: "A woman has very tragically lost her life and our thoughts are very much with her family at this desperately sad time. We currently have specialist officers supporting them.

"Our investigation is in its initial stages and we're dedicated to ensuring we provide her family with the answers that they deserve.

"Although we have one man in custody I would urge anyone who may have any information relating to this death to get in touch with police immediately. Any information, no matter how small could be crucial to our investigation."
