Detectives are appealing for witnesses following a stabbing in Manchester that has left two men with serious injuries.

Just before 11.45pm on Tuesday 10 November 2020, officers were called to a report of a stabbing outside of a flat block on The Fold in Blackley, Manchester.

Enquiries have established that two men - aged 18 and 20 - were stabbed outside the entrance to the flats by two men dressed in balaclavas, dark clothing and wielding machetes.

Emergency services attended and the 20-year-old man was taken to hospital with serious injuries to his head, arms and legs.

The 18-year-old man had left the scene prior to emergency service arrival and self-presented a short time later at hospital with serious injuries to his head and back.

No arrests have been made and enquiries remain ongoing.

Detective Inspector Louise Edwards, of GMP's City of Manchester division, said: "This was a vicious assault in which two men have suffered serious injuries after being attacked and stabbed.

"I understand the nearby residents may be concerned about this incident but I want to assure the community that our investigation is very much on-going to find those responsible and bring them to justice.

"Anyone who may have seen anything, or has any information at all, is urged to contact police. Even the smallest amount of information could prove vital in helping us to complete our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to call 0161 856 1146 quoting log 3109 of 10/11/20.

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
