Thousands of pounds worth of Class A drugs, cash, and a suspected firearm have been recovered during raids across Manchester this morning.
​
At around 5am this morning (Thursday 25 March) Officers from GMP's City of Manchester Division, the Intelligence Development Unit, Operation Challenger and the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit, executed warrants as part of Operation Apostle, at five addresses across the city.

During the Operation, five men, aged between 23 and 59 were arrested on suspicion of drugs and firearms offences, and money laundering offences, and they remain in custody for questioning.

During searches of the properties, Class A drugs were recovered believed to be worth around £10,000, along with £2,000 worth of cash, and a suspected firearm.

This morning's activity forms part of an investigation into organised crime, possession of firearms and drug dealing in the Hulme, Moss Side and Manchester area.

Chief Inspector John Harris of GMP's City of Manchester Division, said "The early morning police activity today has been the culmination of a great team effort. Over a period of time officers have been gathering intelligence and evidence, leading to the activity today where we have been able to continue to enforce, intervene and tackle organised crime in Hulme, Moss Side and the wider Manchester area.

Today we have been able to recover a potentially lethal weapon, a significant quantity of drugs, and an amount of cash. This is another positive step forward in our commitment to ensuring the community are kept safe and that the risk of harm is reduced.

"A lot of unseen work has gone into the preparation of today's activity to disrupt and dismantle organised criminal activity, and our investigations will continue. Officers often rely on the intelligence and information received from members of the community, so I would encourage anyone with any information or concern to contact the police, whether in person, by telephone on 0161 856 4428, online www.gmp.police.uk or anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
