Steven Norman Mackie (30/10/1966), of Stamford Street, Stalybridge, has been charged with one count of failing to maintain public health and causing public disorder and nuisance contrary to regulations 6, 9(1b and 4) of the Health Protection Regulations 2020.

He is due to appear at Tameside Magistrates' Court on Monday 30 March 2020.

This is in relation to a reported incident that took place on Saturday 28 March 2020 and saw a man unnecessarily out of his home and approaching members of the public in a queue outside a Tesco store in Stalybridge.

Officers advised the man about his conduct but he continued to approach people contrary to social distancing rules and government guidelines on the restriction of movement during the emergency period.
