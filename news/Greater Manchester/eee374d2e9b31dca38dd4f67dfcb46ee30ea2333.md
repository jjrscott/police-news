Police are appealing for information following a serious collision in Manchester.

Shortly after 6am on Sunday 5 January 2020 a silver BMW was travelling in a north east direction along Rochdale Road (A664) when it mounted the pavement and collided with a lamp post.

The driver of the vehicle, a woman aged 20, was taken to hospital where she remains for treatment of potentially life-threatening injuries.

A male passenger, aged 22, was taken to hospital with serious injuries which are not believed to be life-threatening.

Two female passengers, both aged 22, and a male passenger whose age is currently unknown, were uninjured.

Detective Constable Diana Dyer-Barron of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit said: "Our thoughts are with those who remain in hospital following this collision and we wish them a speedy recovery.

"We are appealing for anyone who has dashcam or CCTV footage of the collision or may have seen the car involved before, during and after the incident to get in touch as soon as possible with any information they may have."

Anyone with more information should contact police on 0161 856 4741 quoting incident number 651 of 05/01/2020, or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
