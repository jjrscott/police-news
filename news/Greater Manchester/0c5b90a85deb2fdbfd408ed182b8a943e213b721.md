Police investigating an incident of voyeurism at a nightclub in Manchester have released an image of a man they want to speak to.

At around 7pm on Friday 31 May 2019 a woman in her 20s was using the toilet at Affleck and Brown on Hilton Street, Manchester.

While in a cubicle, she noticed that a man was peering over the cubicle divider and appearing to film her on a mobile phone.

Police have released an image of a man they want to speak to in relation to the incident.

Constable Callum Taylor of GMP's City of Manchester Division said: "This incident was a gross invasion of the woman's privacy.

"Since it occurred, we have been following various lines of enquiry to trace the offender.

"We have now released an image of a man we want to speak. Anyone who recognises this individual should contact police immediately."

Anyone with information should call police on 0161 856 4223 quoting incident 2095 of 31/05/19 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
