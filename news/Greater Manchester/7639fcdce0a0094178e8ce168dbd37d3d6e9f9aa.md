Detectives have released an image of a watch that was stolen during a robbery in Trafford yesterday morning (Wednesday 23 September 2020).

Officers were called to a report of a robbery on Winton Road in Bowdon at around 7am.

A woman was confronted by three masked men who gained entry to the address before pinning her down, pulling a Rolex watch off her arm.

The woman was left with minor bruising to her arm.

Detective Constable Steve Matthias, from GMP's Trafford division, said: "The family are understandable very shaken and distressed from this ordeal.

"The woman was attacked by three men in her own home and we're determined to catch those responsible."

"Anyone who may have seen the watch or may have seen it up for sale should also contact us.

"Anyone with information or anyone who may have seen anything suspicious is asked to call 0161 856 7533. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
