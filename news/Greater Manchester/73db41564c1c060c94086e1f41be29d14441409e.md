A man who bit a police officer's arm in an attempt to evade arrest in Rochdale has been jailed for 12 months.

On Wednesday 27 May 2020 Daniel Chipchase (5/10/78) of Cheviot Close, Middleton was sentenced to 12 months custody at Minshull Street Crown Court for a Section 47 assault on a police officer.

The officer was taken to hospital due to how severe his injuries were. He has since been discharged.

Police Constable Daniella Capper of GMP's Rochdale District said: "As police officers we do not come to work and expect to be assaulted. The officer involved was subject to an unprovoked barbaric assault from Chipchase. We hope this result sends a clear message that this type of behaviour towards our officers will not be tolerated on the streets of Manchester and is totally unacceptable."
