Alexander Sinclair

On the evening of Saturday 29 December 2018, the victim was with a group of friends in The Welcome Inn on Bury Old Road.

The prosecution told the court that the victim asked Alexander Sinclair (30/03/1991) of Langley Hall Road, Prestwich to move.

An argument started and a short time later, Sinclair tried to punch the victim with his left hand before smashing a pint glass in to the side of his face with his right hand.

The victim received head and face injuries which required hospital treatment.

Sinclair was later arrested and taken into custody for police interview.

Sinclair denied the offence but following a trial, a jury previously found him guilty of section 18 assault.

Yesterday (Thursday 9 January 2020), Sinclair was sentenced at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court to five years imprisonment.

Detective Constable Donna Haldane, of GMP's Bury division, said: "This was a horrible end to what should have been an enjoyable night for the victim and his friends. The attack was unprovoked and left a man requiring hospital treatment for what were pretty serious injuries. Hopefully today's sentence will give Sinclair time to reflect on his unnecessary and disgraceful actions.

"Greater Manchester Police will not tolerate violence of any kind so we take incidents like this very seriously and I hope this case serves as a warning to anyone who does consider being violent that officers will work tirelessly for as long as it takes to bring offenders to justice".
