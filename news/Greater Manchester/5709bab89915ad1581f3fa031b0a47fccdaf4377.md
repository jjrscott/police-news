Detectives have launched a murder inquiry after a teenager died following a stabbing in Manchester this evening (Thursday 5 November 2020).

Just after 7pm, officers were called by colleagues at the ambulance service to a report of a stabbing on Birchenall Street, Moston.

Despite the best efforts of emergency services, sadly, a 16-year-old boy was pronounced dead at the scene.

At this time, it is believed a number of males armed with weapons were involved in an altercation.

No arrests have been made and an investigation is underway.

A large cordon is in place in the area whilst detectives carry out enquiries.

Detective Superintendent Jamie Daniels, of GMP's City of Manchester district, said: "This is a dreadful incident and we're working hard to establish how this boy came to lose his life.

"A dedicated team of officers are supporting the boy's family and our thoughts are with them as they struggle to come to terms with their loss.

"A full investigation is underway and is very much in its infancy and a number of detectives remain at the scene carrying out enquiries.

"I would urge members of the community to do the right thing and come forward - a number of people may have seen what happened and any piece of information may prove vital for our investigation.

"Anyone who may have seen anything, or has any information at all, should call us on 101 quoting incident number 2639 of 05/11/20.

"Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
