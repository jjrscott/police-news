Assistant Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Nick Bailey said: "Greater Manchester Police is currently working with suppliers to resolve an intermittent problem which is affecting our computer system - iOPS.

"The issue arose following a pre-planned upgrade and has resulted in reduced functionality but has not prevented access to iOPS or critical information.

"This has not impacted the recording of calls from the public or our response to those calls.

"As for all systems, GMP has tried and tested plans in place to minimise disruptions of this kind - including a team of super-users and contingencies which are being successfully executed force wide.

"GMP's priority has always been protecting Greater Manchester and, most importantly, that remains unchanged and unaffected by the ongoing problem.

"Our suppliers will work tirelessly until full functionality is restored. We will be providing regular updates to partner agencies to maintain collaborative working."
