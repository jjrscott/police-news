At around 6.40am on Tuesday 4 August 2020, police were called to reports of a burglary at a residential property on Lansdowne Road, Atherton.

Officers attended and established that the victim had woken up to find a man ransacking her home. He left her outside - injured and shouting for help.

The victim sustained a suspected fracture to her upper leg.

Jewellery, a laptop and cash were stolen.

An investigation is underway.

No arrests have been made.

DC David Law, of GMP's Wigan district, said: "The victim must have been terrified. To be targeted in your own home when you are asleep is understandably frightening.

"Not only did this offender break in to the victim's home and steal sentimental and valuable items but they also left the victim in pain on the floor outside her home.

"We are working hard to identify the person responsible and bring them to justice. I would appeal to anyone with information which may assist us with this to get in touch."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 756 7225 quoting 509 of 04/08/20 or the independent charity - Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
