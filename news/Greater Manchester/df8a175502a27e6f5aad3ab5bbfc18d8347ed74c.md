Shortly before 10pm on Saturday 5 December 2020, police were called to reports of a robbery on Parkside Road in Fallowfield.

Enquiries established that a delivery driver was driving a motor scooter when he was approached by four men who kicked him and pulled him off of his scooter. They proceeded to assault the man before making off on his scooter.

The victim suffered minor facial injuries which did not require hospital treatment.

No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing.

Police Constable Martin Catterall, of GMP's City of Manchester division, said "These men attacked an innocent member of the public who was just trying to do his job, and stole his scooter from him, leaving him understandably shaken and upset.

"We are following all available lines of enquiry to identify these offenders and are releasing this CCTV footage in the hope that someone has information that they can share with police.

"If you witnessed this incident or recognise any of these offenders please come forward as soon as possible."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 6033, quoting incident number 2854 of 5/12/2020.

Reports can also be made anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
