Shortly before 2pm on Sunday 4 October 2020, police were called to Scotsman's Flash in Wigan to reports of a concern for welfare of a man.

Emergency services attended and sadly discovered the body of a man in the water.

Formal identification is yet to take place but he is believed to be an 18-year-old man and his next of kin have been informed.

Two men - aged 18 and 19 - and a 17-year-old boy have been arrested on suspicion of murder. They remain in custody for questioning.

A scene remains in place whilst investigation work is carried out.

Chief Inspector Liz Sanderson, of GMP's Wigan division, said: "This is clearly a devastating incident and one that has left a family understandably shattered. We have officers supporting them through this unimaginably distressing time.

"We have a dedicated team of officers who will be working around the clock on this investigation and whilst we have three people in custody, our enquiries are at a very early stage and we are keeping an open mind.

"We will do all that we can to fully establish the circumstances of the man's death and provide his family with much-needed answers."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 7094 quoting incident number of 1457 of 04/10/19. Reports can also be made anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
