A man has been arrested after live TV footage showed a supporter making racist gestures at the Manchester City v Manchester United match at the Etihad Stadium yesterday.

At around 6.55pm on Saturday 7 December 2019 police were called to a report of a supporter making alleged racist gestures and sounds towards players during the Manchester City and Manchester United derby.

A 41-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order and remains in custody for questioning.

Superintendent Chris Hill of the City of Manchester Division said: "I would like to thank the public for their ongoing support with this incident.

"Racism of any kind has no place in football or our society and I hope this arrest shows that we are taking this matter extremely seriously.

"We will continue to work with Manchester City and Manchester United Football clubs on this incident and will investigate any other lines of enquiries."
