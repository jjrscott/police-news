An investigation is underway after a window was damaged in Salford after a firearms discharge yesterday morning.

Officers were called at around 7.40am on Wednesday 17 March to a report of a firearms discharge on Cholmondeley Road.

Initial enquiries established evidence of a single bullet being fired at the window of a property.

Thankfully, no one was injured.

Investigators believe that there isn't a wider threat to the public and it is not thought to be linked to any known ongoing feud.

It is not yet understood what the exact cause of the incident is, and those enquiries are ongoing.

No arrests have been made and police patrols will be increased in the area for the rest of the week as reassurance for the community.
