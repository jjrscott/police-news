An industrial-sized unit containing a large amount cannabis plants has been uncovered by officers in Salford.

Officers were called just after 11pm last night (16 December 2020) to a report of three men acting suspiciously at an industrial unit on John Street.

On attendance, one man made off from the scene in a vehicle and following a short pursuit, officers arrested a 38-year-old man on suspicion of burglary in east Manchester. Two more men, 20 and 22, were arrested at the scene on suspicion of burglary. Two of the men have been released under investigation pending further enquiries and one remains in custody.

When officers arrived at the premises, a large industrial unit was found fully stocked with a large number of cannabis plants in multiple rooms. A sophisticated filtration system and a large amount of fertiliser was also uncovered.

A 28-year-old man was found by officers in the property and arrested on suspicion of production of cannabis. He remains in custody at this time.

Inspector Eamon McManus, of GMP's Salford district, said: "This is a significant find and fantastic work by our officers who managed to detain all those believed to be involved.

"The property is in the process of being made safe and due to the scale of the find, officers may remain at the scene for a day or two.

"We will continue to bring offenders who blight our communities with drugs to justice. Anyone with any concerns or has any information about drugs in their area can call 101.

"Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
