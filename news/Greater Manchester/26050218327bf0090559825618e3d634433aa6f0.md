Shortly after 3 am on Sunday 15 December 2019, police were called to Blackburn Road, Egerton to reports of a collision involving one car - a black Audi.

Emergency services attended and four men were taken to hospital with serious injuries.

Despite best efforts from paramedics, a 35-year-old man was sadly pronounced dead a short time later.

Three men, two aged 23 and one aged 21, have been treated for serious injuries. They remain in hospital.
