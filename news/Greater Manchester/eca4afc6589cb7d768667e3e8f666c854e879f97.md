A man is currently in hospital with life threatening injuries.

Shortly after 10pm on Friday 20 September, police were called to reports of a collision on Rishton Lane.

A silver Vauxhall Vectra involved in the collision failed to stop at the scene.

Witnesses describe seeing a red VW Golf on Rishton Lane immediately after the collision.

Police Sergeant Andrew Page, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit (SCIU), said: "Firstly my thoughts are with the victim and his family at this time.

"Our officers are working hard to piece together the circumstances surrounding this collision.

"Whilst I would appeal for any witnesses or anyone with information to get in touch, I am particularly keen on tracing the occupants of the red VW Golf. I urge anyone with any information about this collision, no matter how small, to please get in touch.

Anybody with information should contact the Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 0161 856 4741 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
