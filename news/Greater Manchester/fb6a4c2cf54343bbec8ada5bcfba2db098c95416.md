A man is fighting for his life after he was seriously assaulted in Wythenshawe.

Yesterday evening (Thursday 4 June 2020) at around 6pm, police were called to Wythenshawe Road in Wythenshawe to reports that a man had been seriously assaulted.

He has been taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries.

The investigation is in its early stages but enquiries have established that the victim - a man in his 20s - was assaulted by two men.

A 39-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. A 42-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. They both remain in custody for questioning.

Detective Superintendent Jamie Daniels, of GMP's City of Manchester district, said: "Clearly, this was a vicious assault which has left a man in a critical condition and our thoughts are very much with the victim and his loved ones as he fights for his life in hospital.

"Whilst we have two people in custody, the investigation is in its early stages and we are keeping an open mind at the moment. However, we have a dedicated team working incredibly hard to establish the full facts surrounding this incident.

"Officers have already spoken to several witnesses who have described seeing the victim being assaulted by two men - one is described as White and the other is described as Black or mixed race. As I've stressed, we are keeping an open mind and given this I would like to continue to appeal to anyone else who was in the vicinity of the area at the time of the incident - did you see anything suspicious? If so, please get in touch with us as a matter of urgency.

"News like this can be incredibly distressing for those who live in the area and I want to reiterate to you that we are doing all that we can in what is a very fast-moving investigation. There will be a higher police presence throughout the night and in the coming days and I would encourage anyone with concerns to please speak to these officers."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 6198 quoting incident number 2099 of 04/06/20. Reports can also be made anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
