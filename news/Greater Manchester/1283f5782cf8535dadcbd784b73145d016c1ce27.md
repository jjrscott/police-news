A 13-year-old boy - who cannot be named for legal reasons - has been charged with one count of murder and was remanded in custody to appear at Manchester Magistrates' Court earlier today (Friday 14 August 2020).

Shortly before 7.50pm on Thursday 6 August 2020, police were called by the ambulance service to reports of concern for a man outside the church on Bishopgate, Wigan.

Despite the best efforts of emergency services, Steven James McMyler sadly died at the scene.

A 19-year-old man has previously also been charged with murder.

A 17-year-old boy from Merseyside has also since been arrested on suspicion of murder and is in custody for questioning.
