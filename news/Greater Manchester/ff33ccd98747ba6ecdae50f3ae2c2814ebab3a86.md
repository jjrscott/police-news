A man and woman who conspired to sexually abuse young girls have been jailed for 26 years.

Peter Taylor and Keeli Burlingham appeared for sentencing at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court on Friday January 17 2020.

The court previously heard how Taylor and his partner Burlingham abused several young girls and used their phones to film and photograph their victims.

Several phones and a computer were seized from Taylor's address on Friday 6 April 2018 following intelligence received by the police that he was involved in the downloading of indecent images.

Messages on the devices revealed that Taylor had encouraged Burlingham to sexually assault a young girl. Burlingham then carried out the assault and sent indecent images of the girl to Taylor.

Other videos and films that were taken by Taylor and Burlingham of assaults they carried out were also found on their phones and computer.

The pair were found to have abused five children in total.

Peter Taylor (10/08/1986) of Kendal Terrace, Dukinfield was found guilty of the following offences:

 * Arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sex offence
 * Sexual assault of a child under 13
 * Taking indecent photographs of a child
 * Making indecent photographs of a child
 * Intentionally encouraging the commission of an offence
 * Encouraging the commission of an offence believing it to be committed

Taylor was sentenced to 15 years, plus three years extended sentence.

Keeli Burlingham (08/08/1986) of Kendal Terrace, Dukinfield was found guilty of the following offences:

 * Arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sex offence
 * Sexual assault of a child under 13
 * Taking indecent photographs of a child
 * Making indecent photographs of a child
 * Assault of a child under 13 by penetration
 * Distributing indecent photographs of a child

Burlingham was sentenced to 11 years, plus one year extended sentence.

Detective Chief Inspector Judith Holmes of GMP's Public Protection Unit said: "Taylor and Burlingham knew how old their victims were. They have absolutely no excuse for their grossly inappropriate and predatory behaviour towards children.

"This pair subjected innocent children to sickening abuse. Prison is absolutely where they belong. Discussions between the two planning the sexual abuse found on their phones were some of the most appalling conversations I have seen in my career.

"I hope today's result helps the victims and their families move on from what must have been an incredibly traumatic experience.

"This case should highlight just how seriously we take reports of this nature and our absolute commitment to seeking justice for those affected by such heinous acts.

"Please, if you're struggling and need support - we are here to listen."
