Detectives are appealing for witnesses following a stabbing in Rochdale last night (17 December 2020).

Officers were called to a report of an injured male on Tweedale Street in Rochdale at around 7.15pm.

It is believed a teenager was stabbed on the street before he was taken to hospital with serious injuries where he remains.

Road closures were put in place whilst an investigation took place.

Detective Inspector David Crewe, of GMP's Rochdale CID, said: "This incident has left a teenager with serious injuries and is currently receiving medical treatment in hospital and our thoughts are with his family who are understandably worried.

"We want to bring those responsible to justice so we're asking the public to come forward with any information that may be able to assist us.

"Anyone with information or anyone who may have seen anything is asked to call 0161 856 4668 quoting log number 2231 of 16/12/20.

"Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."

GMP is currently supporting the Home Office's Offensive Weapon Surrender scheme which allows lawful owners to hand in weapons to the police and claim compensation, after legislation was put to parliament making them unlawful to own.

The Offensive Weapons Act bans possession of dangerous and offensive weapons in private. The list of weapons includes zombie knives, cyclone knives, knuckledusters, death star knives, flick knives, gravity knives, batons, disguised knives, push daggers and other offensive weapons.
