Detectives have launched an investigation into the death of a woman in the Swinley area of Wigan.

Officers were called at around 11pm on Thursday 6 August 2020 to reports of concern for a woman's welfare at an address on Mesnes Road.

Upon police arrival, the woman - aged 48 - was sadly found deceased at the scene.

A 48-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody for questioning.

Detective Inspector Neil Lawless, of GMP's Wigan CID, said: "Our thoughts are with the family of the woman who was sadly found deceased at her home overnight.

"Our investigation is in its very early stages and while we have one man in custody on suspicion of murder in relation to this incident, it is important we continue to approach this investigation with an open-mind at this time.

"We are still working to establish how the woman passed away and are keen to hear from anyone who may have information that can support our enquires; any information, no matter how small it may seem, could prove to be significant."

Anyone with information should call police on 0161 856 7182 quoting incident number 3682 of 06/08/2020. Details can also be passed anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
