Two men aged 79 and 82 were taken to hospital where they were sadly pronounced dead a short time later.

No arrests have been made and enquiries are still ongoing.

Detective Sergeant Darren Hancock of the Serious Collision Investigation Unit said: "Despite an appeal from officers at the time of this incident for any dashcam footage or witnesses to contact police, we are still investigating what led to this collision and what happened during and after the incident.

"We are asking anyone who witnessed this collision, specifically a woman who assisted at the scene and was driving a light coloured Fiat 500 to contact police.

"We would like the woman to know that she is not in any trouble and ask her to go to any police station or make contact with us as soon as possible."

If you witnessed this collision or believe you are the person mentioned, please contact the Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 0161 856 4741 quoting incident number 2764 of 20/12/2019, or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
