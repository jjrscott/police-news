A picture of a male officers want to speak to in relation to a hate crime assault

At around 12.30pm a man in his 20s was physically assaulted by another man in what is believed to have been an unprovoked attack.

The victim suffered serious facial injuries and required hospital treatment.

Officers have released an image of a man they want to speak to in relation to the incident.

Police Constable Arkadiusz Kosok of GMP's Greater Manchester division, said: "We are appealing for information in relation to this unprovoked attack which has seen an innocent man require hospital treatment for serious facial injuries.

"No one should be subjected to such a terrifying attack motivated by hatred towards minority groups and we are keen to speak to man in the images we have released in connection with the incident.

"We urge the public to get in touch if they think they may know him."

Anyone with any information about the assault should contact police on 101 quoting incident number 1469 of 06/10/19. Details can also be passed on to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
