Last night (Saturday 21 March 2020) at around 10:15pm, officers were called to reports that a firearm had been discharged through the window of a property on Windale, Worsley.

A 65-year-old woman and her three young grandchildren were home at the time.

No one was injured and this is believed to be an isolated incident with no further risk to the public.

No arrests have been made and an investigation is underway.

A police cordon is currently in place on Windale and Hilton Lane while investigation work is carried out.

Inspector Katie Allen of GMP's Salford district, said: "This was an extremely frightening event for all involved, especially as there were young children present at the time.

"I would like to reassure the community that we are doing all we can to protect residents and investigate this incident. Additional high-visibility police patrols will be present in the coming days to ensure the safety of those in the area.

"We are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed anything or has any information about this firearm discharge to get in touch with police as soon as possible. No matter how insignificant you may feel the information is, it could prove vital in helping us with our enquiries."

Anyone with information should contact police on 101, quoting incident number 2894 of 21/03/20.

Reports can also be made anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
