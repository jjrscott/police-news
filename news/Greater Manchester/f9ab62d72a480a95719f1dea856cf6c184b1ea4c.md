Zak Eko (22/08/1997) has been charged with murder.

He has been remanded in custody and will appear at Manchester Magistrates' Court tomorrow, Friday 13 September 2019.

Shortly before 4.25pm yesterday (Wednesday 11 September 2019), police were called to reports that a child was in the River Irwell near to Blackburn Street in Radcliffe.

Emergency services attended and the baby boy was retrieved from the water and taken to hospital.

The boy - who has since been formally identified as 11-month-old Zakari William Bennett-Eko - sadly died a short time later despite the best efforts of paramedics and specialist doctors.
