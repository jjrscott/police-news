Around 8pm on Sunday 27 October, police were called to Rochdale Road in Oldham to reports that a car had collided with a pedestrian and failed to stop.

Emergency services attended and a man in his 20s was taken to hospital with serious injuries to his head and legs.

The man remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition.

Rochdale Road has now been re-opened and enquiries remain ongoing.

Police Sergeant Joseph Barron, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "The failure to stop by this motorist - after causing serious injury to a young man - is absolutely shocking behaviour and shows a complete lack of concern for the welfare of others..

"We are working to establish the circumstances that led to this collision, and I would like to make a direct plea to anyone who may have seen anything that can assist our enquiries.

"I'd ask any witnesses or anyone with any information, dash-cam or CCTV footage of the collision to please get in touch as soon as possible."

Anybody with information should call GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 0161 856 4741, quoting incident number 2877 of 27/10/19.

Reports can also be made anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
