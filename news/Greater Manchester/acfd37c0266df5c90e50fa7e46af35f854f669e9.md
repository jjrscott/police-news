Officers are appealing for information after a 65-year-old woman was robbed on Forest Street in Hathershaw at around 7.15pm on Tuesday 10 December 2019.

A man approached the woman from behind and grabbed her handbag. During the robbery the woman was dragged to the floor which caused bruising to her arms and legs.

The man made off on foot with the victim's handbag which contained her mobile phone, keys, debit cards and cash.

The offender is described as a man around 5ft 2 inches tall, of a slim build. He is around 18 years old and at the time of the incident he was wearing a dark zipped up hoodie and dark coloured jeans.

Police Constable Toby Miskiewicz, of GMPs Oldham division, said: "This criminal behaviour subjected an innocent member of the public to a frightening ordeal which is completely unacceptable.

 "I am keen to speak to anyone who was around the Forest Street area at the time of the incident and may have heard or seen anything unusual or suspicious."

Anyone who has any information about the robbery should call police on 0161 856 8913 quoting incident number 2656 of 10/12/19.

Details can also be passed on anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
