Neil Shaw (17/08/1985), of no fixed abode, has been charged with six robberies, one burglary, and four counts of possession of an offensive weapon and is due to appear at Wigan Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 29 January 2019.

Shortly after 2.30pm on Saturday 11 January 2020, police were called to reports of an armed robbery at Ladbrokes on Spinning Gate.

Three members of the public were walking past when they saw a man armed with a hammer and a wheel brace making threats inside.

They bravely intervened as he tried to flee with a quantity of stolen cash and detained him. One member of the public suffered minor injuries.
