At around 6pm yesterday (Saturday 13 June 2020), police received a report that an Audi A3 had been involved in collision with a KTM 65S Pit Bike at the junction of Surbiton Road and Crayford Road.

Two 14-year-old boys, who were both travelling on the KTM, were thrown from the bike as a result of the collision. Both were taken to hospital with serious injuries.

The boy who is believed to have been the driver of the bike is in a life threatening condition.

No arrests have been made in connection with the incident and enquiries are ongoing.

Sergeant Matt Picton, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "Two 14-year-old boys have been left seriously injured as a result of this collision and we are keen to speak with anyone who may have information about the circumstances leading up to what happened.

"We know that the Audi had been travelling on Crayford Road and the bike travelling on Surbiton Road before the incident. Therefore there could have been a number of potential witnesses who saw either vehicle in the time leading up to the collision.

"I want to appeal to these potential witnesses, particularly anyone with dashcam footage, to please come forward and assist our enquiries."

Anybody with information should contact the GMP Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 0161 856 4741, quoting incident number 2316 of 13/06/20, or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
