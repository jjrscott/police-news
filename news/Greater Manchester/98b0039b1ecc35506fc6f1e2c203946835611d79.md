At around 12.30am on Sunday 1 November 2020, police were called to reports of a disturbance at a residential property in The Works, Withy Grove.

Officers attended and found approximately 50-60 people inside a two bedroom flat. Those in attendance weren't social distancing or wearing face coverings. Music was being played via a sound system comprising of commercial-sized speakers.

After reviewing the evidence, yesterday (Friday 5 November 2020), police issued a £10,000 FPN to the organiser (a 38-year-old man) for contravening the requirement not to hold, or be involved in the holding of, a gathering of more than 30 persons in a private dwelling.

Superintendent Chris Hill, of GMP's City of Manchester district, said: "Though Greater Manchester Police follows national guidance to engage with individuals, explain restrictions and encourage compliance before enforcing, people must take responsibility for their actions and organising this flat party was a clear act of non-compliance which put those in attendance at risk of Covid and could, ultimately, increase demand on the NHS.

"As well as prompting the organiser to reflect on his actions and consider the risks, I hope the issuing of this £10,000 Fixed Penalty Notice warns anyone planning a gathering of more than 30 people of the potential consequences of doing so. I would also like to use this opportunity to encourage members of the public to comply with the restrictions which are there to protect everyone, including them and their loved ones, from the virus."
