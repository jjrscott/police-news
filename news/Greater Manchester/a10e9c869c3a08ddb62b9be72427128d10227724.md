A man has been arrested as part of an investigation into illegal online streaming services.

On Thursday 30 July 2020, police executed a warrant at a property in the Leigh area of Wigan.

A 36-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of fraud and copyright under the Designs and Patents Act 1988. He has since been released under investigation.

Officers also seized a number of electronic devices including computers, phones, digital satellite television boxes and viewing cards.

Enquiries are ongoing.

Detective Constable Michelle Wilkinson, of GMP's Economic Crime Unit, said: "This warrant was executed as part of an investigation in to the illegal provision of premium TV content. This type of crime can result in companies losing a significant amount of revenue each year.

"I hope today's action serves as a warning to offenders that neither companies nor Greater Manchester Police will tolerate this behaviour and that we will work together to identify anyone responsible for providing illegal online streaming services."
