At around 9am on Monday 16 March police carried out a search warrant at Hampson Farm on Coal Pit Road.

The warrant was carried out by police officers from Bolton's Operation Challenger - Greater Manchester's partnership approach to tackling serious and organised crime.

During the warrant officers discovered a sophisticated cannabis farm in a secured barn containing 168 plants where electricity was abstracted directly from the main power supply.

No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing as officers gather evidence that might identify those responsible for the cannabis farm.

Detective Sergeant Paul Quinn of GMP's Bolton Challenger Team said: "This was clearly a significant and well-equipped cannabis farm that has been discovered and taken out of production by our team of officers.

"We hope this discovery will considerably disrupt the supply of cannabis in Bolton and Greater Manchester and prevent more harm coming to our community.

"Our team is committed to bringing those involved in organised crime to justice but in order to do that we need intelligence from the local community regarding the activities of individuals connected to organised crime groups and I would appeal to anyone who might have any information to get in touch as soon as possible."

Anyone who has any information should call police 0161 856 5625 quoting incident number 629 of 16/03/2020.

Details can also be passed on anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
