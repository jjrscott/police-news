Five men and a woman have been arrested after police executed warrants in Manchester and Salford on Friday evening and seized large quantities of cash and drugs.

On Friday 19 March, officers from GMP's Salford district searched an address off Littleton Road in the Kersal area where a considerable amount of cash - believed to be in excess of Â£5000 - was recovered as well as some white powder.

A 24-year-old man and a 21-year-old woman were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a controlled drug and money laundering.

They have both been questioned by detectives and released on bail.

Later that evening, GMP's Serious and Organised Crime Group (SOCG) arrested four more men in the Strangeways area where a substantial amount of cash and approximately 7 kilos of suspected class A and B drugs were recovered.

The men - aged between 23 and 41 years old - were taken to custody for questioning and have since been released under investigation.

The action is part of a SOCG investigation into drug supply in the Manchester and Salford areas. A total of 12 arrests have been made as part of the operation since its inception earlier this month.

Anyone with information or concerns about the supply of illegal drugs should contact police online, via 101 or always 999 in an emergency. Details can be passed to the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
