Officers investigating an assault near the Trafford Centre on Christmas Eve have released images of two men they wish to speak in connection with the incident.

At around 5pm on Thursday 24 December 2020, officers were called to a report of three people - a father, mother and son - being attacked by three other men in a car park at the Trafford Centre.

The father - a 39-year-old man - received injuries to his eye socket for which he is still receiving ongoing treatment.

A 23 year-old man has been voluntarily interviewed and remains under investigation.

Today (Tuesday 16 February) investigators are appealing for information about the identity of two men who they have released images of as part of their enquiries.

Police believe there are links between the men pictured and the Middleton and North Manchester areas.

Anyone with information is asked to get in touch on 0161 856 5050 quoting incident 1879 of 24/12/2020. Details can be passed anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
