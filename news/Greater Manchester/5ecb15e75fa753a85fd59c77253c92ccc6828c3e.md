The 40-year-old man, who was arrested on suspicion of committing a terrorism offence, has now been assessed by specialist doctors and compulsorily detained under the Mental Health Act.

The investigation will continue in order to fully understand the motives behind the attack.

There is not believed to be any wider threat to the communities of Greater Manchester and the attacker is believed to have acted alone.

We are continuing to ask that any images or footage that may have been taken at the scene is provided to police via http://www.ukpoliceimageappeal.co.uk/

Anyone who may have information that could assist the investigation should call 0161 856 0394.
