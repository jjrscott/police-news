A man has been arrested following a shooting in Wigan.

At around 12.15am on Thursday 12 September 2019, police were called to reports that a firearm had been discharged on Vicarage Road.

A 44-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder on Friday 13 September 2019.

He has since been released under investigation.

A 41-year-old woman who was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds has been released from hospital.

A short time after the firearms discharge on Vicarage Road, officers responded to reports of a second shooting on Redland Court in Ashton-in-Makerfield.

Enquiries are ongoing.

Chief Inspector Liz Sanderson, of GMP's Wigan district, said: "Our thoughts remain with the victim and her family whilst she continues her recovery.

"Our enquiries are continuing and we are working hard to piece together the circumstances of these incidents.

"This kind of violence has no place on our streets, and it will not be tolerated.

"If you have any information about these incidents, please get in touch with us as a matter of urgency."
