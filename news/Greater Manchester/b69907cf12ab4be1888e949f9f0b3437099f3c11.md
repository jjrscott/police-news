GMP road officers are advising motorists on how to stay safe as the darker nights draw in earlier.

Data from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) shows each year when the clocks go back, there is a spike in the number of vulnerable road users killed or seriously injured.

To help you stay safe, GMP has put together advice on increasing your safety while driving in the dark.

 * Keep your car windows clean to avoid increased glare and condensation
 * Dip your lights when faced with another road user so you don't dazzle them
 * Turn your headlights on before sunset and keep them on for an hour after sunrise to help other drivers see you in twilight
 * Keep up-to-date with your eye tests to ensure your vision isn't affected at night
 * Be aware of other road users who may behave erratically, so be prepared to give them more space
 * Take extra care and look again, particularly at junctions, when your view may be limited in dark conditions
