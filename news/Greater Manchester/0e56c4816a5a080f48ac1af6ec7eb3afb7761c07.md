Two men have been charged with the murder of a man in North Manchester last week.

Officers were called shortly before 4.50am on Thursday 18 February to reports that a man had been stabbed on Whitstable Road, Manchester.

Emergency services attended and 39-year-old Alan Murphy, from Moston, was taken to hospital in critical condition but sadly died hours later.

William Doleman (11/03/1994), of Rossington Road, Moston, and Ademola Efunnuga (07/07/1995), of City Road East, Manchester, have both been charged with murder.

They will appear at Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court this morning (22 February 2021).
