Milo Lyndsay (17/02/1986) of Longport Avenue, Manchester, has been charged with two counts of section 18 assault, one count of possession of an offensive weapon and one count of failing to comply with a court order.

He appeared at Manchester Magistrates' Court on Friday 31 January 2020 and has been remanded in custody until he next appears at Manchester Crown Court on Friday 28 February 2020.

Officers were called at around 1.45am on Thursday 30 January 2020 to a report of two men - aged 21 and 22 - being stabbed inside a nightclub on Wilmslow Road.

Both men received serious facial injuries but have since been discharged from hospital.
