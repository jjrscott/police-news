Officers are appealing for witnesses following a fail-to-stop road traffic collision in Manchester that has left a woman in critical condition.

At around 6.50pm yesterday (24 September 2020), officers were called to a report of a road traffic collision involving a silver Vauxhall Corsa and a black Mercedes A200 on Mauldeth Road West.

The Corsa, believed to have been stolen, was travelling along the road towards the junction with Nell Lane when it collided with the Mercedes.

The driver of the Corsa ran from the scene on foot and a woman, in her 30s, was left in the vehicle in critical condition and taken to hospital where she remains.

The driver of the Mercedes, a man in his 30s, suffered minor injuries.

Sergeant Matthew Picton, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "This collision has left a woman fighting for her life in hospital and we're asking the public to come forward with any information that may assist with our investigation.

"Anyone who may have seen anything or may have seen either of the vehicles prior to the collision, or anyone who may have any dash-cam footage, should contact us by calling 0161 856 4741 quoting incident number 2332 of 24/09/20.

"Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
