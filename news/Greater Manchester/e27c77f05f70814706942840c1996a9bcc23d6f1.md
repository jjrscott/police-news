At around 9:30am on Thursday 31 October 2019, police were called to Bramhall Lane South to reports of a collision.

A black Zenos collided with a grey Volkswagen Touareg after passing a black Audi A5 that was turning right into Carwood Road.

Emergency services attended and the driver of the Zenos - a 45-year-old man - was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. The driver of the Volkswagen Touareg - a 41-year-old woman - was treated at the scene for minor injuries.

Bramhall Lane South was closed while investigation work was carried out - but has since been reopened.

Enquiries are ongoing.

Sergeant Andrew Page, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "This was a tragic accident where a man has sadly lost his life. Specialist officers are with his family and supporting them through this horrific time.

"This happened at a busy time of the day, so I would like to encourage anyone who may have any information that can assist our enquiries to come forward.

"We're particularly keen to speak to any witnesses with dash cam footage who saw either of the cars in the lead up to the collision. If you have any information that could help - please get in touch as a matter of urgency."

Anyone with any information should call GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 0161 856 4741 quoting incident number 763 of 31/10/19.

Reports can also be made anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
