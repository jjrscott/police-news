Police are appealing for the public's help to identify a man they wish to speak to in connection with a double stabbing in Piccadilly Gardens.

The incident - which took place outside Morrison's on Monday 10 February 2020 - left a 42-year-old man and a 17-year-old boy with serious injuries. Both the man and boy have since been discharged from hospital.

An 18-year-old man has been charged with two counts of section 18 assault and one count of possession of a knife in connection with the incident. A 21-year-old man, who was arrested on suspicion of section 18 assault, has been released under investigation.

Detective Constable Bethan Copplestone, of GMP's City of Manchester division, said: "I want to stress that our team of detectives have been working relentlessly to investigate every single line of enquiry available to us.

"We are asking the public to please take a look at these images in the hope that somebody will be able to identify the man pictured and contact the police so we can speak to him in connection with this stabbing.

"If anyone has any information all no matter how insignificant you may feel it is, please contact police immediately. Even the smallest piece of information could prove vital in helping us to complete our investigation.

Anyone with information regarding the identity of the man pictured should contact police on 0161 856 4409, quoting incident number 1199 of 10/02/20.

Details can also be passed anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
