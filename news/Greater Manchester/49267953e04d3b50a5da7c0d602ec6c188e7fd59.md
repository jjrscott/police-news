The family of a woman who was murdered in Manchester have paid tribute to her.

At around 8:30pm on Thursday 7 May 2020, police were called to reports of a concern for welfare at an address on Westminster Street.

Emergency services attended and a woman - who has since been formally identified as 67-year old Hyacinth Morris - was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

A 40-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and has since been detained under the Mental Health Act.

Paying tribute to Hyacinth, her family said: "Hyacinth, you were a great daughter to your father. A beautiful sister, a wonderful sister in law, aunty, great aunty and a dear cousin to all.

"You were loved dearly by all and touched our lives in a positive way.

"Most of all you were a brilliant mother who was adored by your son. You both described each other as each other's best friend.

"We will miss your beautiful smile, your sense of humour and in fact, everything about you.

"Rest in peace till we see you again.

"Your loving family."

Hyacinth Morris
