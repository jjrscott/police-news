Police are appealing for more information after a man died following a collision in Warburton.

Shortly after 11.10pm on Wednesday 11 December 2019 police were called to a report that a black Audi S3 had collided with a tree on Warburton Lane, Partington.

The passenger, a 26-year-old man who was sat in the back of the vehicle, sadly died at the scene.

A 28-year-old man who was driving the car was taken to hospital with serious injuries and is in a stable condition.

A man who was sat in the front passenger seat escaped with minor injuries.

Enquires are ongoing and no arrests have been made.

"Our officers are working hard to determine the events leading up to this tragic incident and are appealing for anyone with dashcam or CCTV footage of the collision to contact police as soon as possible.
