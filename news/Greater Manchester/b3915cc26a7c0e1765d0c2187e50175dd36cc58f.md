Tribute: Gary Nugent Bamping

On Friday 17 January 2020, police were called to reports of a road traffic collision on the M602 in Eccles.

Sadly, 61-year-old Gary Nugent Bamping was pronounced dead at the scene.

Paying tribute to Gary, his family said:

"Gary was a fabulous son, brother, a proud father and Grandfather. He was very much a family man and an extremely good friend.

"He would help anyone at the drop of a hat, always there when you needed him. He touched many lives with his happy go lucky attitude and always wore a smile.

"He always loved to be fixing and making things turning his hand to anything. He touched many lives and will be sadly missed by all."
