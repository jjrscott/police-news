Shortly after 3.06pm on Wednesday 2 October 2019, police were called to reports of a suspicious package at Spotland Stadium, Rochdale.

Staff from the stadium and a number of households on Mons Avenue were evacuated.

Bomb disposal officers attended and a controlled explosion of the package was carried out.

The scene has been closed and people allowed to return to their properties.

The package was deemed to be non-viable.

Enquiries are ongoing.

Chief Inspector Niall Hayden-Pawson of GMP's Rochdale District said: "Public safety is our first priority and I'd like to thank residents for their patience while officers dealt with this incident.

"I would also like to thank the effective partnership working between ourselves, the club and the local authority during our response."
