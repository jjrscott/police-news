Between August and October 2019, police received reports of a number of burglaries in Salford and the surrounding areas.

Investigations were launched and, following extensive enquiries - including CCTV trawls, Gary Spilsbury (23/01/73) of HMP Forrest Bank was arrested and taken in to police custody for questioning, where he was subsequently charged.

Today (Friday 19 February 2021), Gary Spilsbury was sentenced at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court to nine years in jail after pleading guilty to 10 counts of burglary, two counts of robbery, five counts of theft and two counts of fraud.

DC David Potter of GMP's Salford district, said: "Gary Spilsbury was a serial burglar who, on more than one occasion, entered homes and tied lone women's hands and feet together before threatening them and ransacking their properties. Thankfully, no one was injured but the burglaries were understandably traumatising.

"I hope this case reassures members of the public that we work hard to identify criminals and their offences, arrest them and bring them to face justice. I also hope it warns offenders that neither Greater Manchester Police nor the justice system will tolerate this kind of behaviour which so often leaves victims scared in their own homes."
