A man has been charged in relation to a large gathering where a police officer was assaulted and a police car also damaged.

Christian Earnshaw (14/06/1982) of Newark Road, Rochdale has been charged with assault on an emergency worker, criminal damage, possession of Class A and Class B drugs and breach of COVID restrictions.

He has been bailed to appear at Manchester and Salford Magistrates Court on Wednesday 16 September 2020.

At around 6:30pm on Monday 17 August 2020, police were called to reports of a large group of people gathering on some moorlands off Dewhirst Road, Rochdale.

Officers attended and attempted to engage with the group, however despite officer's best efforts the group failed to co-operate.

Additional resources were called upon to attend the incident in support of the officers already in attendance. This led to the group dispersing but a number of individuals refused to move on and became aggressive towards the officers.

Following this incident three fixed penalty notices have been issued so far.
