At around 7.40pm on Friday 1 January 2020, police received a report of fail-to-stop collision on Bury Old Road.

An investigation was launched and officers established that a vehicle had collided with a pedestrian near the junction with Singleton Road. The vehicle, described as a white car, did not stop at the scene.

The pedestrian - a 16 year old sustained minor injuries.

PC Griffiths, of GMP's Salford district, said: "Thankfully, the victim was not seriously injured. Nevertheless, the driver of the vehicle should have stopped at the scene so an investigation is underway to identify them.

"I would like to appeal to anyone with information or dash cam footage from the area at around the time of the incident to contact us or Crimestoppers, anonymously,

"I'd also encourage anyone who knows who was driving the vehicle to do the same."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 5127 quoting 3376 01/01/21 or the independent charity - Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
