Dawn raids saw four people arrested as part of a crackdown on drug supply in Greater Manchester.

Today, Thursday 10 December 2020, police executed warrants at two addresses in Hyde.

Police recovered cocaine, cannabis and heroin with an estimated street value of Â£10,000, alongside mixing agents and several thousand pounds in cash.

Four men- aged 19, 26, 32, and 51- were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A and Class B drugs.

They remain in custody for questioning.

Inspector Stevie Swindells of GMP's Tameside District, said: "We now have four people in custody following this morning's action which was part of our ongoing work to disrupt the supply of drugs across Greater Manchester.

"The making and the supply of drugs is often a catalyst for other criminal enterprises such as burglary, robbery, and child criminal exploitation, so the recovery of such large quantities of illegal substances is a great result, and shows our commitment to disrupting the criminal activities of those causing misery in Tameside.

"I would like to thank those in the community of Hyde who have come forward to police with valuable intelligence to allow today to happen.

"Our work does not stop here, and I want to reassure the public that we will take action against those individuals blighting our community through illegal activities such as drug dealing, and work with partners and the community to bring offenders to justice."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 0200 or 0161 856 9289, or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
