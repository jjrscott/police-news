Did you witness a robbery in Trafford?

Officers are appealing for information after a woman was robbed on Thursday 29 August 2019 in Bowdon, Trafford.

At around 3.40pm two men dressed in dark clothing and wearing balaclavas threatened the woman with a knife then demanded her watch, wallet and mobile phone.

The men pushed the woman to the ground and then drove off in a dark Volvo 4x4 with the items.

Detective Constable David Jarvis, of GMP's Stretford division, said: "This was a violent incident which left the woman understandably shaken from the attack.

"The watch that was stolen from the woman was passed down from her father and holds deep sentimental value.

"I would implore anyone who was in Bowdon at the time of robbery and has any dash cam footage that may assist our enquiries to please get in touch with officers."

Anyone who has any information about the robbery should call police on 0161 856 7743 quoting incident number 1864 of 29/08/2019.

Details can also be passed on anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
