e-fit

At 5pm on Monday 1 February 2021, police received a report that a woman had been assaulted by a man whilst walking in the Cheadle area.

An investigation was launched and enquiries established that, between 4pm and 5pm, the woman was walking on a path near Willow Avenue when the man, who was passing, pushed her over.

The victim sustained an arm injury.

The man is described as being approximately 5ft 10in, of a 'stocky/ chubby' build and over 30-years-old. At the time of the incident, he was wearing a charcoal coloured jacket.

DC Laura Burgess, of GMP's Stockport district, said: "The victim sustained an arm injury for which she had to have surgery. We hope that she is making a fast and full recovery.

"We are releasing this e-fit in the hope that someone can help us identify the man depicted. If that's you, I appeal to you to contact us or Crimestoppers, anonymously.

"It's highly likely that there were others nearby at the time who saw this assault or the offender before or afterwards - I'd also encourage them to come forward.

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 9976 quoting 1997 01/02/21 or the independent charity - Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
