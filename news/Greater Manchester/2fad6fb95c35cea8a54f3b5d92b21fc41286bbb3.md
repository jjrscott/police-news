Officers have been called to a number of reports of criminal damage to properties and cars on Bradshaw Road and Tonge Moor Road.

Enquiries have established that between 1.30am and 3.30am on Saturday 30 January 2020, a group of three people, who were armed with a tool, smashed the windows of several parked cars and caused damage to a number of homes and properties.

On one occasion, the group stole money from inside one the cars after smashing the windows and on a second occasion, a drain pipe was ripped from a house.

No-one has been injured, but a significant amount of damage has been caused to a number of cars and properties.

The group are described as being two boys and one girl aged between 15 and 18.

No arrests have been made and enquiries are ongoing.

PCSO Tom Burton, of GMP's Bolton division, said: "Although no-one has thankfully been injured as a result of this thoughtless vandalism, a number of innocent people have been inconvenienced and left with damage to their property which can be expensive to repair.

"Officers are thoroughly investigating these incidents and following all available lines of enquiry to identify those responsible.

"If anyone was in the area at the time and witnessed anything suspicious, or has any CCTV footage that could help police with their enquiries, please do not hesitate to get in touch with police."

Anyone with information should contact police on 0161 856 5761 quoting incident number 1140 of 30/01/2021.

Reports can also be made anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
