Earlier today (Sunday 19 July 2020), an officer beginning their shift found that their property had been vandalised with a Swastika.

This was reported to the leadership team and an internal investigation was immediately launched after it was declared a hate crime and critical incident.

Assistant Chief Constable Mabs Hussain said: "This is an absolutely disgraceful and disgusting act and I can wholeheartedly say that we are appalled that one of our employees felt that this behaviour was acceptable.

"It will not be tolerated and an investigation is underway by detectives alongside colleagues from our Professional Standards Branch. A colleague has been subjected to a hate crime and there is no place for behaviour like this in GMP or policing nationally and it's being treated incredibly seriously.

"We serve one of the most culturally diverse areas in the United Kingdom and we're incredibly proud to have a diverse workforce to serve and represent our communities. It is absolutely unacceptable that an officer has been faced with such an atrocity during their shift and we're urging any officers or staff with any information to report it.

"We are currently supporting the officer and I have spoken to the officer on a number of occasions today to update them on our investigation and offer them further support."
