A large cordon is in place whilst detectives investigate a reported firearms discharge in St Peter's Square in the city centre this evening (27 February 2021).

Officers received a report of a suspected firearms discharge and a road traffic collision just before 8.30pm.

Emergency services quickly attended and found an abandoned vehicle on the tram tracks in the Square. No one is believed to have been injured at this time.

Two 16-year-old boys and a 19-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and possession of a firearm. They all remain in custody.

Superintendent Helen Critchley, from GMP's City of Manchester division, said: "We understand that this incident has no doubt caused concerns in the city centre and those living by but I'd like to reassure them that a thorough investigation is underway.

"Officers are at the scene and a large cordon is in place whilst a number of enquiries are carried out to establish what happened during this incident.

"Three arrests have been made and our efforts to piece together what happened continue.

"Anyone who was nearby at the time or has any information is asked to get in touch. Any details may prove vital and those with information can call 0161 856 4409 quoting log number 2989 of 27/02/2021.
