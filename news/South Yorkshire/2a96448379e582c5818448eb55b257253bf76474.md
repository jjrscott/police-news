Roads Policing Officers are appealing for dash-cam footage and witnesses following a fatal collision in Dinnington.
Officers responded to reports of a single car road traffic collision involving a grey Lexus NX at 12:52pm yesterday (19 October) on Todwick Road in Dinnington.

The grey Lexus NX is believed to have crossed the carriageway before colliding with the trees and hedges.

Upon officersâ€™ arrival they found a 72 year-old man in cardiac arrest. Officers started CPR until Yorkshire Ambulance Service attended but sadly the man was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at hospital.

His family have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers.

Officers believe the man may have been at the waste disposal site before heading onto Todwick Road. Officers are keen to speak to anyone who may dash-cam footage of the car prior to the collision or any witnesses to the incident.

Did you see the car? Can you help? If you have any information that can help officers please call 101 quoting incident number 338 of 19 October 2020.
