South Yorkshire Police is supporting the below events, which are being held by the Home Office as part of their national police officer recruitment campaign. You must register in advance for this event, and there are only 250 places nationwide for each of the sessions. Please consider which event is relevant to you before signing up.

The first, which takes place on Thursday 21 January 2021, is aimed at individuals from a Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic background. You will hear from officers within South Yorkshire Police about the opportunities we offer and support provided to BAME officers within our force. There will also be speakers who will talk through their experiences of joining the police, and from national organisations on how they can help. https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/make-your-difference-bame-police-careers-discovery-event-tickets-131914729507

The second event, which takes place on Tuesday 26 January, is for neurodiverse and disabled individuals, where you will have the chance to listen to speakers and ask questions, with time in the session to speak to South Yorkshire Police about the support we provide. https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/make-your-difference-neurodiversity-disability-police-careers-event-tickets-131916494787

On Thursday 28 January, individuals with a religion, faith or belief are encouraged to attend to hear from existing police officers from across the country, and take the opportunity to speak directly to South Yorkshire Police in a dedicated breakout session. https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/make-your-difference-religion-belief-police-careers-discovery-event-tickets-132029223963
