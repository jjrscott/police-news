Officers in Doncaster are appealing for information following criminal damage to vehicles at a Doncaster garage.

At 9pm on 29 January we received reports of youths causing damage to a number of vehicles on the forecourt of JCT600 dealership on Wheatley Road.

The damage caused to the vehicles is estimated to be around Â£50,000. It is believed the group included around five youths, aged between 14-17 years old, wearing dark clothing.

Since the incident officers have conducted local enquiries in the area and at other local dealerships, they are now urging anyone with information to get in touch.

Can you help? Please call 101 quoting crime reference number 14/22941/21. Alternatively you can provide information anonymously via the Crimestoppers website.
