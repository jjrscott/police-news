Police in Sheffield are investigating after fireworks were thrown into a police car on Wensley Street in Grimesthorpe on Saturday (31 October).

Officers had been responding to a failure to stop at around 10.45pm when a group of youths approached the car and threw a lit firework through the open door.

Thankfully the officers were uninjured in the incident, and only minor damage was done to the vehicle.
No arrests have yet been made.

Sheffield North East Neighbourhoods Inspector Gary Bramhall said: “It is appalling that officers who were simply doing their job, protecting the public, have been targeted in this way. Attacks like this place the safety of our officers, and the people they are trying to protect, at risk.

“It is staggering that people would act in such an irresponsible and dangerous way, and incidents like this will not be tolerated.”

Enquiries are ongoing. If you have any information that could help officers, please call 101 and quoting incident number 1260 of 31 October.
