As part of the on-going activity to disrupt criminality across the city, officers have executed a warrant at a property in Heeley Green.

A 46 year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearms ammunition. He remains in police custody.
In connection with the warrant, a Seat Leon car was recovered on Penns Road.

DCI Jamie Henderson said: “This is the third warrant executed across the city today (28 May).

“We are working hard and will continue to do so to disrupt the activity of those that pose a risk to our communities.

“We are stronger with you, and I continue to thank everyone who has helped us with our enquiries into on-going investigations.”
