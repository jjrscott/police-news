Officers in Sheffield have released a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to in connection with an armed robbery.

It is reported that on Wednesday 10 June at around 2pm a 52-year-old man was walking along Arundel Gate when he was approached by a man who claimed to be a police officer. The man demanded Â£65 and when the victim refused, he threatened him with a knife and stole his bag of groceries.

Enquiries are ongoing but officers are keen to identify the man in the image as he may be able to assist with enquiries.

Do you recognise him?
