Detectives are urging residents to be extra vigilant following a string of burglaries in the Wingfield, Anston, Swallownest and Boston Castle areas of Rotherham.

Issuing a warning to local residents, DI Nina Jackson explained: “We’ve seen a small but noticeable spike in incidents where thieves are trying doors to see if they are not locked, and targeting garages, sheds and outbuildings by breaking off padlocks and snapping door locks.

“It may sound strange, but with more people staying at home more, people go to bed earlier, and that’s when thieves strike.

“Please take simple measures to keep your home safe. Lock doors, keep keys and valuables out of reach and ensure outbuildings are secure.”

There is more crime prevention advice for sheds and outbuildings included in the graphic pictured.

DI Jackson continued: “You are our eyes and ears. Please look out for suspicious activity, keep an eye on your neighbours’ property and report anything that doesn’t feel right to police.”

You can report through 101, online or by contacting your local neighbourhood policing team directly.
