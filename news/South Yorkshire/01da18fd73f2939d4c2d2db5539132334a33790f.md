Officers are appealing for information after a pony was attacked by dogs in Conisbrough.

It is reported that at around 11pm on Thursday 10 December, the owners of a small holding on Spring Bank Road heard a disturbance and dogs barking outside.

When they went to bring their pony in from the paddock the following morning, they discovered several deep wounds to its rear legs and neck.

Sadly, the pony had to be put-down as a result of its injuries.

A review of CCTV footage showed three dogs enter the paddock through a hedge. Torchlight can also be seen in the distance along the property boundary.

Due to the poor quality of the footage, identification of any offenders has not been possible.

If you have any information which could help the investigation, please call 101 quoting incident number 263 of 11 December 2020.
