An 18-year-old woman has been sentenced to three months behind bars after she coughed at officers in Barnsley, stating that she wanted to infect them with COVID-19.

The sentencing follows an incident in the early hours of Monday 6 April in which Levi Marsden, of Holwick Court, Barnsley, was arrested in Barnsley Town Centre after she breached a Drug Intervention Programme. On arrival at Barnsley Custody she repeatedly coughed in the presence of officers and when asked to cover her mouth, she refused and said “I hope you get it.”

She was charged with two counts of common assault on the officers and was remanded to court.

She appeared at Sheffield Crown Court on Tuesday (7 April 2020) and was sentenced to three months at a Young Offenders Institution and was ordered to pay £50 in compensation to each of the officers she assaulted.

Following the sentencing, PC Fran Robbs De La Hoyde, who worked on the investigation, said:
“As key workers, our officers are still working tirelessly to keep our local communities safe, and it is appalling that they were assaulted in such a way when they were just trying to do their job.

“I hope the public can be assured by this sentencing that assaults of this nature will not be tolerated.”
