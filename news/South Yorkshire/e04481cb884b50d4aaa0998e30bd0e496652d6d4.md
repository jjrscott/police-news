PCSOs in Sheffield will literally be able to go that ‘extra mile’ for their communities now they have more power in their pedals, thanks to local councillors.

Councillors from Sheffield have funded three electric bikes for use by PSCOs on their patrols across the city and boroughs.

The e-bikes will enable officers to patrol greater distances than they can achieve on foot. They will be used by the Sheffield City Centre Team and the North West Neighbourhood Team.

Sheffield North West Neighbourhood PCSO Anthony Hizam explains more, he said: “These bikes will allow us, as PCSOs to cover a much bigger area than what we can on foot, enabling us to respond to the needs of our community more effectively.

“We are very grateful of the funding from the council to enable us to increase our visibility within our area.”

In addition to increasing the geographical footprint officers patrol, the bikes will also be used during safepass operations- an operation dedicated to ensuring cyclists and drivers share the road safely.

This means that officers will be able to increase their distance and operation length.
