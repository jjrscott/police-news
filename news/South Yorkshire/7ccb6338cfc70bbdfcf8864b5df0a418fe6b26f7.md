Officers in Doncaster are appealing for information after a cyclist was involved in a reported hit-and-run in Warmsworth earlier this year.

Shortly after 4pm on Thursday 21 January, the 69-year-old was cycling along Sheffield Road towards Conisbrough when he was in collision with a vehicle and was knocked off his bike. The vehicle didnâ€™t stop and immediately left the scene.

The man suffered a broken leg in the incident which he is still recovering from.

Due to a wing mirror being found at the scene, officers believe the vehicle involved was a black Seat. We are asking for anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information about a black Seat requiring a new wing mirror to contact us. The collision would have also likely left the vehicle with noticeable damage to its passenger side.

If you can help, please contact us on 101 quoting incident number 637 of 21 January.
