Officers in Sheffield have released a CCTV image of a man they would like to identify and speak to in connection to an attempted knife-point robbery.

It is reported that on 5 March around 4:25pm, the victim, a 22 year-old man has met an unknown man at premises along St Mary’s Road in Sheffield to sell a Play Station 5 console.

It is believed that as the victim was unboxing the Playstation to show the buyer the contents, the man pulled a knife from his trousers and pointed it at the victim and attempted to take the Playstation.

The victim, assisted by a passer-by challenged the man for the Playstation and the knife. The man fled the scene prior to officers’ arrival.

Officers are now keen to speak to the man in the CCTV image as they believe he can assist with their enquiries.

Do you recognise him? Please call 101 quoting incident number 635 of 5 March 2021.
