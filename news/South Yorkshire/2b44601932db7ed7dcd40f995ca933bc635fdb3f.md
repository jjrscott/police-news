A man has been charged following a series of arson incidents in Sheffield earlier this week.

Police received reports from South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue (SYFR) that dustbins had been deliberately set on fire at eight separate properties in the High Green area between 8pm on 23 March and 2am on 24 March.

An 89-year-old woman was taken to hospital to be treated for minor injuries following one of the fires which occurred in Thompson Hill.

Officers from Sheffield Response Team arrested Robert Ashford, 37, of Sunny Bank, High Green, the same evening. He has since been charged with four counts of arson and four counts of arson with recklessness to whether life was endangered.

He will appear before Sheffield Crown Court on 23 April 2021.
