South Yorkshire Police's Operational Support Unit has taken part in a not so secret ‘secret Santa’ to spread Christmas cheer to poorly children and those less fortunate.

As Christmas gets closer, OSU officers have had a different theme to this year’s office secret Santa, in the hope they can spread smiles and happiness to children facing Christmas in hospital or difficult situations.

Each year, officers often take part in a secret Santa, buying each other a small gift, not knowing who has gifted it, this year officers have remained anonymous but with a different theme.

Roads Policing Sergeant Brandon Brown who organised the presents and delivery explains more: “This year, given the financial and medical struggles faced by people during the Covid-19 pandemic, we wanted to help make a little person’s Christmas wish come true.
“We collected a total of 65 presents. Each present was labelled whether it was intended for a boy or a girl and what age group.

“Each present was wrapped by the officer and labelled ‘Merry Christmas from South Yorkshire Police’s OSU’.
“Yesterday (21 December) we delivered the presents to The Children’s Hospital Charity at Sheffield Children’s Hospital.

“We hope the children receiving the presents, along with everyone across South Yorkshire has a wonderful Christmas, remember, we’re all in it together and we are still here for you.”

From everyone at SYP we wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
