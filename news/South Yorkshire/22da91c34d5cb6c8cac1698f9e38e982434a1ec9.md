Two brothers who were accused of killing Isaiah Usen-Satchell in Sheffield on New Year's Day 2020 have been cleared.

Twins Isaac and Jacob Mwanza, both 19, of Rother View Road, Rotherham, were charged with murder after Mr Usen-Satchell died of a slash wound to his wrist following an incident in Norfolk Park on Wednesday 1 January 2020.

The brothers went on trial for murder on 7 December. Before Christmas, Sheffield Crown Court Judge Peter Kelson QC directed the jury to find both defendants not guilty of murder, and to find Jacob not guilty of manslaughter.

Isaac was still accused of manslaughter and his trial continued, but following a review by the Crown Prosecution Service, the judge further directed the jury to find him not guilty on 6 January.

The South Yorkshire Police investigation into Mr Usen-Satchell's death has now concluded.
