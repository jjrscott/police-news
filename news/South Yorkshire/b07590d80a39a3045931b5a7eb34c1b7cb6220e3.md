Police in Rotherham are asking for witnesses to come forward following a robbery at a property in Maltby.

It is reported that on 26 December 2020 at around 8:30pm, two unknown offenders followed the victim to an address in Cheetham Drive. Once inside, the offenders threatened the victim with a knife and demanded he hand over money.

The victim sustained a cut to his face during the incident, but was able to flee to a nearby address and notify police.

The offenders are believed to have been wearing ski masks at the time of the incident.

After following several lines of enquiry including CCTV trawls, police are now asking for anyone with information that might help their investigation to come forward.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you see or hear anything suspicious? Did you see anyone behaving suspiciously in the area?

If you can help, please call 101 quoting crime reference number 14/188574/20.

Alternatively, you can stay completely anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers via their website Crimestoppers-uk.org or by calling their UK Contact Centre on 0800 555 111.
