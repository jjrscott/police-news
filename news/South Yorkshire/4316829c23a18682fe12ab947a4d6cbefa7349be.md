A 30-year-old man has today (Tuesday 17 November) been charged with the murder of Kamran Khan.

Thamraze Khan, of Club Garden Road, Sheffield, has been remanded into custody to appear at Sheffield Magistrates’ Court tomorrow (Wednesday) morning.

Police were called to a property on Club Garden Road, Sharrow at 2.15am on Sunday (15 November), where Kamran, 28, was found with serious injuries. He was taken to hospital but was sadly pronounced dead shortly after.

A post-mortem examination revealed he died a result of a stab wound to the chest.

Detectives are still keen to hear from anyone with information that could help the investigation. Please call 101 quoting incident number 99 of 15 November 2020. You can also give information anonymously to independent charity Crimestoppers via their website – www.crimestoppers-uk.org – or by calling their UK Contact Centre on 0800 555 111.
