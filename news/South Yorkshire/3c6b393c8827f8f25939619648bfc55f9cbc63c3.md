A man who was critically injured after being involved in a collision with a car in Doncaster last week has sadly died in hospital.

At around 2pm on 17 February, the man, a delivery driver for Amazon, was delivering parcels in Barnby Dun Road, Clay Lane when he was reportedly involved in a collision with an orange Nissan Note.

The 21-year-old was taken to hospital, but sadly died yesterday evening (21 February).
