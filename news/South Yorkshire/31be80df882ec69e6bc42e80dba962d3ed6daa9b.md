Three people arrested yesterday (30 January) on suspicion of murder have today (31 January) been bailed pending further enquiries.

Two men aged 25 and 31 and a 19-year-old woman were arrested yesterday, after a 45-year-old man was found with serious injuries on South Road in High Green, Sheffield.

He was sadly pronounced dead while being taken to hospital.

A post mortem examination carried out yesterday determined that the cause of death was a bleed on the brain, but further medical examination is required to understand how the death occurred.

Enquiries are continuing. Anybody with information should call 101 quoting incident number 54 of 30 January 2021.
