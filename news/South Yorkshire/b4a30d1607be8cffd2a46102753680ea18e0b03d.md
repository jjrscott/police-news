A 43-year-old man who died following an incident in Barnsley earlier this month has been named as Catalin Rizea.

Catalin was found with significant injuries at a property on Pindar Oakes Cottages on 12 October. He was taken to hospital where he sadly died two days later.

Catalinâ€™s family is being supported by specially trained officers and has asked for their privacy to be respected at this very difficult time.

Gabriel Andrei, 40, and Florin Andrei, 44, have been charged with murder and grievous bodily harm (GBH) and appeared in court earlier this week.

At around 8am on 12 October, a 44-year-old man presented at Kendray Hospital in Barnsley with serious head injuries. As officers were carrying out enquiries into how he became injured, they found Catalin with significant injuries at a property on Pindar Oakes Cottages.

The 44-year-old man who presented at Kendray Hospital has since been discharged from hospital.

At a court hearing on Monday (19 October), Gabriel and Florin Andrei, both of Pindar Oakes Cottages, Barnsley, were remanded into custody.
