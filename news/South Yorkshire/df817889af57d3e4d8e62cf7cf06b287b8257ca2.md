A 15-year-old boy has been charged in connection with the rape of a woman in Sheffield.

At around 6pm on 23 November, it was reported that a 21-year-old woman was raped by a group of four males in High Hazels Park.

The 15-year old boy has been charged with sexual assault. He has been remanded in custody appearing in court tomorrow (17 December 2020).

This is the latest charge after four teenagers aged 13, 14, 15 and 16, were arrested in the Darnall area on 2 December 2020.

Since then, the 16 year-old boy and 14-year-old boy have also been charged with rape and attempted sexual assault respectively.

The 13-year-old boy has been released on police bail.
