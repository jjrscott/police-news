Detectives in Doncaster are appealing for information after a series of incidents in the town overnight.

At 3.57am this morning (12 December) officers attended reports that a man had been assaulted on Urban Road in Hexthorpe.

A 29-year-old man was taken to hospital with serious injuries and is in hospital in a stable condition.

Witnesses report seeing two vehicles leave the scene.

Around the same time, police also received a report of a number of vehicles being abandoned on Greenfield Lane.

A short time later, at 4.11am, officers received a further call reporting that a second man had been found injured on Cleveland Street.

It is believed he had been involved in a disturbance prior to police arrival.

The 29-year-old man was taken to hospital with serious injuries.

Two men, aged 26 and 29, have since been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and remain in police custody.

Detectives are currently treating the three incidents as linked. There is no wider risk to the public.

Enquiries are ongoing, and officers are appealing for anyone who saw or heard anything at either location to contact them on 101.

Please quote incident number 142 of 12 December when you call.
