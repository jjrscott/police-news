Police are appealing for witnesses after a car failed to stop for police on Beever Hill Road, Woodhouse, last night (30 October 2020).

It is reported that at around 7:30pm police attempted to pull over a white Citroen at the junction of Beever Hill Road and Market Street to advise them to turn on their headlights.

The Citroen failed to stop for police and drove off down Beighton Road in the direction of the A57. Attempting to overtake a vehicle on the opposite side of the road, the Citroen then collided with a red Peugeot.

The driver of the Peugeot suffered minor injuries in the collision. The driver of the Citroen suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital to receive treatment.

Enquiries are ongoing, but police would like to speak to anyone who might have seen what happened.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you see the fail to stop or the collision? Do you think you might have CCTV or Dashcam footage?
