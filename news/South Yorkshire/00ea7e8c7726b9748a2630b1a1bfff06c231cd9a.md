Officers investigating a reported armed robbery at a shop in the Masbrough area of Rotherham last weekend have released an appeal for information.

At 6.30pm on Sunday 10 January, it is reported that three unknown suspects entered Avondale Store on Avondale Road, Masbrough, threatening staff with a hammer and crowbar.

The three suspects then stole the cash drawer from the till and left the scene in a silver people carrier-type car, possibly a Vauxhall Zafira, which they had arrived at the shop in.

The suspects are described as being male and all were wearing dark clothing with their hoods up and faces covered.

Did you witness the robbery? Did you see the suspects or a silver vehicle in the area on Sunday evening?
