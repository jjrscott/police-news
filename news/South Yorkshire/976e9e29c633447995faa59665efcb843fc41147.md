The family of a man who died following a fatal road traffic collision last week have shared a photograph as enquiries into his death continue.

Last week, Thursday 4 February around 11:36am emergency services attended Long Road in Brampton-en-le-Morthen following reports of a collision involving a motorcycle.

It is believed that a silver Kawasaki motorcycle lost control on the road and collided with trees on the side of the road.

Shane Williams, 24, suffered severe head injuries and was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. His family have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers.

As enquiries continue, Shane’s family have asked that their privacy be respected at this difficult time and they are left to grieve for their loved one, they said: “Shane was a loving son and a loving father to his little girl.

“We are all incredibly upset and ask that our privacy be respected.”

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the motorcycle or may have dash-cam footage of the rider prior to the collision.
