With its long, dark nights and the mince pies from Christmas all long gone, January can be a tough month to get through at the best of times. Add to that the extra challenges we’re all facing right now, it’s a good job we have a bit of news to brighten the start of the new year.

On 11 January, our brilliant SYP officers and call centre staff will star in the first episode of a brand new series of Channel 4 show 999: What’s Your Emergency?

The incredibly popular programme takes an inside look at the day-to-day lives of police officers and call centre staff as they answer and respond to calls from the South Yorkshire public. The film crews joined our teams early in 2020 and the forthcoming shows will provide an insight into such issues as drug and alcohol-related injuries, domestic violence, car accidents and fires.

We’ve had a sneak peek at what’s in store and can say with certainty that it’s essential viewing for anyone who lives in South Yorkshire. Episode one will air at 9pm on Monday 11 January on Channel 4 . Look out for more details and updates closer to the time.
