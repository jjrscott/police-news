Officers in Sheffield are appealing for information about a puppy they believe could be stolen.

On 6 January, officers from our Roads Policing Team attended a property on Broxholme Lane, Doncaster.

Three men were arrested in connection to a suspected stolen car on the driveway and a reported aggravated burglary.

While officers were searching the property, an eight week old puppy was found.

The puppy was taken to the vets to be checked over. The vet believes the puppy to be an English Bulldog cross, possibly an American Bulldog.

The puppy is not microchipped.

Do you recognise the puppy? Do you have any information where he may have come from?

If you can help please call 101 quoting incident number 28 of 6th January.

Do you recognise this puppy?
