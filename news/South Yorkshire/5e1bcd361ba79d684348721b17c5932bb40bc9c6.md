Officers from our off-road bike team are asking for your help to identify riders they would like to speak to in connection to anti-social behaviour and criminal damage in Sheffield.

Enquiries are on- going into criminal damage at the Deepcar filling station on Manchester Road in Sheffield.

Officers are keen to speak to the men in the CCTV images as they believe they hold information into the recent events.

If you have any information that can help officers with their enquiries please call 101 quoting incident number 394 of 26 April 2020.

Alternatively, you can stay completely anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers via their website Crimestoppers-uk.org or by calling their UK Contact Centre on 0800 555 111.
