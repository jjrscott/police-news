Earlier this week a lorry driver was seriously injured after bricks were thrown at his vehicle in Rotherham.

Officers investigating this incident are now appealing to anyone who saw what happened to contact them.

At around 8.30am on Wednesday morning (10 March) the victim, a 46 year old man, was reversing his lorry up Jubilee Street just off Canklow Road, when bricks were reportedly thrown at the vehicle.

PC Leah Tolliday, investigating, said: “These bricks were launched towards the cab and hit the driver in the face, causing serious injuries. This was a thoroughly distressing incident for him, and we are working hard to identify those responsible.

“If you were in the area on Wednesday morning and saw the incident happen or have any dash cam footage which captured what happened, please do get in touch.”

Please give us a call on 101 or use our online reporting portal quoting incident 588 of 10 March.
