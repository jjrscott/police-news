A 60-year-old Sheffield man has been sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of the murder of Maria Howarth.

David Bestwick was found guilty of murder following a trial at Sheffield Crown Court on Friday 26 February.

Today (Monday 1 March) Bestwick was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum term of 17 years.

Maria’s family has released a new photograph and the following short statement:

“Maria believed in the British Justice System and the family would like to thank South Yorkshire Police for their diligence and professionalism in bringing the defendant to justice. But no sentence, however long is as long as the sentence the family will have to endure with this heinous crime that has been committed.”

Detective Chief Inspector James Axe, Senior Investigating Officer, spoke after sentencing. He said: “My condolences once more go to Maria’s family and I echo their sentiment that no sentence passed will ever be able to undo the pain of losing their loved one.

“Bestwick will now spend a considerable period of time behind bars for his mindless, violent crime that took a woman’s life.”
