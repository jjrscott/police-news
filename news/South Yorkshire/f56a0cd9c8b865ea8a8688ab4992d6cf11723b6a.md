Were you in Burngreave this morning? Can you help our officers?

We have launched an appeal for information after a serious collision on Burngreave Road in Sheffield this morning (30 March).

It is reported that at around 6.05am a silver Vauxhall Astra was travelling along Minna Road, when it was in collision with a bollard and brick wall close to the junction with Burngreave Road.

The vehicle then struck traffic lights at the pedestrian crossing outside the Premier Convenience Store close to Burngreave Street.

The driver of the vehicle, a man in his 50s, is believed to have suffered a medical episode at the wheel and was taken to hospital, where he remains in a critical condition.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who saw what happened and are asking anyone who has any information to contact them.

If you can help, please call 101 or submit an online report quoting incident number 146 of 30 March.
