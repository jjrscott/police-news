Officers are investigating the reported theft of a snow clearing vehicle from the Northern General Hospital last week.

It is reported that on Tuesday 1 December, a ‘Bobcat’ plough and gritting vehicle was stolen from a contractor’s compound within the hospital grounds.

The two-seater, white vehicle was reportedly stolen without a key at around 5.30pm.

The bobcat is very distinctive and is one of only twenty vehicles in the country.

PC Gurdeep Atwal said: “Our enquiries are continuing, but I am urging anyone who was at the hospital that day and saw the vehicle on the move, to contact us.

“Even the smallest bit of information might help us piece together what happened, and possibly locate the vehicle.

“I’d also like anyone who may have seen such a vehicle for sale, or been offered one of these machines, to get in touch.”

Please call 101 with any information and quote crime reference number 14/177614/20 when you call.
