A group of volunteers who are responsible for keeping High Green’s parks looking bright and beautiful have been reunited with stolen gardening equipment thanks to the local neighbourhood team.

On 13 January, a storage container used by High Green in Bloom was broken into by thieves, who stole tools and other equipment.

It was a blow for the group, who have guardianship of Mortomley Park and work all year round to keep the area looking neat and tidy whilst also carrying out litter picks across High Green.

After various enquiries by the local neighbourhood team, officers recovered some of the stolen items at an address just several weeks later and last week they paid a visit to the volunteers to return the goods!

Sergeant Matt Cook from the High Green policing team said: “High Green in Bloom do such a fantastic job of keeping community spirit going in this area, so we were really frustrated to hear they had been targeted by thieves.

“Some great work by my team meant we tracked down some of the missing equipment at a property in High Green not long after it was taken. Two people were also arrested and have been released under investigation whilst we complete a few more enquiries.

“We wanted to do something nice for the volunteers, so we dropped by to return the equipment and a bunch of flowers to say thank you for their hard work.”
