South Yorkshire Police’s Director of Resources, Jacqueline Bland responds to Home Office figures on police uplift released yesterday:

“South Yorkshire Police remains in a strong position with recruitment of student police officers.

“Following our last successful live application period in September 2020, we will be exceeding our originally projected headcount for the end of this year by 106 officers.

“We have met the Home Office targets for this year while recruiting under our own uplift plans, which Chief Constable Stephen Watson QPM announced back in June 2019.

“This means our numbers are actually higher than those reflected in the Home Office figures, and so far, since our recruitment in 2020/21 we have seen 401 officers join us in total, helping us to achieve both uplifts.

“We recognise we still have a way to go in properly reflecting the communities we serve, however since recruitment started we have seen growth in both female and Black, Asian and Minority ethnic minority applications.

“During our last live recruitment period we saw a greater increase in female applications, and we hope to see similar across ethnic minority communities in our future live periods.

“We expect to be opening for applications again in May 2021, but if anyone would like to find out more or sign up for a job alert, you can find all the details here – www.southyorks.police.uk/bethefuture”
