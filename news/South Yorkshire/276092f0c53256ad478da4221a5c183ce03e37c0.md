A 17-year-old boy will appear in court today (16 February) after a 70-year-old cyclist was pushed off his bike and robbed in Rotherham last month.

The investigation was launched after the man was reportedly pushed off his e-bike before having it stolen while cycling through Thurcroft on 27 January. He suffered four broken ribs as a result of the incident.

The teenager was detained on Friday evening (12 February) and was charged with robbery and Grievous Bodily Harm (GBH) the following day. He will appear before Magistrates later.
