Police in Barnsley are asking for your help to locate a stolen quad-bike following a burglary in the Penistone area.

It is reported that at around midnight on 11 December 2020, offenders broke into several outbuildings at a farm in Crow Edge and stole items from within, including a Honda 420 quad bike (pictured).

The offenders are then believed to have fled towards the Cortonwood and Bolton On Dearne areas.

Police are now appealing for information that may help re-unite the quad bike with its rightful owners.

Have you seen a quad bike in the area matching the description? Do you know who might be responsible?

If you can help, please call 101 quoting incident number 67 of 11 December 2020.

Alternatively, you can stay completely anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers via their website Crimestoppers-uk.org or by calling their UK Contact Centre on 0800 555 111.
