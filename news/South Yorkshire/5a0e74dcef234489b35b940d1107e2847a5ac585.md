South Yorkshire Police has been recognised for its support of the Armed Forces community by being awarded the Defence Employer Recognition Scheme Silver Award.

Employers that pledge, demonstrate or advocate support to the Armed Forces community, and align their values with the Armed Forces Covenant, can be considered for the awards.

By receiving a silver award, South Yorkshire Police has also successfully upheld the key principles of the Armed Forces Covenant: recognising the skills and contribution veterans and reservists bring to the workplace and society as a whole.

This latest accolade comes after the force signed the Armed Forces Covenant in July 2019, and received a bronze award in November 2019.

By signing the Covenant, and continuing to uphold its values, the force pledged to:

\- Support the employment of veterans of all ages

\- Support the requirements of members of staff who are reservists by accommodating for deployment or training wherever possible

\- Recognise the transferable skills armed forces personnel bring to the organisation in the recruitment of new members of staff

\- Offer ongoing professional and mental health support for veterans and reservists employed by South Yorkshire Police

\- Inform members of staff about Project Nova and support the work they do

Army veteran and South Yorkshire Police Inspector David Struggles said: “I am delighted that we now hold this award. It is a brilliant way to re-affirm our close connection with Armed Forces personnel past and present.

“We are lucky to count so many brilliant veterans and serving reservists as South Yorkshire Police employees. We will continue to do all we can to support them, as well as the wider Armed Forces community within South Yorkshire as a whole.”
