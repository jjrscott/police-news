Last night's episode of Channel 4’s 999: What’s Your Emergency? took us back to the first few months of 2020, when we were unaware of the colossal impact Coronavirus would have.

As we were being told to stay at home, officers and call centre staff remained on the frontline responding to incidents as they always have, ensuring victims of crime receive the support they need during the most difficult of times.

Over the last 11 months we’ve all had to adjust the way we live, and it’s been tough. Thank you for the support you have shown our officers and staff, it means a great deal to them all.

The mass vaccination programme is now underway and there is light at the end of the tunnel but for now, we must continue to stay at home, save lives and protect the NHS.
