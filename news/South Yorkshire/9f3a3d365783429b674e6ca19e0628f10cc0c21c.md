We are appealing for witnesses to a collision that happened on Bawtry Road, Brinsworth, Rotherham in the early hours of this morning (10 May 2020).

At around 12:40am, it is reported that a grey Volkswagon Golf was travelling down Bawtry Road, when it collided with a garden wall of a property and flipped onto its roof.

Police and paramedics attended the scene.

The driver of the vehicle, a man in his twenties, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. His family are currently being supported by specially trained officers as our enquiries continue. The passenger, a 20-year-old man, was taken to hospital via ambulance to be treated for serious injuries.

We are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the collision, especially anyone who has dash cam footage.
Please call 101 quoting incident number 32 of 10 May 2020 if you can help.
