We need your help to find Lily, a brown and white Springer Spaniel who was in her owner’s car when it was stolen in Sheffield.

Lily is a much-loved family pet and her owners are desperate to get her back.

It is reported that just after 5.30pm on Wednesday 23 December, a 67 plate red Audi A3 saloon belonging to Lily’s owners was taken from The Moor area of Sheffield city centre and driven up Ecclesall Road away from the city centre. It is believed that Lily was still inside the vehicle when it was taken.

Our officers immediately launched an investigation and have been working hard to trace Lily and the car.

You may have seen appeals for information and possible sightings from Lily’s family on social media. We’d like to thank everybody has been in touch with us so far and are now issuing a direct appeal for information to get Lily home.

Have you seen Lily? Were you in The Moor or Ecclesall Road area on the evening of 23 December? Do you have dashcam footage that may help with our investigation?

If you can help us reunite a distraught family with their pet, please call 101 quoting investigation number 14/187369/20.
