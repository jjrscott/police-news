Three men who were cultivating and producing cannabis at a former fishing tackle store in Sheffield have each been jailed for two and a half years.

Fatjon Plaku, 25, Ismail Igeleku, 26, and Joni Stani, 36, were all found in the roof of the premises on Stoke Street during a warrant by officers from Proactive CID on 9 November last year.

PC Liam Stewart said: “The unit was formerly occupied by Fishing Republic, but at the time of our warrants the owner wasn’t known, and the rates hadn’t been paid for many months.

“As we were forcing entry to the front of the building, officers covering the back doors noticed tiles being moved around on the roof with three men suddenly appearing through a large hole.

“The trio were promptly arrested, and it was clear once inside that they had been involved in large scale production of cannabis. It was a sophisticated set-up, complete with bedrooms and a kitchen full of fresh food. The men weren’t being held captive, they had full control over access to the address.

“We seized 1,276 plants and 60 kilograms of cropped cannabis from the premises.”

During police interviews, the men all revealed they were originally from Albania and had entered the country illegally to find work.

PC Gareth Webb, also from Sheffield Proactive CID, added: “Each of these men had willingly engaged in criminal activity and it is right they will all be serving time behind bars.

“The sentences they have received are fairly substantial when it comes to this type of offence, which is a positive result for the community and will hopefully act as a deterrent as well.

“There is no doubt that this type of set-up is part of wider organised criminality happening in our city and this type of disruption work takes money out of the pockets of those causing harm in our communities.”

Yesterday the men, all of Stoke Street, were sentenced at Sheffield Crown Court for being concerned in the production of cannabis after pleading guilty at a previous hearing.
