As previously reported, South Yorkshire Police is in the process of obtaining all evidence the coroners had reference to at the inquests into the deaths of Mr Jason Mercer, Mr Alexandru Murgeanu and Mrs Nargis Begum.

A Senior Investigating Officer has been assigned to this matter, and will be overseeing the review of all the materials obtained. At this time, we have not yet received the evidence from Mr Mercer and Mr Murgeanuâ€™s inquest.

This activity will allow SYP to ascertain whether a crime has been committed, with a view to the possible commencement of criminal proceedings.

SYP remains in close consultation with the Health and Safety Executive and the Crown Prosecution Services.
