Officers in Rotherham are appealing for your help to identify a man they would like to speak to in connection to armed robberies at two post offices.

Just after 5.30pm on 29 December, it is reported that three men entered the Post Office on Church Street, Kimberworth, and threatened staff with knives. The staff in the shop fought off the men and they left empty-handed.

Less than an hour later, at 6.20pm, it is reported three men entered the Post Office on Far Lane in East Dene armed with knives. The men are reported to have forced their way behind the counter, assaulted the shop keeper and made off with a large quantity of cash.

Officers investigating the incidents believe the two robberies are linked and that the same men are responsible. Officers are keen to speak to the man in the CCTV image in connection to the incidents.

Do you recognise him? Do you have information that could help with officersâ€™ enquiries? Please call 101 quoting incident number 792 of 29 December 2020.
