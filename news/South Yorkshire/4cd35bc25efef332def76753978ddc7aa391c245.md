Detectives investigating an armed robbery at a Premier Store in Rotherham have issued an appeal for witnesses and information, as they work to track down those responsible.

At 9.30pm last night (14 December) itâ€™s reported that two men entered the shop in Rosegarth Avenue and threatened customers and staff with a suspected firearm. The men are said to have stolen money from the till before forcing their way upstairs where they stole more money and jewellery, from an adjacent flat.

The pair are both described as white, both wearing dark clothing and balaclavas.

Those involved were understandably left shaken by the incident and have been working closely with our officers today.

Detectives would like to hear from anyone who was in the area last night who witnessed the men, or captured them on their dash cam or CCTV.

You can report information through 101 by quoting incident number 944 of 14 December.

Alternatively, you can stay completely anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers via their website Crimestoppers-uk.org or by calling their UK Contact Centre on 0800 555 111.
