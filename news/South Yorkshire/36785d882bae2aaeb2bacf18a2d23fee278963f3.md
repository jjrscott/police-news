Our off-road bike team is appealing for information about the identity of a clown, after reports of dangerous driving and fleeing the scene of a collision.

On Halloween (Saturday 31 October), a man - dressed as a clown - was captured riding as part of a group of illegal off-road bikers across Sheffield and Rotherham.

At 12:26pm, one off road bike is said to have been involved in a collision with a grey Fiat Punto on Ashpool Close, Woodhouse. The rider fled the scene.

Weâ€™d now like to speak to the man in the costume, as we believe he can assist with our enquiries.

If you have any information that can help us, or dash-cam footage featuring this clown, please call 101 quoting incident number 407 of 31 October 2020.

Do you recognise who this could be?
