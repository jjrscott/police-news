Officers are appealing for witnesses and information after two police cars were set on fire Saturday 18 July.

Shortly before 11.30pm, a marked Ford Kuga police car was parked in a locked carpark when an unknown offender gained access and set it alight. The flames then spread to a Peugeot 308 that was parked nearby.

Both cars suffered extensive damage and have now been written off.

Inspector Matthew Wood said: "After reviewing CCTV footage, we have no doubt that this fire was started deliberately. This reckless act has resulted in two operational police cars being removed off the roads, meaning we now have less resources to respond to people when they need us.

"Thankfully no one was injured and we are now working hard to identify those responsible.

"If you were in the area on Saturday and witnessed anything suspicious, or can assist with our enquiries, please call 101 quoting incident number 1195 of 18 July.
