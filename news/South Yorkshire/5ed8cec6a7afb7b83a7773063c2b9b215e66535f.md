Over the last few weeks, our officers have received several reports of ‘fake postbox’ fraud at empty premises across South Yorkshire.

This activity involves offenders sealing up post or letterboxes at empty addresses and installing a new postbox to an external wall.

The scammers then apply for bank accounts, cards and loans and have the paperwork sent to the ‘fake postbox,’ which is only accessible to them.

PC Gavin Johnson from our Fraud Coordination Team said: “This type of fraudulent activity certainly involves an element of ‘organisation’, as criminals are identifying vulnerable properties in advance.

“We believe they are targeting rental properties, where tenants may have recently moved out, or houses that are standing empty, perhaps waiting for sale or auction.

“If you’re a landlord or property developer, we’d advise that you bear this warning in mind and keep an eye on your premises for any signs of damage or new fixtures or fittings that have appeared.”

If you have any concerns that your property might have been targeted, please call 101 or make a report online.

If you think you have been the victim of fraud you can report to Action Fraud at www.actionfraud.police.uk or 0300 123 2040.
