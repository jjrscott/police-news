Officers in Doncaster have released a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to in connection with a rape.

It is reported that at around 5am on 8 December 2019, a 24-year-old woman was raped at an address in Doncaster town centre.

Since the incident was reported to us, extensive enquiries have been carried out to locate the suspect, including trawling CCTV footage, identifying and speaking to witnesses and forensic work. An arrest was made in connection to the investigation but the individual was later eliminated from enquiries following extensive forensic work.

Officers are now asking for the public to help identify the man in this image as he may be able to assist with the ongoing enquiries. Do you recognise him?

If you have any information, please contact 101 quoting incident number 345 of 8 December 2019.

Alternatively, you can stay completely anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers via their website Crimestoppers-uk.org or by calling their UK Contact Centre on 0800 555 111.

Do you recognise this man?
