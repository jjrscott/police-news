Staff and officers across Barnsley have been busy creating food hampers to spread some Christmas cheer for those in need.

To give something back to the community after a challenging and uncertain year, Barnsley’s Tamara Craven proposed the idea to colleagues and has been overwhelmed by their generosity and support.

The hampers contain essential items, including toiletries and food, to ensure the most vulnerable in our communities have a meal over the Christmas period.

Tamara said: “After a difficult year I wanted to spread some cheer and help those without essentials to get by.

“The command team and staff from across Barnsley have provided items, officers from across the district have highlighted those in our communities who would benefit from the hampers.

“Any additional hampers will be donated to the local food bank.”

Christmas is a happy time for most people, but for some, it can be incredibly lonely and difficult.
Please be kind this Christmas. If you know someone who is struggling, please tell someone. There are plenty of local foodbanks and charities who are ready to help.
