Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a pursuit of a vehicle in Doncaster yesterday evening (Sunday 26 July 2020).

It is reported that at around 5:40pm, police were on patrol in Carr House Road in the Balby area when a silver Audi A4 failed to stop for officers.

The Audi was pursued by officers towards the Conisbrough area. During the pursuit the Audi collided with two cars and an ambulance. The driver and passenger of the ambulance suffered minor injuries.

The Audiâ€™s occupants, three men aged 19, 20 and 20, abandoned the vehicle and fled on foot in the Hooton Roberts area, where they were arrested a short time later on suspicion of dangerous driving and failing to stop for police.

An investigation has been launched and police now want to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you see what happened? Do you think you might have dash cam footage?

If you can help our officers in their enquiries, please call 101 quoting incident number 704 of 26 July 2020.
