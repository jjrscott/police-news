Police are appealing for witnesses after a couple were attacked by a dog in Hill Top Field, Conisbrough.

It is reported that on Monday 7 September at around 9:45pm the couple were walking their dog in the field when a second dog approached and attacked them.

Both victims suffered wounds to their hands and arms which required hospital treatment. Their dog was also seriously injured and had to undergo emergency surgery. The dog has sadly since passed away.

Police are asking for anyone who saw what happened to come forward.
