A man has appeared before Sheffield Crown Court and been sentenced to time in prison following a racially aggravated assault.

Steven Watson, 40, of Farm Road Barnsley was charged with racially aggravated assault following an incident in Barnsley Town Centre last year.

On 27 May 2020, officers from the Barnsley Central Neighbourhood Policing attended reports of an assault earlier in the day on Eldon Street North, around 4.15pm.

A man was walking along the street when he was approached by a group of unknown men, including Watson.

Watson assaulted the victim by punching him in his face, and made derogatory comments about the victim’s race.

Yesterday (16 February) Watson was sentenced to four months in prison and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £128, following his release.
