A man has been charged after an elderly couple were targeted in a reported distraction burglary in Sheffield on Monday (8 March).

Two men are said to have approached an address in Wadsley at around 10.15am and offered to make repairs to the occupants’ roof and guttering. When the woman refused, one of the men is alleged to have distracted her before stealing a large quantity of cash.

Wilf Mole, 42, has since been arrested and charged with burglary in connection with the incident.

He also faces burglary, criminal damage and fraud by misrepresentation charges in relation to a similar incident on 2 March.

Detective Sergeant Lee Corker said: “If someone approaches you and asks to carry out work on your property, please check their ID and do not accept work from people who come knocking on your door.

“Please be vigilant and report these types of incidents. If you have elderly or vulnerable friends, relatives or neighbours, please pass on this information. Anything suspicious should be reported to police.”

Mole, of Heath Road, Durham, has been remanded in to custody to appear before court later today (11 March).
