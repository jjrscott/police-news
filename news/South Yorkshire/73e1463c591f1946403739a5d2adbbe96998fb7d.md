Officers from Sheffield North Westâ€™s Walkley Team arrested a 33-year-old woman on suspicion of drugs offences, following a traffic stop on Penistone Road earlier this week.

On Tuesday 15 December, the neighbourhood team was carrying out a road safety operation when it is reported that a vehicle was stopped by officers for driving at speed. The vehicle was searched and a significant quantity of cash was recovered.

A 33-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of money laundering, possession with intent to supply drugs and driving while under the influence of drugs.

She has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
