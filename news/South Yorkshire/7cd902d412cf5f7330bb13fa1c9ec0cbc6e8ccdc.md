Two men have been sentenced to time behind bars for their part in a serious assault on Gell Street in Sheffield.

Samuel Moffatt, 32, of no fixed abode and Anthony Smith, 35, of Oakland Road both appeared before Sheffield Crown Court on Monday 19 Octoberafter being charged with S18 wounding with intent after an assault earlier this year.

The court heard how on 2 April at 7:30am, Moffatt and Smith attended a property on Gell Street in Sheffield.

The victim, a 32 year-old man, was seen on CCTV emerging from a property. As he left, he was attacked in the hall way of the block of flats.
The victim, who was known to the pair, was beaten with a spanner, crutch and pole. He was also stabbed. The victim sustained fractures to his ribs, injuries to his face and stab wounds to his chest and buttock. The stab wound in his chest was so severe that it punctured his lung.
The victim refused to engage with officers and a victimless investigation was launched. Officers conducted a number of enquiries including reviewing CCTV footage to ensure the offenders were brought to justice.
Investigating Officer DC Shaun Vine explains more, he said: “It is more difficult to progress a victimless crime but this was an incredibly serious assault, and it is our duty to protect the public.
“We worked hard to ensure that the pair were brought before the courts and I am pleased with the sentences passed today.
“We want this to be a strong message to organised criminals that you cannot cause fear among our communities, we will continue to prosecute you.”
Moffatt as sentenced to six years and eight months in prison for his charges and was sentenced an extra 28 months imprisonment to run consecutively for an unrelated drugs charged of possession with intent to supply a class A drug, totalling nine years in prison.
Smith was sentenced to six years and eight months.
