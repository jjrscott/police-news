Roads Policing Officers are appealing for witnesses, dash-cam footage and information following a road traffic collision in Rotherham.

Officers responded to reports of a collision between a pedestrian and motorbike on Wednesday 25 November on Centenary Way.

At 1.36pm, a black and silver Suzuki Sv650 motorbike was travelling along Centenary Way through the centre of stationary traffic. As the lights changed to green, itâ€™s believed he collided with a 49-year-old man, who was crossing the road at the pedestrian crossing from the direction of Drummond Street.

The pedestrian suffered injuries to his legs and face. He was taken to hospital by ambulance where he remains in a stable but serious condition. The motorcycle rider was uninjured and is assisting officers with their enquiries.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who may have witnessed the incident or have dash-cam footage of the pedestrian or motorcycle. If you can help please call 101 quoting incident number 433 of 25 November 2020. Any footage can be emailed through to enquiries@southyorks.pnn.police.uk.
