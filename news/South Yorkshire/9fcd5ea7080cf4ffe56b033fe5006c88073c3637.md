Officers in Sheffield have released CCTV images of a man they would like to speak to in connection with two armed robberies in the city centre.

It is reported that on 22 August at around 5.30am, a man was walking along Egerton Street when two men carrying an hatchet approached him and demanded his wallet.

When the victim refused, he was punched in the face. He was able to flee and reported what had happened to him to officers who were out on patrol.

It is then reported that at 6am, a further victim was approached on Norfolk Street by two men who tried to steal his watch. The victim was able to get away and the offenders fled in the direction of Arundel Gate.

On 1 September, a 19-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of robbery in connection to these incidents. He has since been released under investigation.

Enquiries are ongoing but officers are keen to identify the man in the images as he may be able to assist.

Do you recognise him?

If you have any information, please contact 101 quoting incident number 208 of 22 August, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
