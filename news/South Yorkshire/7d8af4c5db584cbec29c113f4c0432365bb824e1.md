Police are investigating after a boy was assaulted at Dearne Valley Country Park on Saturday afternoon (6 February).

It is reported that at around 4.40pm, a 14-year-old boy, was approached by a group of teenagers who attacked him and kicked him in the face.

Officers have spoken to a 15-year-old girl who attended a police station voluntarily in relation to the incident.

Superintendent Cherie Buttle said: “We are investigating what was a violent attack on a vulnerable young man in a very public space.

“We are aware that footage of this incident is being circulated on social media and I would like to reassure members of the local community and wider public that we are taking steps to identify those responsible.

“I’d like to appeal for anyone who saw what happened, or who has any information that might help our enquiries to please come forward.

“It might seem difficult to speak to us, but I’d encourage you to make contact – you can call 101 or submit an online report, please quote reference number 688 of 6 February.”
