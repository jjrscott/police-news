Officers from our Roads Policing Team are appealing for witnesses and information following an incident involving a 13-year-old girl and a horse in Doncaster.

It is reported that yesterday (9 February) a 13 year-old girl was riding her horse along Joan Croft Lane around 5pm when a car is believed to have driven past the horse too fast, causing it to bolt.

The girl fell from her horse and was taken to Sheffield Childrenâ€™s Hospital with serious head injuries.

The car involved is reported to be a white Seat Leon with dark tinted windows and dark wheels.

Officers are keen to speak to the driver of the car and anyone who may have witnessed the incident or live in the area and have CCTV footage.

Garages who have had similar cars in for damage repair are also urged to get in touch and assist with enquiries.

If you can help please call 101 quoting incident number 981 of 9 February 2021.
Dash-cam footage can be sent to enquiries@southyorks.pnn.police.uk with the incident number in the subject line.
