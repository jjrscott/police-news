Our proactive teams have taken over £40,000 worth of drugs off the streets of South Yorkshire this week, carrying out a series of targeted raids in Rotherham and Sheffield.

On Monday 30 November, the two districts carried out seven simultaneous warrants, recovering suspected cocaine with a street value of £10,000 and over £30,000 in cash from two of the addresses. Two men, aged 45 and 31, and a 30-year-old woman were all arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply and have since been released under investigation.

Less than 24 hours later, Rotherham officers and the force’s Tactical Support Group (TSG) carried out a further warrant in Church Street, Swinton. The pre-planned activity, carried out under the Misuse of Drugs Act, led to the discovery of £32,000 worth of suspected crack cocaine and heroin. Two men, aged 61 and 31, were arrested in connection with the find and have since been charged with drugs trafficking offences.

Terrence Hughes and Anthony Hughes, both of Church Street, were charged with possession with intent to supply heroin and crack cocaine. The pair will next appear before court on 6 January 2021.
