A man has been charged after a cannabis cultivation was discovered in the Worsbrough Common area of Barnsley yesterday.

Officers from our Operation Fortify team attended the address in Middlesex Street at around 3pm on Thursday 4 June to execute a warrant under the Misuse of Drugs Act.

243 cannabis plants with a street value of Â£100k were reportedly seized as part of the operation and a 43-year-old man was arrested at the scene.

Ilir Istrefaj, of no fixed abode, has since been charged with production of cannabis. He is set to appear before Magistrates today (Friday 5 June 2020)
