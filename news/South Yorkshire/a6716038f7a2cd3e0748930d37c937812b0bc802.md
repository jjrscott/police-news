We are appealing for witnesses to a collision which happened at around 10:30pm yesterday, (Saturday 9 May 2020) on the A638 close to junction 38.

It is reported that a grey Volkswagen Bora was travelling on the Doncaster bound dual carriageway when it collided with the rear of a Mercedes Sprinter flat-bed highways maintenance vehicle which was in the process of setting up road works.

Four of the five occupants of the Volkswagon, including the driver, fled the scene immediately. The front-passenger, a 32-year-old man, remained trapped.

The Fire Service, who attended the scene alongside police and paramedics, released the man and he was taken to hospital via ambulance to be treated for serious head injuries. He remains in hospital in a serious condition.

Police now want to speak to anyone who may have information about what happened. Did you see the vehicles before the collision? Did you witness what happened?

We are particularly interested in speaking to anyone who may have captured dash-cam footage of the incident.

If you can help, please call 101 and quote incident number 1212 of 9 May.
