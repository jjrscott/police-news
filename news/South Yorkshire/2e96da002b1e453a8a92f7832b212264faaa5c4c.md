We’ve launched an investigation after an armed robbery at a convenience store in Bentley, Doncaster on Sunday evening (20 December).

It’s reported that at 7pm, an unknown man entered the store, located in Askern Road, in possession of a knife and ordered the staff to open the till before he took around £300 in cash.

Witnesses have described him as being dressed in dark top and bottoms but wearing a yellow high vis vest with the words “2 METRES” written on the back, along with some arrows drawn on which looked to be in drawn in black marker pen.

It is believed he was wearing a black snood to cover his face and a black hat/hood. He was carrying a plastic carrier bag in dark green.

If you have any information which could help us progress our enquiries, please report this through 101 quoting investigation number 14/185826/20. We are also urging any drivers who travelled through the area on Sunday evening to check their dash cam footage to see if it captured the man either prior to or after the incident.

If you would prefer to remain anonymous, you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers in confidence, either via their website – www.crimestoppers-uk.org – or by calling their UK Contact Centre on 0800 555 111.
