Two Sheffield men have been charged with attempted murder after three people were injured following firearms discharges in the Manor area last week.

Bradley Jenkins, 27, of Waverley View, and Kai Smith, 18, of Villiers Close, were due to appear at Sheffield Magistrates’ Court today (13 January), each charged with two counts of attempted murder.

At around 8pm on 6 January, it is reported that shots were fired at three people - a 42-year-old woman, a 23-year-old man and a 28-year-old woman - who were stood outside a property on Castledale Croft on the Manor.

The 23-year-old man is believed to have fled on foot to nearby Prince of Wales Road and a couple of minutes later, police received reports of a second shotgun discharge at this location. The man, who suffered shotgun injuries to his arms and hand, is believed to have been targeted.

Two of the victims – the 23-year-old man and the 42-year-old woman - were taken to hospital to receive treatment. The 28-year-old woman suffered minor injuries which did not require medical treatment.
