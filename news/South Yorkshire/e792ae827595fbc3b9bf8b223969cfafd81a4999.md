We are appealing for information and witnesses after an incident of indecent exposure close to Don Valley Bowl Park in Sheffield earlier this week.

At around 5pm on Tuesday 23 February, officers were flagged down by a member of the public who reported that a man had exposed himself as she walked past him on a path, just off Coleridge Road, close to the tramlines.

PC Richard Norwood, investigating, said: “This was a really distressing incident for the victim, who has been left shaken and very upset by what happened on Tuesday.

“Officers carried out immediate enquiries on location and we are also reviewing CCTV footage.

“The victim has described the man as Asian and in his late 30s or early 40s, he was also thought to be wearing black jogging bottoms and a black puffer jacket.

“We know that there were a number of other people in the area at the time of the incident and I’d really like to hear from anyone who might have seen what happened or noticed anything unusual.”

If you can help with our enquiries, please contact 101 quoting crime reference number 14/34111/21 when you call. You can also make a report online, using our new portal or live chat.
