A man was arrested and a large quantity of suspected Class B drugs were seized after a warrant was executed at an address in Stanstead Abbotts.

Officers from the East Herts Operation Scorpion team carried out the action at a property in Sanville Gardens on Friday 15 January, with support from their Team 2 Intervention colleagues.

A large quantity of suspected cannabis - with an estimated street value of around Â£33,000 - was seized, along with cash and mobile phones.

A 20-year-old man was arrested and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

PC Trainor, from the East Herts Operation Scorpion team said: "This operation was carried out as a direct result of feedback from members of the public who had voiced their concerns about drug dealing in the area.

"There is often a lot of criticism directed at police when these kinds of warrants are carried out, suggesting that our efforts should be focused elsewhere. However, what some people don't realise is that drugs can often be the catalyst for more serious and violent crimes, which cause real fear and concern among the local community. This is simply unacceptable and no one should have to live that way.

"I hope this action shows that we are listening to the concerns of residents and will do whatever we can to target those who are involved in criminal activity. If you're dealing drugs in East Herts, we're probably already watching you."
