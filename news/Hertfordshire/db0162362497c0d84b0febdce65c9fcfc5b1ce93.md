* ### Officers on routine patrol arrest a man for interfering with motor vehicles in St Albans.

 * ### He is due in court next month.

 * ### Lock your car, double check you have locked it and do not leave anything on display.

A 23-year-old man was arrested yesterday morning on suspicion of interfering with motor vehicles in St Albans.

Kane Dixon, from Russet Drive, was stopped by officers on routine patrol at 2am in Elm Avenue. He was subsequently charged with interfering with three motor vehicles on Tuesday May 15 and another similar offence in Rodney Avenue at 1.20am on April 30.

He appeared in Hatfield yesterday and has been given court bail until his next appearance in Central Herts Court (Hatfield) on Monday June 18.

St Albans Detective Inspector Alex Warwick said: "We have had dozens of thefts from motor vehicles reported to us over the past few months. The best way to significantly reduce this is to make sure you **lock your car, double check you have locked it and do not leave anything on display** , including loose change. Please call us on 999 if you see anyone acting suspiciously around vehicles - or 101 if you are reporting it retrospectively."
