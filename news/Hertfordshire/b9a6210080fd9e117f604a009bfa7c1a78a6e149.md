Officers are appealing for the public's help to trace a man who is wanted.

James Connors, aged 32, from Ripple Road Barking, is wanted in connection with an assault which occurred in Winterscroft Road, Hoddesdon, on Thursday, May 17. The offender and victim are known to each other.

Anyone who sees him or knows of his whereabouts is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference K1/18/1227 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/report.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
