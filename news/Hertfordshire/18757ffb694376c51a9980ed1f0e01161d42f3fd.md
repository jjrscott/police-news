Police investigating a sexual assault in St Albans have released an e-fit of a suspect they would like to identify.

A woman aged in her 20s was walking from St Albans railway station just before midnight on Thursday, April 11 when she realised a man was following her onto Victoria Street. He walked beside her and started talking to her in Lattimore Road before grabbing her arm and trying to kiss her.

PC Laura Richardson said: "The victim repeatedly told the male 'No' and pushed him away but was understandably very shaken up by this incident. We are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen what happened. I believe there may be a number of witnesses as other people were leaving the station at the same time that night.

"If anyone recognises the man pictured please help us identify him as he may have information which could assist the investigation.

"If you were in the area around the time, please contact me on _laura.richardson2@herts.pnn.police.uk_ or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/33154/19."
