The family of Joy Morgan are re-appealing for anyone who has information to get in touch.

Joy, a 21 year old University of Hertfordshire midwifery student, was reported missing from Hatfield on Thursday, February 7. She was last seen in Ilford on December 26, 2018.

On Wednesday, February 27, Shohfah-El Israel, aged 40, of Fordwych Road, London, was charged with murder. Joy's body has not yet been found and enquiries are on-going.

Today (Wednesday, April 3), Joy's mother Carol said: "Our beautiful Joy is so loved by us and we are living a nightmare not knowing where she is.

"We cannot come to terms with what has happened. The situation is unbearable. Joy turned 21 on February 12 and we should have been able to celebrate with her.

"Please, if you have any information at all that will help the police, get in touch. I cannot say it enough - just please, please get in touch and help us."

Officers are still keen to hear from anyone who has information about the pictured Honda vehicle which belongs to Israel.

Detective Inspector Justine Jenkins, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: "The vehicle has been located but I am keen to hear from anyone who might have seen it over the festive period and into the New Year. Joy used to travel in the vehicle and any information you have about it, no matter how small it might seem, could be vital to the investigation.

"If you saw it, please do not hesitate to get in touch and let us know when and where it was."

Joy had links to Hatfield, Ilford, Battersea, Cricklewood, Stevenage and Luton.
