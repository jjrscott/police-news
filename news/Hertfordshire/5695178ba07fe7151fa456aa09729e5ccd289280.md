Officers investigating an incident of indecent exposure in Bishop's Stortford are appealing for witnesses and information.

PC Kevin Gibbs from the East Herts Safer Neighbourhood Team, who is investigating, said: "We'd like to speak to anyone who was in the area around the time of the incident and may have information that can assist the investigation.

"We have carried out extensive enquiries in our efforts to identify this individual and now I am appealing for the public's help."

Anyone who recognises him is asked to contact PC Gibbs by emailing: kevin.gibbs@herts.pnn.police.uk, submitting information online at: herts.police.uk/report or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 400 of 8/11/19.
