Officers have released an image of a rare coin that was stolen during a burglary in a bid to trace it.

Between 5.30pm on Monday 28 May and 9.30am on Tuesday 29 May, offender(s) gained entry to a house in Stratford Way, Watford, and conducted an untidy search.

Several items were taken from the property, including a rare coin.

DC Julie Vint, who is investigating, said: "The coin, known as the F.R. Botham Award, was awarded to the victim for voluntary services to the Institute of Baths and Recreational Management and understandably it means a lot to them."

"I am appealing to anyone who has information about where the coin is, or believes they might have been offered it for sale, to get in touch.

"Similarly, I would like to appeal to anyone who might have witnessed anything suspicious in the area around the time of the burglary to make contact with me.

"Any information you can give me, no matter how small it might seem, could be vital in our investigation and in tracing the stolen coin."

Any witnesses, or anyone with information, should contact DC Vint on julie.vint@herts.pnn.police.uk or on the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/2644/18.
