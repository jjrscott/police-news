Officers are appealing for information and witnesses following three incidents of criminal damage to vehicles in Letchworth.

Between 11pm on Wednesday, October 31 and 3.15am on Thursday, November 1, offender(s) smashed the wing mirror of a Volkswagen Transporter that was parked in Baldock Road. Offender(s) also damaged a car cover on an Audi TT (crime reference 41/51799/18).

Shortly after midnight on Thursday, November 1, damage was also caused to a third vehicle in Baldock Road. Three males wearing hoods smashed the wing mirror of a silver Volvo V50. Police were called and attended the scene but the offenders made off (crime reference 41/51820/18).

All three vehicles were parked on the stretch of Baldock Road between the BP garage and St Paul's Church.

PCSO Natasha Angwin said: "I am appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time and saw what happened, or saw suspicious activity, to get in touch with me. Any information you have, no matter how small it might seem, could be vital in helping us trace those responsible.

"If you can help, please call the non-emergency number 101 or email me at _natasha.angwin@herts.pnn.police.uk_ quoting the relevant crime reference. You can also report information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report."

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
