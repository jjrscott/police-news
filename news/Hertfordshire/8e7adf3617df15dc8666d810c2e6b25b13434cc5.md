Elderly residents in Ware are being invited to attend a special event organised by Herts Fire and Rescue Service and Hertfordshire Constabulary, at Ware Priory on Tuesday June 19.

The Older Person Activity Learning and Safety (OPALS) event is aimed at helping elderly residents stay safe and active in later life.

The event will run from 10am to 2pm and will feature a number of key speakers from Hertfordshire Constabulary, Neighbourhood Watch, Herts Fire and Rescue, Trading Standards, the Red Cross, the Hertford Independent Living Services, Hertfordshire County Council Road Safety and Age UK. They will cover topics ranging from fire safety, staying safe and crime prevention advice, first aid and keeping active and social.

Refreshments, including a free hot lunch, will be provided by Herts Independent Living Service.

Neighbourhood Watch Liaison Officer Terry Morris from Hertfordshire Constabulary said: "This is a great event, which we hope will be well attended. The speakers will chat for around 15 minutes on their given topics and then invite questions and discussions allowing for a much more informal and interactive event.

"Covering so many different topics by different agencies in one day is very productive, as many elderly residents find it hard to get out and about to separate events."

If you would like to attend please contact Terry Morris on 01707 355815 or email: wlo@herts.pnn.police.uk
