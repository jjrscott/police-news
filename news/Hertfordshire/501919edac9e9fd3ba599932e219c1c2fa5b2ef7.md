Officers investigating a sexual assault in Buntingford have released an image of a person they would like to speak to as part of their enquiries.

It happened in an alleyway between White Hart Close and the High Street between 7.30pm and 8.30pm on Sunday, February 11.

A woman, aged in her 20s, was walking down the alleyway when a male offender approached her from behind and touched her inappropriately.

He ran off from the scene in the direction of Nevetts care home on White Hart Close.

PC Kayleigh Piper, who is investigating, said: "I appreciate that the quality of the CCTV image is less than ideal, but the person's build and clothing is quite distinctive, and they are seen to be walking a dog.

"If you think you may know the identity of the person pictured, or have any further information that could assist the investigation, please email me at kayleigh.piper2@herts.pnn.police.uk, report information online at www.herts.police.uk/report or call 101, quoting crime reference number A5/18/109."
