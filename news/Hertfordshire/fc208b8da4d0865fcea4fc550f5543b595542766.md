Police are re-appealing for the public's help to trace a woman who has been reported missing from St Albans.

Modelene Wobidike, aged 39, was last seen in the city centre at 3.50pm on Saturday 22 August.

She is described as black, of medium build and 5ft 2in tall.

Modelene was last seen wearing a black dress. She often wears a headscarf, and ornate jewellery such as bangles and rings.

Officers are growing increasingly concerned for her welfare.

Jenny Brown, manager of the force's Locate team, said: "We have made extensive enquiries in order to locate Modelene but so far these have proved unsuccessful.

"Modelene is vulnerable and lives a transient lifestyle, meaning she has links to Watford, South London, Central London and the West End, as well as Horley and Reigate in Surrey.

"We are doing all we can to trace her so we can ensure she is safe and well. Please get in touch if you have any information."

If you believe you are with Modelene now or have seen her in the last few moments, please call 999 immediately quoting reference 473 of 22 August.

If you have seen Modelene since she was reported missing or have information about where she may have been, please call Hertfordshire Constabulary's non-emergency line on 101.
