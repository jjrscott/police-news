Five 15-year-old boys have been found guilty of the murder of teenager Jacob Abraham at St Albans Crown Court this afternoon (Monday, June 25).

Jacob, aged 15, was fatally stabbed in a service road behind Hurst Drive, Waltham Cross, on the evening of December 7, 2017.

Detective Chief Inspector Jerome Kent, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, and said: "This has been a distressing investigation for all involved due to the age of both the victim and the offenders.

"I am extremely pleased with today's result and I hope it gives Jacob's family a small sense of reassurance that justice has been done, though we know nothing will ever compensate for their unimaginable loss."

The five boys, who cannot be named for legal reasons, are due to be sentenced on July 27.
