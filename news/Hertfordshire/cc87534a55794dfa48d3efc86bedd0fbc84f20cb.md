* ### Appeal for witnesses to racially aggravated offence

 * ### Children's play area daubed with racist words and symbols

 * ### Please get in touch if you saw anything suspicious

On Saturday 23 November between 9.30am and 1.25pm offenders painted racist words and symbols on equipment in the children's play area at Moatfield Recreation Ground, in Bournehall Lane, using orange and blue spray paint.

Hate crime officer PC Andrea Haughton, who is investigating, said: "This sort of behaviour has no place in Hertfordshire and we are doing all we can to trace the offenders. The park is always busy at the weekends and I am hoping someone will have seen the perpetrators daubing these appalling words and symbols on the play equipment.

"I am urging any witnesses or anyone with information to get in touch. If you can help, please call the non-emergency number 101 or email me at _andrea.haughton@herts.pnn.police.uk_ quoting crime reference 41/105743/19."
