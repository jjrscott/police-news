Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a man who is wanted.

Levi George, aged 24 from Hallwicks Road, Luton, is wanted for drug offences in Hertfordshire.

He is believed to frequent the Luton, Stevenage and North Herts areas.

Anyone who sees Levi or knows of his whereabouts is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/61740/19 or report information online.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form
