Officers investigating a burglary in Baldock are appealing for information and witnesses.

The burglary happened in Icknield Way on Wednesday, October 31 between 7.30pm and 8pm.

During this time, a group of four offenders gained access to an industrial unit and took gardening equipment including lawnmowers and strimmers. The offenders were all wearing hoods, with one also wearing a black and white chequered deerstalker style hat.

They are understood to have been using a white Transit van which had two square shaped marks on the rear.

PC Katie Golledge, who is investigating, said: "I am appealing for anyone who might have seen suspicious activity in the area at the time to get in touch.

"The location of the offence is very close to Ivel Springs which is popular with dog walkers. It's likely that there would have been dog walkers passing by who might have seen suspicious activity.

"The items that were taken were all Stihl and orange and white. If you think you might have been offered them for sale, please also get in contact.

"If you can help, please call the non-emergency number 101 or email me at katie.golledge@herts.pnn.police.uk, quoting crime reference 41/51883/18."
