'Don't chance it, check it' is the message from the team responsible for reducing casualties and keeping us safe on the roads across Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire.

October is tyre safety month and officers from the tri-force Road Policing Unit will be carrying out checks of tyres as part of their routine proactive casualty reduction patrols.

Low tread, poor condition, damage, over inflated tyres and low pressure are all issues. The recommendation is to check these factors at least once a month and particularly before long journeys.

CI Chris Treadwell said: "Ineffective tyres do cause accidents and by keeping a check on them regularly it really could save lives. It doesn't take long and we would encourage all drivers to routinely check them.

"Accurate tyre pressures not only ensure the vehicle handles correctly, it also reduces the chances of a sudden deflation and helps to save fuel."

**Things you need to know:**

You could face a fine of up to Â£2,500 and three penalty points per defective tyre.
