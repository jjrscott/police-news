**A man wanted in connection the rape and abduction of two women in London has been arrested in Cheshire and is now being investigated for further offences.
**

 * Wanted man Joseph McCann arrested.
 * He was arrested in Cheshire this morning.
 * The investigation is being led by the Met police.

Officers from the Metropolitan Police launched an urgent investigation and a series of detailed public appeals to trace 34-year-old Joseph McCann who they had identified as someone they needed to speak with following the rape and abduction of two women in London.

On Sunday, 5 May, detectives were informed that McCann had been located in the Congleton area of Cheshire. He was arrested in the early hours of Monday, 6 May and taken into police custody.

**DCI Katherine Goodwin from the Met 's Homicide and Major Crime Command said:** "Between Sunday, 21 April and Saturday, 5 May McCann is suspected to have been involved in a number of attacks across different parts of the country.

"I can confirm he is now being investigated for offences committed in Cheshire, Manchester and Lancashire in addition to London and Hertfordshire.

"Detectives from the Met continue to lead on this investigation and are working very closely with policing counterparts where he is suspected to have carried out further offences. These offences will be jointly investigated.

"At this early stage, there are believed to be nine further victims following the attacks in Hertfordshire and London. These attacks were grotesque and horrifying. These victims are now being supported by specialist officers. Further details concerning specific offences will become clearer in due course.

"I would urge any other victims to come forward. We also need to hear from anyone who has been approached or been in contact with McCann between February and May.

"Anyone who can help is asked to call the incident room on 020 8785 8244. Alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously via 0800 555 111."

Since the investigation commenced, details of McCann, including his image, offending history and the risk he posed to members of the public were circulated nationally to all police forces as detectives worked around the clock to bring him in for questioning. He was shown as wanted on the Police National Computer immediately with the Met's Homicide and Major Crime Command leading the investigation from the outset.

Searches of associated addresses were also completed throughout the country in close partnership with other police forces. McCann's image and a Â£20,000 **police reward** for information leading to his arrest and conviction were quickly issued in a media appeal. The vehicle involved in the initial offences was also circulated via the ANPR system as part of an in depth and fast-moving investigation.
