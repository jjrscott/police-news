Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a man who is wanted.

Charlie Shillibeer, aged 26, whose last known address is in Sawbridgeworth, is wanted in connection with failing to appear at Stevenage Magistrates' Court and breach of bail conditions.

He also has connections to Luton and Bourne in Lincolnshire.

Anyone who sees Charlie or knows of his whereabouts is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/10121/19 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
