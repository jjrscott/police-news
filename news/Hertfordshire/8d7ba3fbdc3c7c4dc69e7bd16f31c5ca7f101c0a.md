* ### Dog Handler pays tribute to his former Police Dog

 * ### Nero sadly passed away this week

 * ### The two served together for six years

PC Clive Warncken of the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Dog Unit has today (25 July) paid tribute to former police dog Nero who sadly died this week.

"Nero was a lovely dog and a great colleague and I loved working with him. I am devastated by the news," said PC Warncken.

Nero and Clive worked together for six years before Nero had to retire having suffered a broken neck and other injuries whilst on duty in Watford on 21 July 2016. The pair had been deployed to a report of a robbery. Clive saw the offenders and sent Nero to chase and detain them. They jumped a fence and Nero followed but unfortunately it wasn't known that there was a 10 to 12 foot drop on the other side.

PC Warncken said: "I had desperately hoped he would make a full recovery but with his health and wellbeing being paramount the decision was made to retire him. I am grateful for the years we spent together and will miss him."
