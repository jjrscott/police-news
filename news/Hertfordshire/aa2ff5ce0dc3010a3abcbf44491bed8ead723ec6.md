* ### Partial closure order to prevent disruption to residents

 * ### Police and council worked together

 * ### Order in place for three months

A partial closure order was issued by police at an address in Ladies Grove, St Albans, on Tuesday morning (24 September).

Sergeant Mike Saunders, from the Community Safety Unit, said: "We worked closely with St Albans City and District Council to apply for the closure order as we believe the tenants were causing disruption to residents in Ladies Grove.

"We were able to prove that the occupants of Ladies Grove have been involved in criminal behaviour at this property and therefore the court, under the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014, put the partial closure order on.

"This means that only the tenant and one other named person, the council and the emergency services are able to enter the address for three months until Christmas (23 December 2019). A breach of the order is a criminal offence under the Anti-Social Behaviour Crime and Policing Act 2014."

Before the order was issued, officers carried out a warrant at the address on Thursday 15 August.

A 57 year old woman was arrested on suspicion of fraud and being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs on 15 August. This was in relation to fraudulently obtaining Â£900 worth of meat from a butcher.

A 43 year old man and a 31 year old woman were also arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs.

They are on police bail until Thursday 12 December 2019.

Wraps, believed to be drugs, were seized from the property.
