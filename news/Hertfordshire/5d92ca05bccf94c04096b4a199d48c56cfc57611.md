Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a teenager who has gone missing from Watford.

Sibhosami Banda, known as Sammy, is 19 years old and went missing from central Watford at around 2pm today when she was seen getting into a taxi near to Watford General Hospital.

Sammy, who lives in London Colney, is described as being black, of medium build with blue braided hair. She has a nose piercing and was last seen wearing grey jogging style trousers and a black crop top.

Officers are growing increasingly concerned for Sammy's welfare. Anyone who has seen her or believes they known where she is should contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101. If you are with Sammy now or have been with her in the last few moments please call 999.
