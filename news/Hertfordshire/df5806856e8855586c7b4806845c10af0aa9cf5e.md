Officers are appealing for information and witnesses following a serious collision in Watford yesterday (Wednesday, January 16).

The incident happened at around 7.05pm in Second Avenue.

A grey Volkswagen Transporter was in collision with three stationary vehicles - a black Vauxhall Zafira, a white Volkswagen Transporter and a Ford Transit.

The driver, a man in his 50s, was taken to hospital and remains in a serious condition.

PC James Wood from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit, said: "I would like to hear from anyone who saw the collision, including the events leading up to it, and anyone who has other information that can help with the investigation.

"Similarly, if you have dash cam footage you think may be useful, I would like you to get in touch. If you can help please contact me on the non-emergency number 101 or through email at _james.wood@herts.pnn.police.uk_ , quoting ISR 690 of January 16."
