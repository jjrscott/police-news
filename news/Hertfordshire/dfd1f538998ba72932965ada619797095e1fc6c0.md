The family of Lee Manners, who died in a road traffic collision near Croxley Green, has paid tribute to him.

The 24 year old from Croxley Green sadly lost his life following the collision on Sarratt Road around 9.15pm on Monday 4 November. No other vehicles were involved.

Lee had always lived in Croxley Green and after working at Heathrow Airport for several years he recently achieved his boyhood dream of qualifying as a commercial pilot.

A statement from Lee's family said: "Lee was a much loved son/brother and he will be dearly missed by his heartbroken family and friends.

"Lee had always lived in Croxley Green where he attended the local schools and played for Croxley Guild Cricket Club.

"He was also a keen golfer and enjoyed the challenge of playing at lots of different courses.

"Everyone who knew Lee spoke of his huge smile and his sense of humour.

"The family have been overwhelmed by the cards, flowers and messages and would like to thank everyone for their support."
