Officers investigating a burglary in Hemel Hempstead have released an image of two rings that were among the items stolen.

It happened in Marriotts Way sometime between Thursday, June 7 and Wednesday, June 13.

Offender(s) gained entry to the rear garden before smashing a patio door. They searched the property before taking a large amount of jewellery.

This included the victim's wedding and engagement rings, pictured. They are both 18ct gold and of a distinctive design. Both have been cut due to the victim having to have them removed following a road traffic collision.

Investigator Lisa Brown, from the Dacorum Local Crime Unit, said: "The items taken were of sentimental value and I am doing all I can to trace those responsible. Did you see or hear anything suspicious in the area between the dates stated? Have you seen the rings pictured?

"If you have any information at all, please email me, report online or by calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/7674/18."
