* ### Two Plate Safe events have been scheduled in Watford in the coming weeks

 * ### Get your vehicle registration plates fitted with anti-tamper screws, as well as meet your local neighbourhood officers and receive home security advice

 * ### The first event is at Asda on the Dome Roundabout on June 23, and the second is at Tesco on Lower High Street on July 6

Officers from the Watford Outer Safer Neighbourhood Team will be holding two free Plate Safe events in the coming weeks.

Drivers will be able to get anti-tamper screws fitted to their vehicle's number plates in order to help prevent them from being stolen.

The first event will be held in the Asda supermarket car park on the Dome Roundabout, Watford, WD24 7RT, between 10am and 1.30pm on Sunday, June 23.

The second event will take place in Tesco supermarket car park in Lower High Street, Watford, WD17 2BD, between 10am and 1.30pm on Saturday, July 6.

Theft of car number plates can be hugely inconvenient and they can subsequently be used by criminals for offences such as bilking (theft of petrol) or evading speed camera fines.

It takes just minutes for the screws to be fitted and the service is completely free of charge.

The events are also a great opportunity to meet your local Safer Neighbourhood Team officers and discuss any local policing issues.

Officers will also be giving out home security and crime prevention advice to help drivers keep their vehicles more secure from opportunist thieves.
