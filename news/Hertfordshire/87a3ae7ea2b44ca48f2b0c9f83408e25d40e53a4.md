Two pieces of graffiti - the latest one racially motivated - have been reported to police at the same block of flats in Bushey.

The latest one which had an anti-Semitic reference happened overnight between 10pm and 7am yesterday morning (Wednesday May 2) at the communal address in Ivinghoe Road.

A week ago, another offensive message was left on the communal door between 11pm on Tuesday April 24 and 8am on Wednesday April 25.

"This kind of racially aggravated graffiti and criminal damage will not be tolerated in Bushey," said PC Gerard Handscombe. "We are investigating the two incidents and would appeal to anyone with any information to call police so we can put a stop to this before it escalates."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police on 101 quoting crime reference J2/18/570.
