* ### Children from Markyate School had to solve a series of clues.

 * ### They enlisted the help of their local PCSO.

 * ### The day was a great success.

Youngsters in Markyate enlisted the help of a local Police Community Support Officer to help solve a mystery at their school.

The children from Markyate School, aged three to five years, were tasked with tracing a 'naughty red bus' which had gone missing after doing various mischievous things such as making a mess in the kitchen, driving across the field and leaving muddy tyre tracks.

They had to solve a series of clues, with help from PCSO Nigel Haggar, to discover the whereabouts of the bus.

"It was all a lot of fun," said PCSO Haggar. "The children were really enthusiastic and worked well together. Who knows, we may have even discovered some future detectives!

"It's really important for us to get out into the local community and engage with people of all ages. This event was a great way to interact with the children and build some positive relationships between them and the police."
