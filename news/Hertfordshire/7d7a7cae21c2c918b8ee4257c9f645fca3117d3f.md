Officers and Staff from Stevenage Police Station have been supporting the East and North Hertfordshire Hospitals' Toy and Gift Appeal.

Their donations will be provided to children and elderly patients who will be in hospital over the Christmas period.

Neighbourhood Sergeant Duncan Hall (together with his elves) delivered the donations to the Lister Hospital where they were gratefully received.
