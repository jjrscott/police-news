 * ### Feedback will be used to help shape initiatives and campaigns going forward.

Officers from the East Herts Rural Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT) will be holding an engagement event in Buntingford next week.

The socially-distanced event on Wednesday (12 August) will allow people to meet with officers, to discuss any issues they feel police should be focusing their efforts on locally.

The feedback will be recorded via the Constabulary's community voice platform echo and will be used to help shape neighbourhood priorities, initiatives and campaigns moving forward.

Officers will be stationed at the junction of Church Street and the High Street, between noon and 2pm.

PCSO Paul Dearman, who has organised the event, said: "Feedback from members of the public is really important to us, as it enables us to gauge the issues which are important to people locally. Please do pop along and say hello and tell us what matters most to you."

If you are unable to attend the event you can still give your feedback by visiting bit.ly/herts-echo or bit.ly/police-bunters
