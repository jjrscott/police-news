Officers have released a CCTV image of two men they would like to speak to as part of their enquiries following an attempted burglary in Whitwell.

On Sunday, May 26, offenders attempted to gain entry into a flat in High Street.

Detective Constable Kerry Burrows from the North Herts Local Crime Unit said: "We'd like to speak to the two men pictured as we believe they were in the area around the time of the incident and may have information that can assist our investigation.

"If you recognise them or have any information that could help us please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact DC Burrows via email at kerry.burrows@herts.pnn.police.uk, report information online, speak to an operator in our Force Communications Room via our online web chat, which can be launched here or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/47477/19.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form.
