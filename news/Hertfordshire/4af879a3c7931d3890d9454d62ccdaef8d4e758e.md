Police are appealing for information and witnesses following a burglary in Watford.

Between 5.20pm and 6.15pm on Friday, February 16, offender(s) gained entry to a house in St Matthews Close and conducted an untidy search.

Jewellery was taken from the property and the offender(s) are believed to have left the scene in a grey vehicle.

Detective Constable Matt Cox, who is investigating, said: "The jewellery that was taken was sentimental to the victim. I am appealing for witnesses who may have seen any suspicious activity in the area between the times stated to get in touch.

"Were you in in the area at the time? Did you see a grey vehicle there?

"Any information you have, no matter how insignificant it may seem, could be vital to the investigation."

Anyone with information should contact DC Cox on matthew.cox@herts.pnn.police.uk or the non-emergency number 101 , quoting crime reference C1/18/946. You can also report information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report .

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
