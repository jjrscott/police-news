"It's only a matter of time before someone is seriously injured - or worse," said PC Andy Shepherd from the _St Albans Central, North and West Safer Neighbourhood Team_ following teenagers cycling dangerously in and out of traffic, towards taxi drivers, doing wheelies and being towed by buses in St Albans city centre.

He said: "I think parents would be shocked seeing the danger these cyclists are putting themselves and other road users and pedestrians in. We hope that by issuing CCTV footage of the cyclists, we can help prevent accidents by encouraging parents to speak to their children and let us know who the teenagers are so we can help prevent this kind of behaviour. We are also working with schools to try and keep these young people and St Albans residents safe."

Most of the offences have occurred in St Peter's Street and Victoria Street, which have been caught on St Albans City and District Council CCTV footage. They will continue to support police by providing CCTV footage.

You can view the footage via YouTube.
