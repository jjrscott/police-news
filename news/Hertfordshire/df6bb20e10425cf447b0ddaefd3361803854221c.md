Officers from the Welwyn Hatfield South Safer Neighbourhood Team took part in the annual May Fayre and Food Festival in Newgate Street on Sunday (May 19).

Hosting a stall at the event, officers were on hand to give out crime prevention advice and encourage residents to sign up to Neighbourhood Watch.

PCSO Deborah Rogers said: "It was great to meet so many residents and the children had a great time sitting in the police cars.

"If you haven't already signed up to Neighbourhood Watch, you can do this easily at OWL. It's a useful way to make sure you're up-to-date with what's happening in the local area. You'll receive emails about crime, missing people and other relevant information."
