Police are appealing for information and witnesses following a serious road traffic collision in St Albans.

Just before 2pm today (November 2), a cyclist was involved in a collision with a red Honda Civic car in Sandpit Lane, St Albans.

The cyclist - a woman aged in her 60s - was taken to hospital with serious injuries. The driver of the car - a man - was not injured.

The road was closed while emergency services dealt with the incident and was re-opened at around 5.10pm.

Sergeant Will Hood from the Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire Road Policing Unit said: "We are working to establish the exact circumstances surrounding this collision and I would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident and has not yet spoken to police. If you have a dash cam fitted in your vehicle and believe you may have footage that could assist our investigation please also contact me as soon as possible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Sgt Hood by emailing william.hood@herts.pnn.police.uk , calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting ISR 406 of November 2 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
