A 38-year-old man from Watling Street, St Albans, was sentenced to 30 weeks imprisonment at St Albans Crown Court last Wednesday (October 12) after pleading guilty to assaulting a police officer.

William Saunders was arrested in Watling Street on December 7, 2016 after he hit a police officer on the head with the handle of a broom, causing her to lose consciousness. The incident happened when police officers were making investigations in the local area.

Saunders was promptly arrested following in the incident. Although shaken, thankfully the officer was not seriously injured.

**Detective Inspector John Hazeldine, who leads Welwyn Hatfield 's Local Crime Unit, said:** "We will not tolerate assaults on our officers who are doing everything they can to keep the residents of Hertfordshire safe. I am very pleased with the outcome of this sentencing and I hope that it serves as a warning to anyone who considers attacking our officers in future."
