A man has been summoned to court in connection with a hare coursing offence, following an investigation by Hertfordshire Constabulary's Rural Operational Support Team (ROST).

Police were called on the afternoon of Monday 4 January following an incident on private land off London Road in Hitchin.

It was alleged that several sight hounds had been used to pursue game on the land, contrary to section 30 of the Game Act 1831.

A 32-year-old man was subsequently arrested.

He was released on bail and has been summoned to appear before Stevenage Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 5 May.
