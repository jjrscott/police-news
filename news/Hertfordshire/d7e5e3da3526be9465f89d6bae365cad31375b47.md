A 17-year-old boy from Stevenage was arrested after officers spotted him behaving suspiciously in the town on Sunday, June 16.

At around 6.15pm officers saw two teenagers in Silam Road and asked them to stop. However one of the boys ran off and one was seen to discard an item under a car whilst being pursued.

Officers apprehended the teen and recovered a machete- style knife from under the vehicle. A quantity of drugs was also found on the boy.

He has been released under investigation whilst inquiries continue.
