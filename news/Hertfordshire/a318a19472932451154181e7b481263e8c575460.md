Police are appealing for the public's help to trace the woman pictured in this photograph.

Officers are concerned for the welfare of the woman, who was last seen at the Holiday Inn hotel in Apsley, Hemel Hempstead, at around 9.35am Thursday, October 26.

She is described as around 5ft 1in tall and with black hair. She is believed to be Romanian.

Detective Sergeant Vickie Coleman said: "The woman is not in any trouble. We would like to trace her to check her welfare. Anyone who has seen the woman or who knows of her whereabouts should call us on 101 as soon as possible."
