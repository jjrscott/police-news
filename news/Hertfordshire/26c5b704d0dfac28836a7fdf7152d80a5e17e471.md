Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a teenage boy who has gone missing from Stevenage.

Jake Moore, aged 15, was last seen in the Broadwater area of the town at 5.30pm yesterday evening (Friday, November 30).

He is described as slim, with fair skin and dark brown hair.

He was last seen wearing a black cap, black tracksuit bottoms and black and white Nike trainers with a dark-coloured hoodie and puffa jacket.

Officers are growing increasingly concerned for Jake's welfare.

If you have seen him since he was reported missing or have information about where he may have been, please call Hertfordshire Constabulary's non-emergency number 101.

If you believe you are with Jake now or have seen him in the last few moments, please call 999 immediately.
