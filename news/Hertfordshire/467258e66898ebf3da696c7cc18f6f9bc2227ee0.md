Officers are appealing for the public's help to trace a man who is wanted.

Jasper Thomson, age 25 of Icknield Way, Letchworth Garden City, is wanted in connection with failing to appear at court in relation to an assault. He is also wanted on recall to prison.

Thomson has links to Hitchin, Letchworth Garden City and the Highbury area of London.

Anyone who sees Thomson or has information about his whereabouts is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101.

You can also report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report or speak to an operator in our Force Communications Room via our online web chat, which can be launched here: herts.police.uk/contact.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
