Photographs of jewellery stolen in a burglary in St Albans have been released by police in a bid to trace the property and identify the offenders.

"If you recognise this distinctive jewellery or have been offered it for sale, please get in touch as soon as possible," said Detective Constable Paul Edmondson.

A number of rings, necklaces, three watches, a gold bracelet and a town crier pendant (all pictured) were stolen from an address in Watford Road sometime between 12pm and 5pm on Saturday, March 30.

Any witnesses or anyone with information should contact DC Edmondson on paul.edmondson@herts.pnn.police.uk or the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/30131/19. You can also report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report
