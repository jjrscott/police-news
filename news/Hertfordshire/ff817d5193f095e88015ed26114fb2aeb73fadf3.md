"I would like to speak to the man pictured as I believe he was in the area at the time of the incident and may have information that could assist the on-going investigation.

"I'd ask anyone who recognises him to contact me by emailing, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference A1/18/1112, or report information online.

"Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form.No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court."
