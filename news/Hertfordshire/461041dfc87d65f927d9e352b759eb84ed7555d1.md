Police investigating an affray in Ware are continuing to appeal for witnesses to come forward.

At around 9.45pm on Wednesday, 19 June an altercation occurred between a group of people on the bridge near the Saracens Head pub, before continuing into Amwell End.

No one has reported being injured at this time.
