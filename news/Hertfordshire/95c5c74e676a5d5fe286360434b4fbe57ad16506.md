Forty-two people have now been arrested in connection with the protest in Great Eastern Road, Waltham Cross, outside of the Newsprinters printing works. Officers have been working hard throughout the night to ease the disruption and further arrests are anticipated.

Assistant Chief Constable Owen Weatherill said: "We were called to reports of a protest, involving around 100 people, at around 10pm last night (Friday 4 September) and quickly mobilised resources to the scene. This remains a fast-moving operation, involving assistance from neighbouring forces. The inconsiderate actions of a few people have prevented businesses from operating. Protestors ignored our requests to move location, so we have taken robust action to enable the roads to be reopened and to remove the protestors causing obstructions.

"Throughout the night, officers have worked relentlessly to ease disruption and their efforts have ensured that all main roads, including the nearby A10, have remained open throughout the incident. We remain at the scene and are doing all we can to ensure the situation is dealt with as quickly as possible, and we anticipate that further arrests will take place throughout the morning as we continue to clear the obstructions."
