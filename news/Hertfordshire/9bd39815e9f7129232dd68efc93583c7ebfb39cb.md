A 36 year old man from Hitchin who slashed his friend across the face with a Stanley knife has today (Thursday April 19) been sentenced to 12 years in prison at St Albans Crown Court.

Alan Copestake, 36, of Ickleford Road in Hitchin was cleared of attempted murder, but found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and being in possession of a bladed article, when the case went to trial on March 6.

On Monday September 4, 2017, at around 4.30am, police officers were called to Cromdale Walk in Stevenage following a report of two men fighting. Copestake was found at the scene along with a Stanley knife and reports of a 39 year old man being taken to the Lister Hospital with a serious slash wound to his face were received some time later.

Copestake was promptly arrested and it transpired the victim and Copestake were known to one another.

Detective Inspector Chris Treadwell said: "We are very pleased with the sentencing and hope it acts as a deterrent to those who think it is acceptable to carry and use a knife. We are committed to tackling knife crime in Stevenage and will deal robustly with those we catch. The victim in this case received life changing injuries, but it could have been much worse."
