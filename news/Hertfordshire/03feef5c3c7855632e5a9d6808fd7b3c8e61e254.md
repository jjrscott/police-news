Police are trying to trace a man as part of an investigation into two incidents where dogs were reportedly kicked.

The latest incident happened just after 1pm on 3 July in Batchwood Drive, when a dog was kicked in the face by the man, who was jogging. The dog was with a dog walker.

At 10.41am on 21 May, a woman and her daughter were walking their dog outside Morrisons, in Hatfield Road, when the man kicked her dog.

Between 11am and 12 midday from 12 April 12 and 26 April*, the same woman was approached by the same man. On this occasion, he lunged at her in a threatening manner. She did not have her dog with her on this occasion.

PC Dawn Rust said: "We are asking for the public's help in trying to trace this man who was believed to be in the area at the time. Witnesses to both incidents were shocked by the man's unprovoked behaviour. If you know who this man is or have had a similar experience, please get in touch with us on 101 quoting reference 41/59971/19."
