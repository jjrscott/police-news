Over 750 commuters were handed leaflets about the Constabulary's new public feedback system, _echo_ on Wednesday (September 18).

Officers from the St Albans Safer Neighbourhood team were joined by the _echo_ team based at Police Headquarters and Thameslink colleagues from 7.30am to 8am.

St Albans Safer Neighbourhood Inspector Andy Wiseman said: "It was a great opportunity to speak to commuters and let them know about _echo_ as we appreciate all feedback, whether it is good or bad."

They were asked the question "What matters most to you about policing in St Albans?"

The issues highlighted by commuters included speeding, anti-social behaviour, loud cars, drugs, dangerous or inconsiderate parking outside schools and bike thefts.

He said: "A lot of these issues already feature in our local safer neighbourhood priorities but we are always keen to hear about new problems or issues causing concern to residents. We will act on the information received to help make St Albans residents feel - and more importantly, be - safer."
