Two men were arrested for an attempted burglary in Potters Bar thanks to quick-thinking members of the public who called police after they saw two men acting suspiciously.

Kieran Mohan, age 26, of Gordon Road in Finchley and Alexander Prentice, age 25, of no fixed abode, were arrested in Baker Street for an attempted burglary in Elmfield Road in Potters Bar and possession of a controlled substance (several bags of cannabis). They were remanded and appeared at Hatfield Remand Court on Boxing Day.

Detective Sergeant Annie Waylett said: "We are very grateful to the local residents who promptly called us about men acting suspiciously as we were able to make quick arrests. We rely on the public to be our ears and eyes to help us prevent crime."
