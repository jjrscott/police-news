Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a man who is wanted.

Charlie Shillibeer, aged 26, whose last known address is in Sawbridgeworth, is wanted in connection with offences across Hertfordshire.

He failed to appear at St Albans Crown Court yesterday, Monday, June 17 and is also wanted in connection with a dwelling burglary, a Section 4 Public Order Act and a breach of court bail.

He also has connections to Bourne in Lincolnshire and is known to frequent the Peterborough area.

Anyone who sees Charlie or knows of his whereabouts is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/10121/19 or report information online.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form.
