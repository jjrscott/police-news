Sixteen new Special Constables were warmly welcomed into Hertfordshire Constabulary during their Attestation Ceremony at Police Headquarters on Thursday, June 14.

During eleven weeks of training, the new recruits learnt about basic law around theft, public order, assaults, traffic, powers of arrest and Stop and Search. They also used a virtual learning environment which trained them in legislation.

Each graduate went through a rigorous selection process and had to pass a final exam and practical assessments to enable them to qualify for the role of Special Constable.

Those that graduated are:

 * **Marcus Mariconda** , who will be based at a police station in East Herts
 * **Raymond Higginson** , who will be based at a police station in East Herts

 * **Aichatou Monde** , who will be based at a police station in East Herts
 * **Tim Seydali** , who will be based at a police station in East Herts*
 * **Jack Orchard** , who will be based at a police station in East Herts*
 * **Jamie Thomas** , who will be based at Hemel Hempstead Police Station*
 * **Emma Whiteman,** who will be based at Hemel Hempstead Police Station*
 * **Simon Winters** , who will be based at Borehamwood Police Station*
 * **Niamh Burns** , who will be based at Watford Police Station*
 * **Rebecca Bonfield** , who will be based at Hatfield Police Station
 * **Thomas Taylor** , who will be based at Hatfield Police Station
 * **Chris Dickman** , who will be based at Watford Police Station
 * **Jeremy Kaye** , who will be based at Borehamwood Police Station
 * **Samuel Lake,** who will be based at Hemel Hempstead Police Station
 * **Sarah Dewsnapp,** who will be based at Broxbourne Police Station
 * **Jake Sallis** , who will be based at a police station in East Herts

They were joined by their family and friends.

Over the next 12 months, the new recruits will continue their training, allowing them to pass out as substantive Special Constables once they are assessed as fit for independent patrol.

**Assistant Chief Constable Bill Jephson awarded the Specials with their certificates. He said:** "It is a great honour to welcome these new Special Constables to the Constabulary. The work they do is vital in helping us to police the county. I want to wish them all well as they now move on to undertake this important role within the communities of Hertfordshire."

**Special Constabulary Superintendent, Mike Allardyce said:** "It gives me a great sense of pride to welcome these new Special Constables into the team. I have no doubt they will find this a genuinely rewarding volunteering role. Becoming a Special Constable brings with it the promise of being involved in something exciting, worthwhile and making a real difference in the local community as well as having the chance to learn new skills. Each of our new colleagues will make a significant contribution to policing in Hertfordshire."

**Assistant Police and Crime Commissioner for Hertfordshire, Stuart Nagler said:** "We're very fortunate to have such a dedicated team of Special Constables in Hertfordshire and they bring a different and valuable perspective to our policing.

"Our Specials have in the past provided specialist knowledge to some of the most challenging policing situations, including during major cyber-attacks, and we want to build on this by recruiting even more people to the role."

**Recruitment of Special Constables**

Hertfordshire Constabulary is actively recruiting Special Constables. It is looking for motivated team players wanting a challenge. Special Constables have full police powers, uniform and protective equipment and work alongside the regular force.

Special Constables get involved in all areas of frontline policing - from high visibility patrols around pubs and clubs at the weekend and being called to assist at the scene of a road traffic collision or burglary to arresting offenders or reassuring and advising residents after a crime has occurred.

Aside from 'response' or local Safer Neighbourhood policing, there are constantly evolving opportunities to work within specialist policing environments, such as the investigation of modern slavery, human trafficking, child sexual exploitation, cybercrime, domestic abuse and prisoner processing.

Those with an interest or expertise in countryside and rural issues can become Rural Special Constables who are dedicated to the needs of rural communities. They work alongside our Rural Operation Support Team (ROST) and local police Safer Neighbourhood Teams investigating heritage crime or wildlife offences, tackling hare coursing or poaching, to dealing with fly-tipping or the theft of heating oil.

Once initial training is complete, Specials are coached by regular officers to complete their Police Action Checklists and are then deemed fit for independent patrol. On average this can take around 12 months.
