* ### Joint Protective Services Year in Review

 * ### Thousands of arrests made and sentencings secured

 * ### Officers and staff thanked for their hard work

Officers and staff working under the Joint Protective Services Command for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire have secured over 400 years custodial sentences for major crime investigations, made over 2,000 arrests, worked tirelessly around casualty reduction and carried out thousands of hours of training in public order, Counter Terrorism and planning for major and critical incidents.

Other highlights from the last financial year include our dog unit sniffing out significant amounts of drugs and cash and our firearms officers supporting colleagues in the three forces at over 100 pre-planned operations.

In total since tri-force collaboration in 2012, the Major Crime Unit has secured over 3600 years of custodial sentences.

A video showcasing the work of the units in the past financial year (2018/19) can be watched here.

Assistant Chief Constable Paul Fullwood, who is in charge of JPS, said: "The policing world remains a challenging one but I am always so pleased to see the great work from our units on a daily basis."

The units which serve under JPS are: Armed Policing Unit, Camera, Tickets and Collisions, Civil Contingencies Unit, Dog Unit, Operational Support Unit, Major Crime Unit, Road Policing Unit, Scientific Services Unit and JPS Counter Terrorism Protect and Prepare.

ACC Fullwood continued: "The work of our collaborated units has seen thousands of arrests, some of the most violent offenders being jailed for significant periods and tens of thousands of crime scenes being attended.

"At the heart of everything we do are the communities we serve and in particular victims and I would like to say a heartfelt thank you to my staff for everything they do."
