Police have released an image of a woman they would like to speak to in connection with an attempted theft at a supermarket in Welwyn Garden City.

Around 8.30pm on Friday October 26, two women entered Morrison's on Black Fan Road. It is believed they placed bottles of alcohol and meat in their bags before trying to leave the store without paying for the goods. They were confronted by a security guard who managed to retrieve the items.

Police would like to identify the woman pictured as she was nearby and may have information that can assist the investigation.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the police on the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/50257/18, or report information online.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
