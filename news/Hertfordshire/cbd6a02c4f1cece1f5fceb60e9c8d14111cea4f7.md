Officers are releasing images of suspected stolen property in the hopes of reuniting the items with their rightful owners.

The electrical items were recovered following an alleged burglary in Highwood Avenue on May 22, however enquiries to trace their owners have been unsuccessful to date.

PC Ben Swapp, who is investigating, said: "Despite our enquiries, we have been unable to trace the rightful owners of these items so far. I am appealing for anyone who recognises them to please get in touch.

"Not only could we return your property to you, you may also have vital information that could assist us in our ongoing investigation."

Anyone who thinks they may know who the items belong to should call the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/85/18. You can also report information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.

 * A 36-year-old man and a 40-year-old woman, who are both from Bushey, were arrested on suspicion of burglary in connection with this incident. They remain under investigation while enquiries continue.
