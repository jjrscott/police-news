Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a man who is wanted.

James Barber, aged 29 and of no fixed address, is wanted in connection with being recalled to prison.

He has links to Cheshunt and Hackney in London.

Anyone who has seen him or has information about his whereabouts is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101 or online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
