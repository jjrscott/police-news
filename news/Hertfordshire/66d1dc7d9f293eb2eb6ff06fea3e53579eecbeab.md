* ### St Albans Magistrates' Court have granted closure orders on two flats in Chambers Grove

 * ### This followed continuous reports of anti-social behaviour and drug-related activity

 * ### Worried residents are urged to report their concerns to police

The Welwyn Hatfield Community Safety Unit have recently shut down two properties in Welwyn Garden City as they continue to crack down on anti-social behaviour and drug-related activity.

On Wednesday 11 December, St Albans Magistrates' Court granted closure orders on two flats in Chambers Grove following continuous reports of anti-social behaviour and drug-related activity. The closure orders mean that no-one can enter the properties for three months and anyone who breaches this will be arrested.

The court was satisfied that the necessary criteria for a closure order had been met:

 1. That a person has engaged, or is likely to engage, in disorderly, offensive or criminal behaviour on the premises, or
 2. That the use of the premises has resulted, or is likely to result, in serious nuisance to members of the public, or
 3. That there has been, or is likely to be, disorder near those premises associated with the use of those premises

PC John Phelan, from the Welwyn Hatfield Community Safety Unit, said: "If you are allowing drugs to be used or sold at your property, please be warned; we will shut your property down. It is not fair to inflict anti-social behaviour on your neighbours and we will do all we can to support those affected by the misery of such behaviour.

"If you have concerns about a property near you, please don't hesitate to get in touch. You can report information online at herts.police.uk/report, speak to an operator in our Force Communications Room via our online web chat at herts.police.uk/contact or call the non-emergency number 101."

If a crime is in progress or someone's life is in danger, call 999 immediately.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
