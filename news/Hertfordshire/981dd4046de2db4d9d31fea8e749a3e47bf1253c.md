A 47-year-old man has been charged in connection with an alleged assault in the early hours of yesterday morning (Sunday, June 16).

John Murphy, of Maidstone Road, London, has been charged with two counts of assault by beating of an emergency worker.

Murphy was arrested after two female paramedics were reportedly assaulted in the back of an ambulance van in Sun Street. They both sustained bruising.

Murphy was bailed and is next due to appear at Stevenage Magistrates Court on July 27.
