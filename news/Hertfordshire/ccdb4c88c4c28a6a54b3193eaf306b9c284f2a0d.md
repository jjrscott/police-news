We can now confirm that five men who were identified following our initial CCTV appeal regarding a robbery in New Road, Croxley Green, on July 7 have been eliminated from the investigation.

All five assisted us with our enquiries and it was soon established that they were innocent parties and none of them were involved with the incident. We would like to thank them for their help.

Officers have now exhausted all lines of enquiry and as such, the investigation has now been finalised in line with Force policy. The victim has been made aware of this development.

However, if any new information about the incident comes to light then this will be investigated accordingly.

You can submit information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report, via web chat or by calling the non-emergency number 101.
