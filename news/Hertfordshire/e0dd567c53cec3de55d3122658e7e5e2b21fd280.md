Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a woman who is wanted.

Erin Egan, aged 36, whose last known address is Epsom Road, Watford, is wanted for failing to appear at court in connection with fraud by false representation.

It is believed that she is in the Watford area.

Anyone who sees her, or has any information about her whereabouts, is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via 101 or report information online.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form.

For over 30 years, Crimestoppers has always kept its promise of anonymity to everyone who contacts them.
