* Do you live in Bedwell, Pin Green, or the Town Centre area of Stevenage?
 * Are you interested in having a say in what issues your local neighbourhood officers should concentrate on as a priorities?
 * Would you be interested in attending a public meeting to have your views considered?

If the answer to all these questions is 'yes' then your local police team would like to hear from you.

**The Central Safer Neighbourhood Team will be in the coffee shop in the Pin Green Community Centre on Wednesday 13 November, between 7pm and 8.30pm.**

"Following a successful meeting in Bedwell in September, where we met local residents to discuss policing issues in their area, we are now holding a second public meeting to allow the community to be fully involved in the next policing priority setting process," explained Sergeant Chris Adshead.

"We are looking forward to meeting more local residents and getting a clear understanding of all of the issues, as they share their views and experiences about what goes on in their local areas."
