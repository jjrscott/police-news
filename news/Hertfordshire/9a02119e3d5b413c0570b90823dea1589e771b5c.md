Police are appealing for witnesses and information following an incident in Letchworth during which a vehicle was damaged.

Between 1pm and 1.30pm on May 25, it is alleged that a Nissan Juke was driven dangerously in Bedford Road, while travelling in the direction of Icknield Way.

A confrontation then occurred in Cowslip Hill at the junction with Icknield Way, between the driver of the vehicle and another driver who was travelling in an Audi.

Damage was subsequently caused to the Audi and the offender left the scene.

PC Paul Fletcher, who is investigating, said: "I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident, or events leading up to it, to please get in touch. I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and may have captured footage on a dash cam."

Anyone with information is asked to contact PC Fletcher by emailing paul.fletcher2@herts.pnn.police.uk or calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/1784/18. You can also report information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
