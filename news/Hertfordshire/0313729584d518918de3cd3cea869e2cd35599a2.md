Officers have released photos of brooches stolen during a burglary in Brookmans Park n a bid to trace them.

Between midday and 5.30pm on Sunday, April 21, offender(s) gained access to a property in Bradmore Way after damaging a window.

Along with two brooches (pictured) and a tablet, the offender(s) took numerous jewellery items:

 * Three gold bangles
 * A gold brooch
 * A gold eternity ring
 * A gold ring
 * Two pairs of gold earrings
 * A gold chain bracelet
 * A gold chain necklace

Detective Constable Jonathan Channell from the Welwyn Hatfield Local Crime Unit, said: "The brooches were specially made for the victim so understandably they are of great sentimental value.

"They are very distinctive so if you think you have seen them or been offered them for sale please get in touch. Likewise, if you believe you have been offered any of the other stolen property for sale, please contact us.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who might have witnessed the burglary or has information about what happened. If you can help, please email me at _jonathan.channell@herts.pnn.police.uk_ or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/36119/19."
