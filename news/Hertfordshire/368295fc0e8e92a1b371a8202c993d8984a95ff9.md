Officers executed a warrant in Hemel Hempstead this morning (Friday, April 26) where an imitation firearm was recovered.

The flat in Fletcher Way, Highfield, was entered by officers under Section 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 just before 7am.

PC Swann from the Operation Scorpion team said: "During the search an imitation firearm was discovered and seized by officers. Our enquiries are currently on-going to establish who the weapon belongs to. A quantity of suspected cannabis was also found inside the address.

"This morning's warrant was executed due to information received from members of the public. We depend on local communities to be our eyes and ears and I would urge anyone who has information about criminal activity in their neighbourhood to report it so that we can take appropriate action.

"We can only tackle criminals and the damage they cause to local communities with the support of the public."
