A Watford man has been jailed after pleading guilty to three burglaries in the town.

Neil Williams, aged 49, from Queens Road, was sentenced to three years and four months at St Albans Crown Court on Monday (October 29).

On May 31 this year, Williams broke into a property in Cassiobury Park Avenue but was disturbed by the occupant and fled empty handed. His finger prints were found at the scene.

Two weeks later, he smashed the front door of a property in Mildred Avenue to gain entry and stole a bag of suits and some tools.

On July 10, he stole a laptop, cash and a watch after climbing through an open window of a ground floor flat in Rickmansworth Road.

Following investigations by the Watford Local Crime Unit, Williams was arrested on July 28.

He was subsequently charged with two counts of burglary and asked for the third offence to be taken into consideration.
