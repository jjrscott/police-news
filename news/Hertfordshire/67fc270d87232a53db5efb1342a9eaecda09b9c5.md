Officers investigating a burglary in Watford have released an image of a man they would like to speak to as part of their enquiries.

It happened in Woodmere Avenue between 4.30pm and 4.40pm on Monday, March 12.

Offender(s) have attempted to jemmy the rear patio door but failed before smashing the kitchen window with a brick and entering the property.

They searched the property and took a television, a quantity of cash and a Black and Decker drill before leaving the property in the direction of Douglas Avenue.

PC Jon Holmes, who is investigating, said: "A neighbour shouted at the offenders as they made their escape and this may have caught attention of members of the public in the area.

"A gentleman who was passing by as this happened may have seen the offenders getting into a vehicle, therefore I am very keen to speak with him and any other witnesses who were in the area at the time."
