* ### Cat injured and receiving treatment after being shot

 * ### Officers investigating are appealing for witnesses

Police in East Herts are appealing for information and witnesses after a cat was shot with a pellet gun in Levens Green.

It is believed the cat was shot between 6.15pm and 10.15pm on Saturday, October 14.

The injured pet was able to make it home. It was immediately taken to the vets where an X-ray showed that it had been shot in the front right shoulder, probably while it was in the sitting position. The cat was operated on and it currently still at the veterinary hospital.

Sergeant Duncan Wallace from the Rural Safer Neighbourhood Team said: "News of this incident will understandably leave other cat owners in the area concerned about the safety of their own pets.

"This is the second incident in this area and I am appealing for anyone who believes they may know who is responsible for this shooting, or anyone who has information that could help the investigation, to get in touch."

Anyone who has any information is asked to contact the Hertfordshire Constabulary non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference A6/17/646 or report information online at www.contacthertspolice.uk/Report/Crime.

If you would prefer to provide information anonymously please call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or submit details through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
