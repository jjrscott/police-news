Officers investigating the theft of two garden statues in Gaddesden Row have released images of both items in the hope the public can help reunite them with their owners.

It happened at a property on Gaddesden Lane between 11pm and midnight on Tuesday, May 21.

Offender(s) approached the property and stole both bronze stag and deer statues.

PC Brian Evans, who is investigating, said: "The statues weigh around 20kg each and are between 3ft and 4ft high.

"They of sentimental value to the owner as they have had them for many years, and I want to reassure them that we are doing everything we can to trace them.

"I would like to appeal to the public and ask them if they have seen any statues matching the description for sale locally, on social media."
