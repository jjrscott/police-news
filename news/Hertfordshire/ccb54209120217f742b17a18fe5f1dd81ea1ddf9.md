Police are appealing for information and witnesses following three incidents of religiously aggravated criminal damage overnight in Shenley.

Officers were called just before 9.20am today (Monday, January 7) to reports of offensive graffiti on a fence in Porters Park Drive.

As part of their enquiries they became aware of two further incidents of graffiti - on a fence at Shenley Chapel in Porters Park Drive and also onto a wall of the chapel itself.

PC Sophie Stalley, from the Potters Bar and Shenley Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "We have received numerous phone calls and emails from people reporting this graffiti and understand that it has caused concern among the local community.

"After officers attended this morning they quickly arranged for the graffiti to be removed and this is being carried out as soon as possible to prevent any further upset.

"All of these incidents are being linked and enquiries are currently on-going.

"Anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area or has information that may assist the investigation is asked to contact police by calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting ISR 137 of January 7 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

"If you'd prefer to stay anonymous you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or submit details via their untraceable online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org."
