Officers investigating two incidents of theft in Bushey are releasing a picture of a man they would like to speak to as part of their enquiries.

Between 9.38pm and 9.40pm on Monday, October 15, an offender entered a McDonald's restaurant in Tylers Way, North Western Avenue. The offender walked over to the till area and removed a cake cabinet that was on the counter, and then left the restaurant with the cabinet and its contents.

A second theft occurred at the McDonald's restaurant between 10.53pm and 10.56pm on Tuesday, October 23. A cake cabinet was stolen and officers are linking the two incidents.

Officers would like to speak to the man pictured as he may have information about the thefts that could prove useful to the investigation.

Anyone who recognises him or has any other information that could assist the investigation, is asked to contact PC Sarah Campbell by emailing, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/46668/18 and 41/51178/18 or report information online.

Alternatively, contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court.
