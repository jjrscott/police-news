Officers investigating an assault in Waltham Cross are appealing for information and witnesses.

It happened between 6pm and 7pm on Wednesday, December 26 outside the Lee Valley White Water Centre on Eleanor Cross Road.

The victim, a man in his 40s, was walking towards Waltham Abbey when two men approached him.

They asked him for a cigarette, which he gave to them, after which they attacked him and hit him in the head.

The victim fell to the floor and sustained severe swelling to the face as well as a suspected bleed to the brain.

The offenders are described as white, around 20 to 25 years old and wearing dark clothing. One offender had a hood up, the other was wearing what looked like a ski hat.

DC Richard Webster said: "Did anyone see this assault, which happened on Boxing Day evening?

"Did you see two men running or see the victim walk away from the scene? The victim would have been noticeable because of his injuries."

If you have any information that could help, please call the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/69584/18 or report information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report.
