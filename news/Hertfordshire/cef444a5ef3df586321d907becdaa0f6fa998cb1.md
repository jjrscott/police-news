* ### Witnesses are being sought to an affray on Blindman's Lane, Waltham Cross.

We are appealing for witnesses, information and any CCTV or dashcam footage following an affray in Waltham Cross.

At around 12.30pm on Wednesday 11 November a man reportedly became involved in a confrontation on Blindman's Lane with another man and a woman, which resulted in him suffering a back injury. His injuries are not life changing or life threatening.

Detective Constable Chris Jones, of the Broxbourne Local Crime Unit, said: "I'm keen to hear from anyone who witnessed this incident, who has not already come forward.

"It took place near a nursery and parents may have been in the area and seen something during the lunchtime drop-off and pick up time.

"Additionally, if you live nearby and have CCTV footage or if you were driving passed and have any relevant dash cam footage I'd like you to make contact.

"If you are able to help I can be contacted directly via email at christopher.jones2@herts.pnn.police.uk"
