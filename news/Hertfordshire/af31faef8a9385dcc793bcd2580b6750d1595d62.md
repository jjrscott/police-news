Officers are appealing for the public's help to trace a man who is missing from Stevenage.

Twenty-three year old Jack Baynes-Birchenhall was last seen in the Poplars area of the town at around 4am this morning (Tuesday, March 5).

It is believed that Jack may have boarded a train.

Jack is described as white, of medium build, with short brown hair and a short beard. He was last seen wearing a green jumper, dark coloured jeans, green trainers and a blue coat with a hood.

Officers are growing increasingly concerned for Jack's welfare. If you have seen him since he went missing or have information on his whereabouts, please call the non-emergency number 101 quoting ISR 76 of March 5. For immediate sightings, call 999 straight away.
