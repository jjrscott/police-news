A 25 year old man has been arrested and charged following two incidents of burglary in Potters Bar.

Alexandru Dranga, of Fisher Road in Harrow, was arrested on Thursday, January 10 following burglaries at two properties in Potters Bar.

The first break in occurred between 4.30pm on January 2 and 1.30pm on January 6 at a property in Oakroyd Avenue.

Access was gained through a rear window which was jemmied open, before an extensive search was carried out.

The victim believes nothing was stolen.

The second incident occurred on January 6 between 3.20am and 4am, when a property in Baker Street was broken into.

A panel was removed on the back door to gain entry and a search was conducted.

Dranga appeared at Hatfield Magistrates' Court on Saturday (January 12) where he was bailed and is next due to appear at St Albans Crown Court on February 11 for trial.

A further man has been released under investigation for both offences.
