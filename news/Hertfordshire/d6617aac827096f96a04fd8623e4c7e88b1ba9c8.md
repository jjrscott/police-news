Officers are appealing for the public's help to trace a woman who is missing from Stevenage.

41 year old Martine Blair was last seen at 1.10pm today (Wednesday 4 December) walking through an underpass next to the Lister Hospital in Coreys Mill Lane.

Martine is described as white, with short dark brown hair. She was last seen wearing a brown fluffy jacket, leopard print leggings and black trainers. Martine sometimes wears a wig (as pictured).

Officers are growing increasingly concerned for Martine's welfare.

Martine has links to Devon.

If you have seen Martine since she went missing or have information on her whereabouts please call the non-emergency number 101 quoting ISR 315 of 4 December. For immediate sightings, call 999 straight away.
