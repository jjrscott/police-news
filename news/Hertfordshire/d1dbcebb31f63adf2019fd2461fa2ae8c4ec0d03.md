A "dangerous" man was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for GBH with intent and his use of coercive and controlling behaviour towards his former partner at St Albans Crown Court yesterday (Wednesday May 1).

Demetrio Vaccianna, 30, of Hitchin Road in Luton, was found guilty of GBH, coercive control, and making threats with a bladed article following a trial. He pleaded guilty to causing actual bodily harm (ABH).

On September 9, 2018 in Hemel Hempstead he subjected his former partner to a serious assault which included smacking her head against a wall, striking her in the face and threatening to kill her. This left the victim with cuts, bruises and a broken hand. He also threatened two men with a knife in public during this incident who tried to intervene. On another occasion Vaccianna made threats to kill his partner and strangled her, causing her to pass out. Throughout their relationship Vaccianna he had used coercive and controlling behaviour towards the victim subjecting her to both physical and psychological abuse.

Vaccianna was sentenced to eight years imprisonment for GBH - extended by three years because he was deemed by Judge Stephen Warner to be a dangerous offender. He was also sentenced to 24 months for being threatening with a bladed article and two-and-a-half years for coercive control. He pleaded guilty to an assault occasioning ABH and received a 16 month prison sentence, all to be served concurrently.

Detective Constable James Harrington from the Domestic Abuse Investigation and Safeguarding Unit (DAISU) said: "Vaccianna made the victim's life a living nightmare questioning her every move and restricting her movements as well as violently assaulting her. No-one has to put up with this kind of abuse and she has been very brave in speaking to our specially trained police officers, who have been able to support her and make sure he is no longer a threat to other women.

"As well as the prison sentence, Vaccianna has also been given a lifelong restraining order which prevents him from contacting the victim and two other men."

He said: "Domestic abuse isn't just about violence. The coercive control law recognises the impact that threats, intimidation or verbal abuse over a sustained period can also have on victims. It can leave them feeling isolated, drained of confidence and dependent on their abuser.

"I hope this sentence goes some way in helping the victim to recover from the horrendous ordeal of abuse that Vaccianna subjected her to and will encourage anyone else living in an abusive relationship to speak to the police or another agency and to seek help."

Judge Warner said Vaccianna had shown limited, if any remorse, and had forced his victim and two others to re-live their experience by going to trial.
