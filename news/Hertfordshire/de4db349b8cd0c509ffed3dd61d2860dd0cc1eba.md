Two men have been arrested in connection with the theft of catalytic converters in Borehamwood.

Police received a call at around 12.20pm on Saturday (28 November) to report the theft of a catalytic converter from a car in The Boulevard Retail Park. A search of the area was conducted and two men were arrested on suspicion of theft and going equipped to steal.

Those arrested are:

 * A 33-year-old man from Hackney, London
 * A 29-year-old from London

They have since been released on police bail while the investigation continues.

Detective Constable Barnaby Godding from the Hertsmere Local Crime Unit said: "I'd like to thank the members of the public who contacted police to notify us of suspicious activity and I would continue to urge anyone who sees suspicious activity around vehicles to contact us, particularly where people are trying to get under cars in public car parks or on public roads. If you see this happening, please call 999 immediately."

**In order to minimise the chance of becoming a victim we offer the following advice:**

 * Lock your car whenever it is left unattended and keep it in a garage when parked at night if possible.
 * When using a garage is not possible, park close to fences, walls or a kerb with the exhaust being closest to the fence, wall or kerb to make theft difficult.
 * Consider fitting CCTV on your home or driveway, to help deter thieves.
 * Use PIR or LED security lighting to make your vehicle more visible and this can also act as a deterrent.
 * If your catalytic converter is bolted on, consider having the bolts welded to make removal difficult.
 * Fit protective coverings on catalytic converters, such as the Toyota manufactured CATLOC device, (these are made for Toyota Prius made between 2004 and 2009) as these can make it much more difficult for thieves.
 * Have your catalytic converter etched or forensically marked, and put stickers in the windscreen to say this has been done.
 * Look for car parks with a Secured Car Park sign which have recognised levels of security. If you have a garage at home, ensure you use it and lock it properly.
 * Noisy gravel on your drive can help deter a would-be thief, as they don't want to alert you to their approach.
 * Never leave valuable items or tools on display in your vehicle as this may encourage a thief to break in.
