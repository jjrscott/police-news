Officers investigating an incident of theft in Royston are releasing pictures of a person they would like to speak to as part of their enquiries.

At 4.07pm on Saturday, November 10, a man entered Tesco Express in Market Hill. He asked a female staff member for cigarettes and when she turned around the offender concealed a Poppy appeal charity box in his coat and left the store.

Police would like to speak to the man pictured as he may have information about the theft that could prove useful to the investigation.

Anyone who recognises him or has any other information that could assist the investigation, is asked to contact PCSO Ashley Armstrong by emailing, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/54895/18 or report information online.

Alternatively, contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court.
