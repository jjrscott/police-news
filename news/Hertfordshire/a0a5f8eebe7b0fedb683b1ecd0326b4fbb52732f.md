Officers have released a photo of a 12-year-old boy's bike which was stolen in Harpenden and are appealing for anyone with information to get in contact.

At around 6.35pm on Saturday, April 6, the distinctive bike, which has gold-coloured handlebars, was taken from outside the cemetery on Westfield Road and believed to have been ridden down Hyde View Road.

PCSO Joshua Walton, who is investigating, said: "The bike is a black and white Specialized Enduro mountain bike. I'd like to hear from anyone who thinks they have seen it or been offered it for sale.

"I would also encourage anyone who has any other information about the theft to get in touch.

"If you can help, please call the non-emergency number 101 or email me at _joshua.walton@herts.pnn.police.uk_ _,_ quoting crime reference 41/31482/19."

Below are a number of steps you can take to help prevent your bike from being stolen:

 * Mark the frame of your bike with your postcode using a UV pen or contact your local cycle shop, as most will mark them for a small cost. You can contact us for advice on other property marking initiatives available.
 * Register your bike on www.immobilise.com, a free online property database which police use to check stolen property. That way, if your bike does get stolen, you have more chance of it being returned to you.
 * Never leave your bike unlocked - even if you're just popping into the newsagents.
 * The best kind of lock is a quality solid steel D-shaped shackle lock. You can buy these at any bike shop.
 * Always lock your bike to something solid like a lamp-post or railings, preferably in a public area.
 * If you have quick release wheels, take off the front wheel and lock it to the frame and back wheel.
 * If you have a pump or detachable lights take them with you when you leave your bike.
 * Make sure you have adequate insurance cover for your bike.
