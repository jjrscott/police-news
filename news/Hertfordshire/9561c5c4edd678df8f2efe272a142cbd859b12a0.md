Officers have released a picture of a painting that was stolen from Watford in a bid to trace it.

The painting, which is of two horses called Zebedee and Beau, was stolen from St Mary's Church in Church Street between 9am and 10am on Thursday 14 November.

PC Julian Lane, who is investigating, said: "The artist who painted the picture is understandably devastated as a lot of time and effort went into creating it.

"Have you seen the painting? Do you think you have been offered it for sale?

"The painting is distinctive and features the artist's signature so I am hopeful that we can find it and return it to the church.

"If you can help, please get in touch by calling 101 or emailing quoting crime reference 41/105259/19."
