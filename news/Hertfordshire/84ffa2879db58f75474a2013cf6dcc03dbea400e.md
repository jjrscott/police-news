Police are releasing an image of a man they would like to speak to as part of their enquiries following an incident of sexual assault in Watford.

At around 3.30pm on October 11, 2018, a teenage girl entered Watford Hair and Beauty on Market Street to purchase some products and was approached by a man in the store who said "you're so beautiful".

The girl tried to walk away from the man who then followed her and grabbed her by the arms, before attempting to kiss her.

While she was at the till paying for the products, the man inappropriately touched her, after which the girl quickly left.

PC Ryan Doyle said: "We have conducted significant enquiries since this incident occurred, and now appealing to anyone who recognises him to please get in contact as he may have information about what happened to assist the investigation.

"If you recognise him, or have any information that could assist the investigation please email me on _ryan.doyle@herts.pnn.police.uk_ or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/45877/18."
