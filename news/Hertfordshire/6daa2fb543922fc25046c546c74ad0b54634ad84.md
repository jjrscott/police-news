Officers investigating a theft in Borehamwood are releasing an image of a man they would like to identify, as they believe he may be able to help with their enquiries.

On Thursday 17 October, at around 6pm, several items of clothing were stolen from Eco Associates Worldwide in Shenley Road.

PCSO Natalie Lancaster, from the Borehamwood Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "We're hoping that someone may be able to identify the man pictured, as we believe that he was in the shop at the time and may have information which could assist us with our investigation.

"If you recognise him, or have any information, please contact us."

It is believed this incident may also be linked to two further reports of theft in the area. On Monday 18 November, at around 8.50pm, several bottles of alcohol were stolen from the BP petrol station on Elstree Way. On Saturday 23 November, at around 5am, a television worth over Â£300 was stolen from the Shenley Road branch of Tesco.
