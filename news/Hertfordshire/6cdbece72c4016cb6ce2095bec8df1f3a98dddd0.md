Officers are appealing for information, witnesses and dash cam footage following a serious collision on the A414/Hertford Road today (Monday 20 April).

Police were called at 12.16pm to reports of a collision involving a red Ford Fiesta and a cyclist.

The collision happened close to the junction with Hatfield House.

Officers remain at the scene alongside the ambulance service.

The cyclist, a man, has sustained serious injuries. A 23 year old woman has been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.

The road has been closed and motorists are advised to avoid the area and seek an alternative route.

Sergeant Sam Cordingley, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit, said: "We are working to establish the circumstances of the collision and I am appealing for anyone who saw what happened, or anyone who has information about the incident, to get in touch.

"Did you see the collision? Did you see the events leading up to it?

"If there's a chance you might have caught the vehicle, the cyclist or the incident on dash cam please check it and let us know.

"Any information you have, no matter how small it might seem, could be vital to the investigation. If you can help, please email my colleague PC Carl Callan at _carl.callan@herts.pnn.police.uk_ quoting ISR 214 of 20 April."
