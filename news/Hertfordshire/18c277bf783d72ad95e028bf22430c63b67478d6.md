Officers are investigating an assault (ABH) in Hitchin and are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information to get in contact.

Sometime between 2pm and 3pm on Saturday, April 6, two men were involved in a verbal altercation in the Sainsbury's Supermarket on Whinbush Road before one man pushed the other, causing him to fall into the fruit display. The man was then reportedly struck with a shopping basket, before walking out of the store.

The man sustained a minor injury.

PC Claire Ross, from the Hitchin Intervention Team, said: "I would like to reassure the public that the two men involved are believed to be known to each other and this was an isolated incident.

"It's believed the supermarket was busy at the time and several members of the public witnessed this incident. I ask anyone who was in the store at the time and saw what happened to get in contact."

Any witnesses or anyone with information should contact PC Ross on claire.ross@herts.pnn.police.uk or the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/31409/19. You can also report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
