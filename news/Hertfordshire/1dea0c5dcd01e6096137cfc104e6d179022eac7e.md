Police are appealing for information and witnesses following a robbery in Hitchin.

At 2.04am on Monday, December 24, the victim - a 40 year old man - pulled over in his black Kia on Cambridge Road between the Railway Bridge and North Herts College.

Two men robbed him of his mobile phone before running off when it's believed they saw a police car pull onto the road.

One of the suspects is known to the victim.

Detective Constable Simon Goodship from the Hitchin Local Crime Unit said: "We'd like to speak to a group of men who were wearing Christmas jumpers and were in the area, as they may have witnessed the crime and could have key information that will help our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact DC Goodship via the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/68872/18 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.

For over 30 years, Crimestoppers has always kept its promise of anonymity to everyone who contacts them.
