Police are appealing for information following having been called at just before 3am today (31 August) to Gammons Lane at the junction on Leavesden Road in Watford to reports of a three vehicle collision and subsequent fight taking place.

Officers attended and found a man in his 20s with alleged stab wounds. He has been taken to hospital.

A further call was received to reports a man had been found with a serious alleged stab wound to his arm in St Georges Road. This man has also been taken to hospital.
