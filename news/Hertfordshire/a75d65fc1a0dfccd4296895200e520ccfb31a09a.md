Officers have released a photo of a valuable chair that was stolen in Hatfield in a bid to trace it.

The chair, which is upholstered and emblazoned with the Union Jack, was stolen from Blackbrook Interior as they prepared to host an exhibition stall at the Game Fair in Hatfield Park.

The stall was set up at 5.30pm on Thursday 25 July and was stolen between this time and 8am the next morning (Friday 26 July).

Sergeant James Stopford, from the Welwyn Hatfield Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "The chair is very distinctive so there is a good chance that someone will have seen it.

"I'd like to hear from anyone who thinks they have seen it or perhaps been offered it for sale.

"Similarly, I am keen to hear from anyone who might have seen the theft take place or anyone who might have information about what happened.

"If you can help, please call the non-emergency number 101 or email me at _james.stopford2@herts.pnn.police.uk_ quoting crime reference 41/67925/19."
