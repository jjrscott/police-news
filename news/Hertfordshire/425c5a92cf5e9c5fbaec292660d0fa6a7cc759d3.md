 * Residents are urged to follow some simple crime prevention advice to make their homes less attractive to thieves. To give your home the lived in look even when you're out use timer switches on a lamp, radio or TV so that they turn on as it gets dark in the afternoons. You should also keep house and car keys out of sight and in a safe place. If you witness any suspicious activity, please report it to police and always dial 999 if a crime is in progress. Further crime prevention advice is available on Hertfordshire Constabulary's website - www.herts.police.uk.
