* ### Boy assaulted in Bishop's Stortford

 * ### Police appeal for witnesses

 * ### Offender's descriptions released

Detectives are appealing for information and witnesses to an assault (GBH) in Bishop's Stortford.

The incident occurred between 6.55pm and 7.25pm on Friday, December 15 outside Tesco Express in South Street.

The victim, a 15 year old boy was involved in an altercation with six males when he was assaulted by several members of the group. He walked away, but was followed by two of the group along South Street and into North Street, ending up in Northgate End where he was assaulted again.

The offenders were all described as white:

 * wearing a green jacket and approximately 5ft 8ins tall
 * wearing a black jacket, approximately 6ft tall with dark hair
 * wearing a 'beany' style hat and approximately 5ft 8ins tall

The males who assaulted him in Northgate End are also white and described as:

 * wearing a black 'puffy' coat and approximately 6ft tall
 * wearing a white coat with the hood up

A white man wearing a red jacket attempted to break up the fight.

Detective Constable Karen Parrott from the Local Crime Unit said: "The boy received serious injuries to his face and had a broken hand as a result of this incident and was obviously distressed about what happened. I'd urge anyone who may have seen the incident take place to make contact as soon as possible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact DC Parrott via email Karen.parrott@herts.pnn.police.uk or through calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference A2/17/2458. You can also report information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
