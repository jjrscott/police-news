Officers investigating an attempted burglary in Bushey are appealing for information and witnesses.

It happened in Magnaville Road just after 7.30pm on Thursday, October 18.

Two offenders attempted to gain access to a property by jemmying the front door with an unknown implement.

They were disturbed by the property's occupants, who heard a noise and went to investigate by opening the door.

Both offenders are described as tall and slim, and they were dressed in black and wore balaclavas.

They ran down the driveway to a waiting vehicle - described as a dark-coloured two-door BMW, possibly a 1 or 2 series - which was driven by another man.

Detective Constable Ian Waldock, from the Hertsmere Local Crime Unit, said: "I am keen to hear from anyone who lives in the area and may have seen any suspicious activity on the evening of the offence.

"Did you see a vehicle matching the description being driven off at speed, particularly around the Heathbourne Road area?

"Any witnesses or anyone with information can contact me on _ian.waldock@herts.pnn.police.uk_ or the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/47684/18. You can also report information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report _"_

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
