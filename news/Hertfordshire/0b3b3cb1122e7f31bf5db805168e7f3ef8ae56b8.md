Police have recovered the vehicle involved in a collision outside Tesco in Rickmansworth on Sunday, December 23.

Just before 2pm, police were called to a report of a car being in collision with several people in the supermarket's car park.

The ambulance service also attended the incident and a woman was taken to Watford General Hospital after sustaining a serious injury. She is now out of hospital, recovering.

Another person, a man, sustained slight injuries and also received hospital treatment.

The vehicle - a blue Citroen C3 - has been recovered in Watford.

It is believed that the driver and passenger were involved in an incident inside the store moments before the collision, where a person was challenged by the store's security after attempting to steal alcohol.

Officers are continuing to work to locate the vehicle's occupants.
