Residents and shoppers in Letchworth were able to pick up free crime prevention goodies and advice at the first of a series of crime prevention roadshows to be held around the county.

The Letchworth Safer Neighbourhood Team joined Crime Prevention Officers in Garden Square on Wednesday 6 November, where they were giving away free timer switches, purse bells and straps, as well as tips on how to keep homes and valuables safe this winter.

Crime Prevention Officer Darren Cowell said: "We are keen to get people thinking about home security and crime prevention this autumn, as we approach Christmas burglaries and other crime can increase. Taking some very simple steps to make your home more secure can make a big difference. Something as basic as leaving a light on can deter a burglar and timer switches are a great way to make your home look occupied. "

He said: "This the first of a series of crime prevention events we will be running around the county, so keep an eye on our Facebook and Twitter accounts to find out when we will be in your area."
