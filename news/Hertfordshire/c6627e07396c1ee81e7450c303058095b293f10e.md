Police in Stevenage are appealing for the public's help to trace a woman they would like to speak to in connection with a fraud offence.

On February 18, two mobile phone contracts were taken out fraudulently at stores in the town. The purchase of a mobile phone was attempted and credit cards and direct debits had also been set up in the victim's name.

Officers would like to speak to the woman pictured as they believe she could have information which could help their investigation.

If you recognise the woman in the pictures or have any information which could help the team please contact PC Kirsty Lambert via the non-emergency number 101 quoting crime reference 41/16829/19 or online.

Alternatively, you can stay anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form.
