Police are appealing for the public's help to identify a man they would like to speak to for help with their enquiries, following a theft in Bishop's Stortford.

The incident took place at around 4.25pm on Friday 3 January at a Boots store in Potter Street.

The offender was seen in the fragrance department bent down putting several gift sets into a large bag with the security tags still attached.

PCSO Natasha Coppin, from the East Herts Local Policing Command, said: "We would like to speak to the person pictured as he may have information which could assist the investigation."

Anyone who recognises this person is asked to email.

You can also report information online, speak to an operator in our Force Communications Room via our online web chat or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/2044/20.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form.
