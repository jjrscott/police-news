* ### Police marking pedal bikes in Hatfield town centre

 * ### Officers giving out crime prevention advice

Take your family's bicycles to Hatfield town centre on Saturday April 13 and police will mark them up so they're less attractive to thieves.

Officers from Hatfield's Safer Neighbourhood Team will be in Market Place, Town Centre, from 12noon to 3pm, marking pedal bikes and giving crime prevention advice.

They can explain how to register bikes on Immobilise and how to sign up to Online Watch Link (OWL), which is part of our Neighbourhood Watch scheme and keeps local people up to date with recent crimes as well as offering advice on how to reduce your chances of becoming a victim of crime.

PCSO Sarah Kinney, from Hatfield's Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "This is a great opportunity to meet with local residents, share some crime prevention advice and mark up bicycles so that they're less attractive to thieves. Please remember not to cycle on pavements or in pedestrian zones."
