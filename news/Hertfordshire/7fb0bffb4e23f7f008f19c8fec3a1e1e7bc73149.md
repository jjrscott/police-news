Police are appealing for witnesses to an incident in the car park of Sainsbury's in Magpie Crescent, Stevenage this morning (Wednesday, January 24).

Police were called to reports of a collision in the car park which occurred at around 10.20am. A woman aged 90 was taken unwell and was taken to hospital where sadly, she later passed away.

PC Jacqueline Lister said: "Our thoughts are with the lady's family at the very difficult time. At this time we are looking to establish the circumstances of the incident and so I would appeal to anyone who was in the car park at the time and saw what happened to make contact with police. You may have dash cam footage which could assist the investigation."

Please call Hertfordshire Constabulary via 101 quoting ISR 220 of 24 January.
