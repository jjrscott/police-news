A man was jailed at St Albans Crown Court yesterday (Tuesday 9 February) in connection with a shooting which occurred in Smallford, near St Albans, last year.

Michael Clark, aged 22, from Ver Meadows in Redbourn, was sentenced to a total of 17 years after pleading guilty to GBH with intent at an earlier hearing on 6 November 2020.

Police received a call shortly after 3pm on 24 March (2020), reporting that a man aged in his 30s had been shot at through a car window in Springfield Road. The vehicle, a silver Mercedes, then fled the scene.

The victim sustained a wound to his side and was airlifted hospital for emergency surgery.

An investigation was subsequently launched by the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit (BCH MCU). Their enquiries identified Clark as the suspect and he was arrested on 13 May.

Detective Inspector Justine Jenkins, from the BCH MCU, said: "We understand incidents such as this will cause concern among the local community, however we quickly identified this as a targeted attack, between people known to each other; although the motive remains unknown.

"Thankfully the victim survived, but he is still suffering from the effects of his injury today.

"I'm pleased that a dangerous man is now off our streets." **
