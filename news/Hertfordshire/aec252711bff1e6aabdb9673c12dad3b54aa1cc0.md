Officers from the Stevenage Safer Neighbourhood Teams have been busy carrying out prevention and detection work around knife crime, in support of the Operation Sceptre national week of action, which took place from Monday 13 July to Sunday 19 July.

On Tuesday 14 July, knife sweeps were carried out in the Hyde shopping area, Hydean Way, Valley Way, Bedwell Park and Bedwell shops. Whilst in the park officers spoke to some young people about the dangers and consequences of knife crime. King Georges Way, Sish lane and the top of King Georges Park were also searched. No knives were located during these searches.

On Thursday 16 July, targeted covert and high visibility patrols were carried out across the town and on Friday 17 July, officers teamed up with colleagues from British Transport Police to carry out covert operations around the railway station. One person was arrested for carrying a knife and for being in possession of a quantity of cannabis.

Safer Neighbourhood Inspector Pat McPeake said: "Knife crime remains a policing priority for Stevenage and my teams work hard to tackle this persistent problem and to raise awareness of the dangers and consequences of carrying knives among our residents, particular the younger members of society."
