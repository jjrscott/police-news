Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a man who has gone missing from Watford.

John Ryan, aged 58, was last seen in the town centre on Monday, October 16.

He is described as white, around 5ft 7ins tall, of medium build and with dark hair.

He was last seen wearing a black leather jacket and blue jeans.

Officers are growing increasingly concerned for John's welfare.

Anyone who has seen John or who knows where he is should call Hertfordshire Constabulary's non-emergency number 101, quoting ISR 242 of October 16.
