Officers are appealing for the public's help to trace a 40-year-old man who is wanted.

Graham East, from Hearne Court, is wanted for breaching a court order related to an assault.

Anyone who sees him or knows of his whereabouts is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference J2/18/450 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/report. Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
