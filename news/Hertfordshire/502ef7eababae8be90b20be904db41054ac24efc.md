* ### Burglars take advantage of unlit homes to carry out their offending as the night's draw in - make sure your home is not one of them.

 * ### St Albans has a tough stance on burglary and has robust plans in place.

 * ### You can help by making sure you lock your windows and doors, use timer switches on lights, consider investing in alarms, CCTV or doorbell cams, and report any suspicious behaviour.

It's a sad fact, but as the nights draw in, burglars take advantage of unlit homes to carry out their offending. The St Albans district has a tough stance on tackling burglars.

St Albans Detective Inspector Alex(andra) Warwick said: "There has been 29.1 per cent fewer burglaries in the first six months of 2019 in the St Albans district compared to the same six months of last year, which is good news. However data gathered over the past three years from January 2016 shows that 39.4 per cent of all burglary offences occur between October and January."

She explained: "We take every burglary personally and put a lot of resources in to preventing and detecting every burglary that happens in St Albans, Harpenden and surrounding districts. We have robust plans in place to prevent burglaries and we know who some of our burglars are, so we keep an extra eye on them. Obviously we cannot be on every street 24 hours a day so I'd like to remind residents to make sure they **lock their windows and doors, use timer switches on lights, consider investing in alarms, CCTV or doorbell cams, and report any suspicious behaviour**."

In August, 2019, Azariah Morgan, age 36, of St Loyes Street, Bedford, was sentenced to five years and four months imprisonment for a number of burglaries committed in St Albans and other parts of Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire between February and April 2019.

If you are burgled, what exactly can burglary victims expect from the police?

When someone dials 999 to report a burglary, with intruders still at the address, all available police units will attend. Some officers will go to the address whilst back up officers will do an area search in the nearby streets and if appropriate, will call on the assistance of the tri-force police helicopter and dog units to help track down the burglars.

When a burglary is discovered retrospectively, officers will attend and take a crime report from the victim and conduct an initial investigation, including statements, initial house-to-house enquiries, crime scene preservation and they will offer victim support. Scenes of crime officers may attend to obtain forensic evidence. The Local Crime Unit will take on the investigation to preserve evidence, see if there are any similarities to other burglaries and identify potential offenders. They will also gather CCTV and review information (intelligence).

Officers will also look at the type of burglary, for example if they specifically targeted an address for high value gold or expensive vehicles, whether it is a daytime or night-time burglary, any series or 'hotpots', how they got into the address (the MO modus operandi) whether it was via the front or back of the property and whether they conducted a tidy or untidy search.

Officers will also be supported by other departments across the Force and work closely with other Community Safety Partnerships (CSPs) and neighbouring forces as well as our Special Constables (volunteers with full police powers). Some of the work is overt but a lot of it is covert, including the use of analysts to look back historically to predict where the hotspots may be, to help allocate police resources.

The best thing we can do is prevent burglaries happening in the first place. **Securely lock all windows and doors, including double locking PVCu doors and give your home a 'lived-in' look**. Make sure you don't make it easy for an opportunist burglar to steal your possessions.

DI Warwick added: "Please report a burglary online or call 101. Please do not report crime on social media. We need to be made aware straight away so we have the best chance of catching the offenders and preventing further offences."
