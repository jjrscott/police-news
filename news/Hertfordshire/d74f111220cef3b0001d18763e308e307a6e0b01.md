Fire, ambulance and police will be at the annual emergency services open day in Harpenden.

It takes place at **Harpenden Fire Station in Leyton Road from 11am to 3pm on Saturday July 27**.

A number of other organisations will be present on the day including emergency responders, Neighbourhood Watch and officers from the local police Safer Neighbourhood Team and Road Policing Unit. There will also be children's activities, stalls, displays and food and drink to purchase.

Leader of the St Albans and Harpenden Volunteer Police Cadets and Intervention Inspector Steve Alison said: "It's a great family event where visitors of all ages can watch safety demonstrations, get advice on a range of topics including crime prevention and fire safety and look inside emergency service vehicles. Come along and support your local emergency services."

The event has been organised by the St Albans and Harpenden Volunteer Police Cadets and Harpenden Fire Station.

Entry is free but donations are welcome. All money raised will go The Fire Fighters Charity and the St Albans and Harpenden Volunteer Police Cadets.
