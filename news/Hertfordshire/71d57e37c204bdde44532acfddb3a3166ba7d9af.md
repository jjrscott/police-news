Police are appealing for help to trace two men who are wanted.

Rikki Hasell, who is 26 years old and Robbie Hasell, who is 29 years old, are both wanted in connection with an unprovoked serious assault which occurred in Ware in the early hours of Saturday, May 19 outside The Lodge. Their last known address is High Road in Broxbourne.

The victim, a man aged in his 30s, was punched and kicked to the face leaving him with a number of fractures.

Rikki and Robbie have connections to Ware, Cheshunt, Broxbourne and Essex.

Anyone who has seen them or believes they know where they might be is asked to contact police on 101 or report information online.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
