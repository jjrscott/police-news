Police are appealing for witnesses and information after a lamppost was cut down in Borehamwood this morning (Saturday November 4).

The incident is believed to have taken place shortly before 10.30am on a public foot path that runs between Studio Way, near the Toby Carvery, and Shenley Road. A hacksaw has been used to cut down the lamppost.

PC Chris Humphreys, from the Hertsmere Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "I would like to speak to anyone who believes they saw any suspicious behaviour in that area.

"In particular I would like a member of the public who flagged down a police car near Potters Lane in relation to the incident to get in touch. He was a white man, who was walking a small brown dog."

*Two men have been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and theft and are currently in police custody while investigations continue.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the police on the non-emergency number 101, quoting incident reference number 250 of November 4.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
