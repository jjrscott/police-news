The Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit has launched a murder investigation following the death of a woman in Welwyn Garden City.

Police were called to a disturbance at an address in Fordwich Road at around 8pm yesterday (Saturday 24 August).The occupant, a woman in her 60s, had been assaulted and received serious injuries as a result.

Paramedics gave medical assistance to the victim but she was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

A 36 year old man and a 40 year old woman, both from Welwyn Garden City, have been arrested on suspicion of murder. They are currently in police custody.

At this time the incident is being treated as isolated and involving people known to each other. We are not looking for anyone else in connection with the woman's death.

A scene guard is currently in place at the address to allow officers to conduct initial enquiries into the circumstances that led to her death.
