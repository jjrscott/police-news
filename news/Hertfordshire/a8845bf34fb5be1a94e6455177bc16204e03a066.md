Police have released further CCTV images following a burglary in Buntingford.

Detective Constable Dieter Sweeting said: "We now have further images of the men we are trying to trace in connection with this burglary and the car which was seen outside the address. We know the men were in the area at the time and we need to speak to them as we believe that they could help us with our inquiries."
