Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a man who is wanted on recall to prison.

Dills Cooper, aged 23, whose last known address is Pilgrim House in Hertford is believed to be in the local area.

Anyone who sees him or has information about his whereabouts is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101, or report information online.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.

Wanted: Dills Cooper
