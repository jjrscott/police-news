Between 6.30pm and 6.45pm on Monday, February 18, two teenage boys were reportedly assaulted at McDonalds in Darkes Road.

Detective Constable Robert Wood, who is investigating, said: "From our enquiries, we know that several members of the public will have witnessed what happened. I'm appealing for anyone who was at McDonalds around the times stated and has not already spoken to police to get in touch as soon as possible."
