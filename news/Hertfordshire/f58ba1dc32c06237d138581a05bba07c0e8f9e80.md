Officers investigating an attempted burglary at a bank in Welwyn Garden City are releasing CCTV images of a man they would like to speak to as part of their enquiries.

Between 2pm on Saturday, October 14 and 9am on Monday, October 16, offender(s) caused damage to an internal wall, creating a hole, within HSBC Midland Bank in the Howardsgate.

Attempted burglary

PC Montgomery, who is investigating, said: "I appreciate that these CCTV images are not the best quality however, I am hoping that someone may recognise him from the clothing he is wearing as we believe he may have information that can help our investigation."

Anyone who recognises the man or has information that may assist the investigation is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference B1/17/4175, or report information online.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
