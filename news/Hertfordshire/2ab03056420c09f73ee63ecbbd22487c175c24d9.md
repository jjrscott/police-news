Officers investigating an alleged assault are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to get in contact.

At around 3am yesterday (Sunday, March 3) a man was reportedly assaulted in Maidenhead Street.

During an altercation between two groups of people, the victim, a man in his 20s, was allegedly punched in the side of the head and fell to the ground, losing consciousness.

He remains in hospital after sustaining a bleed on the brain and a fractured skull.

Any witnesses who haven't yet spoken to police or anyone with information should contact Detective Constable Shaun Turner on _shaun.turner@herts.pnn.police.uk_ or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/20231/19. You can also report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.

For over 30 years, Crimestoppers has always kept its promise of anonymity to everyone who contacts them.
