 * ### The men plead guilty ay St Albans Crown Court on 19 August

 * ### They were fined a total of £3,750

Three men have been fined after pleading guilty to hacking into a business competitor's computer system.

The men had gained access to a competitor's server and over a period of several years had studied software owned by the other company. All three pleaded guilty at St Albans Crown Court on Monday 19 August to conspiracy to commit unauthorised access to a computer.

The three, who all worked for a Hertford based company, were ordered to pay fines:

 * Matthew Etherington, 37, of Chandlers Ways, Hertford, was fined £1,500
 * James Entwisle, 42, of Westfield Close, Hitchin, was fined £1,500
 * Wayne Boltwood, 33, of Ashdown Drive, Crawley, was fined £750

Detective Constable Richard Bagworth, of Hertfordshire Constabulary's Serious Fraud and Cyber Unit, said: "These men were senior members of staff in a software development company and sought to gain a business advantage over a competitor.

"Although this kind of malpractice in the technology sector is complex in nature, we have demonstrated that it can be detected and we will pursue offenders. I hope that these fines handed out will deter other people from employing these kinds of business tactics."
