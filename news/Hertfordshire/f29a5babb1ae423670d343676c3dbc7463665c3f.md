Officers from the Beds, Cambs and Herts Road Policing Unit are appealing for witnesses and information following a serious road traffic collision on the A404 Wednesday 11 March.

The incident happened at around 12 noon. A blue Skoda Fabia was travelling along the A404 in the direction of Amersham, when it was in collision with a black VW Golf that was emerging from Green Street onto the A404.

Police, fire and ambulance crews attended the scene and the passenger in the Skoda, a lady in her seventies, was airlifted to the Royal Free Hospital in London with suspected back injuries. The driver of the Skoda - a man in his seventies, was taken to Watford General Hospital, along with the 90 year old driver of the Golf.

Road Policing Sergeant Sam Cordingley said: "We are very keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the collision or who saw either of the cars driving prior to it. We also want to speak to anyone who was driving in the area at the time and who had a dash cam in operation."

Anyone with any information should contact Sam via email or by calling the non-emergency number 101 and quoting ISR 303 of 11 March. You can also report information online.

The road is likely to be closed into the early evening.
