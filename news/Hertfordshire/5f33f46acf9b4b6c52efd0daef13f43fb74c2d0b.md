### Police are appealing for information and witnesses following an incident of grievous bodily harm (GBH) in Abbotts Langley.

Officers were called on Sunday, February 10, at around 8.30pm to Long Elms, Abbots Langley, where an 18 year old man had sustained life-changing injuries to his hand. Officers attended the scene and arrested two men. The victim was taken to hospital.

Sergeant Christopher Simmons, from the Abbots Langley Safer Neighbourhood Team who is investigating, said: "We have arrested a 21 year old man from Watford, who has now been charged with causing grievous bodily harm. He has been remanded into custody by the courts. A 17 year old man, also from Watford who was arrested nearby has been released under investigation.

"I would like to stress that we are not currently seeking anyone else in connection with this alleged offence and there is no increased risk to the wider public. We will be increasing patrols locally to provide reassurance and would like to encourage you to approach officers to discuss any concerns that you may have.
