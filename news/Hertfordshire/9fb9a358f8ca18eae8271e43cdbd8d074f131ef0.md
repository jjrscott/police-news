A man has been charged with a number of driving offences following an incident near Hemel Hempstead last week.

On Thursday 25 March, at around 12.05am, officers attempted to stop a vehicle on the A41 after police intelligence systems indicated that the owner of the vehicle was wanted for offences in another area.

The driver allegedly failed to stop and a pursuit ensued.

In order to minimise risk to the public, officers brought the vehicle to a tactical stop on the M1, near to the junction 8.

No one sustained any serious injuries.

Johnny Jude, aged 28 and from Barnet, appeared at Stevenage Magistrates' Court on Friday 26 March. He was charged with:

 * Failing to stop for police
 * Driving a vehicle dangerously
 * Driving whilst uninsured
 * Criminal damage
 * Theft
 * Common assault.

He was remanded into custody and will appear at St Albans Crown Court on Monday 26 April.
