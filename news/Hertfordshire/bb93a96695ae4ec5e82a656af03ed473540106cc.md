Police are appealing to members of the public to help trace two people who are wanted.

Daniel Giddings, aged 35, and Rachel Lovegrove, aged 44, whose last known address is Winnipeg Way in Turnford, are both wanted in connection with thefts from Sainsbury's in High Road, Broxbourne.

Anyone who sees them or knows of their whereabouts is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101 or report information online.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
