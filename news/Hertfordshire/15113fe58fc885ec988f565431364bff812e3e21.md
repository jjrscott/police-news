Officers are appealing for information and witnesses following an attempted burglary at a house in Mill End.

Between 2.35pm and 4.30pm on Monday (February 12) it is believed someone attempted to force entry to a property on Uxbridge Road, causing damage to the wooden front door.

PC Rowen Sheppard is investigating and said: "Thankfully the offenders did not gain access and nothing was taken however we believe some force was used to attempt to open the door so it would have probably made quite a noise and looked suspicious.

"Uxbridge Road is a busy main road so I believe there may be people who witnessed or may have seen someone acting suspiciously in the area.

"If you have information that could assist the investigation, please get in touch via the non-emergency number, 101 or through email ISR 787 of February 12."

You can also report information online.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form.
