Suspected Class A drugs were seized after officers executed a warrant at a property in Maple Cross on Wednesday (January 30).

Officers from both the Three Rivers Scorpion Team* and the Rickmansworth Safer Neighbourhood Team entered the address in Oakhill Road under Section 8 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.

The property was searched and a quantity of what is suspected to be cocaine, crack and heroin was seized, as well as cash and equipment believed to be used in the cultivation of cannabis (pictured).

No arrests were made however a man is helping officers with their enquiries.

PC Matt Ginty, from the Three Rivers Scorpion Team, said: "Yesterday's activity was part of our ongoing action to disrupt suspected drug crime and associated criminality.

"You can contact us in confidence if you believe there is drug crime being committed in your community, as this enables us to build up an intelligence picture and take the necessary action to bring these criminals to justice."
