* ### Volunteer Police Cadets delivered presents to elderly victims of crime across Hertfordshire.

 * ### Crime prevention advice was also given.

 * ### The presents were paid for through fund-raising

Presents were delivered to elderly residents as part of Hertfordshire Constabulary's annual Operation Christmas Cop scheme.

On Saturday (December 16), Volunteer Police Cadets from across the county joined 'Christmas Cop' to visit eight people who had been victims of crime and rogue trading.

The cadets gave out presents, which had been paid for by their fund-raising efforts throughout the year and issued winter crime prevention advice.

Sergeant Steve Alison, who leads the St Albans and Harpenden Cadet Unit and introduced the scheme, said: "This social action project is a fantastic way for the cadets to give something back to the community and to spread a bit of Christmas spirit to those most vulnerable at Christmas time."
