* ### Police want to speak to the man pictured following a fraud incident in Hertford's WH Smith store.

 * ### Officers believe the many may have information that can help their enquiries.

 * ### Anyone who recognises him is asked to contact PCSO Suzanne Morris.

Officers investigating an incident of fraud in Hertford are releasing an image of a man they'd like to speak to as part of their enquiries.

At around 5.35pm on Thursday, August 9, a man entered WH Smith in Bircherley Green where he had a dispute with one of the store cashiers over the change she had given him and deceived her into giving him more money than he was actually owed.

Anyone who recognises the man pictured is asked to contact PCSO Suzanne Morris by emailing, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/26123/18, or report information online.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
