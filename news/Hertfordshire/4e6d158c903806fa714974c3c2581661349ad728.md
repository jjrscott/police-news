Police investigating an attempted robbery in Hatfield are appealing for a potential witness to the incident to come forward.

An elderly man was walking through an alleyway near Birchwood Close when he was approached by two men who pushed him and demanded he hand over his medication.

It is believed they were then disturbed by a woman with a pushchair and made off empty-handed in the direction of St Albans Way.

The suspects are described as two black men, wearing hoods.

PC Duncan Hoskins said: "The incident occurred sometime between November 20 and 22, but the victim is unable to recall the exact date. I am appealing for the woman who walked through the alleyway to please get in touch as she may have information which could assist us with our enquiries."
