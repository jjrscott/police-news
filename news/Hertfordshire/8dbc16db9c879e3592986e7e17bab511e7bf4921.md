Sergeant Samuel Cordingley from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit said: "I am appealing for anyone who saw the events leading up to the incident, as well as anyone who saw the collision itself, to get in touch.

"The collision happened on a busy road and I believe there will have been many witnesses who can help us to understand the circumstances of the collision. Please do not hesitate to get in touch if you can help.

"If you've got dash cam footage of what happened I would also like to hear from you."
