We are appealing for witnesses and information following an assault in Hatfield yesterday (Tuesday 20 October).

Police were called to Aviation Avenue just before 4pm after a 17 year old boy was found with suspected stab wounds.

Officers, the East of England Ambulance Service and air ambulance attended.

The victim was taken to hospital for treatment to chest and leg wounds. His injuries are not believed to be life threatening or life changing at this time.

Detective Inspector Sophia Adams, of the Welwyn Hatfield Local Crime Unit, said: "Our enquiries into the incident are continuing at this time and, as part of this, we are appealing for anyone who saw what happened and hasn't yet spoken to police, to please come forward. Were you in Aviation Avenue at the time of this incident? If so I would like to hear from you.

"I'm particularly keen to trace a taxi driver who we believe may have witnessed the assault.

"We would like to reassure the community that we believe this to be an isolated incident between parties known to each other.

"Additionally, we are increasing our patrols in the area following this incident to provide extra reassurance to members of the public.

"If you are able to help I can be contacted directly via email at sophia.adams@herts.pnn.police.uk"
