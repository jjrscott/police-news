Officers investigating a burglary in Watford are appealing for information and witnesses.

It happened on Sheepcot Lane between 11am and 10.30pm on Saturday, August 18.

Offenders forced entry to the property before stealing a quantity of jewellery and making off in an unknown direction.

Detective Constable Judith Muskett, from the Watford Local Crime Unit, said: "I appreciate some time has passed since this incident but the items that were stolen are of huge sentimental value to the victim.

"If you saw any suspicious activity in Sheepcot Lane, or have recently been offered any gold jewellery for sale, we would like to hear from you."

Any witnesses or anyone with information should contact DC Muskett on judith.muskett@herts.pnn.police.uk or the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/28881/18. You can also report information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
