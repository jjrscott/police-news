Police are releasing a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to as part of enquiries following an incident at a snooker club in St Albans.

At around 1.30am on Monday, February 4, a man was assaulted at The Raging Bull Snooker Club. The victim was punched several times by the offender who then picked up a stool and threw it across the bar causing damage to glasses. The offender was also aggressive to other customers before leaving.

Officers would like to speak to the man pictured as he may have information that could assist the on-going enquiries.

Anyone who recognises him or has information that could assist the investigation is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/11155/19, or report information online.

Alternatively, you can stay anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form.
