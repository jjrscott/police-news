Police are appealing for witnesses following a fatal road traffic collision in Hitchin in the early hours of Saturday (April 14) morning.

At around 3.35am, a black Vauxhall Insignia driving on Sun Street has collided with a pedestrian at the junction with Bridge Street.

The pedestrian - a 21-year-old man from Hitchin - suffered serious injuries. He was treated by paramedics but sadly was pronounced dead at the scene shortly after 4.30am.

The incident is being investigated by the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit.

Sgt Martin Kemp said: "It is believed that the pedestrian had been lying in the road prior to the collision taking place, however I would like to speak to anyone who saw him or the vehicle just prior to the collision.

"In particular, we would like to speak to two passengers who were in the vehicle at the time of the collision but we have not yet been able to speak to directly."

Anyone with information is asked to contact police via the non-emergency number 101, quoting incident reference ISR 103 of April 14, or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/report.
