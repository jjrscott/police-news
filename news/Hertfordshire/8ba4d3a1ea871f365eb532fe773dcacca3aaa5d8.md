Officers investigating an incident of indecent exposure are releasing an e-fit of a suspect and are appealing for the public's help to identify him.

At around 1pm on Friday, January 19, the victim was waiting at a bus stop in Batchwood Drive, St Albans, when the offender approached the bus stop where he sat down, exposed himself and touched himself inappropriately.

Detective Constable Paul Edmondson, who is investigating, said: "The victim in this case was understandably left upset and shaken by the incident.

"I'm appealing for anyone who recognises the man pictured to get in touch as you may have information that can assist our investigation."
