Police are releasing CCTV images of a man they would like to speak to as part of enquiries following a robbery in Watford.

Between 11.45am and midday on Saturday, February 17, the victim - a man aged in his 80s - was leaving Sainsbury's on his mobility scooter when he was approached in Albert Road South. The offender grabbed the victim by his shirt and took his wallet before making off.

Anyone who recognises the man pictured is asked to contact Detective Sergeant Matthew Waylett by email, call the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference C1/18/966 or report information online.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
