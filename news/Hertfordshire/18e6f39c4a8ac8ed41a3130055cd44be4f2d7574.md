Police investigating an aggravated burglary that occurred at Ladbrokes in Baldock are appealing for information and witnesses.

Just after 8.30pm on Monday (February 18) a man entered the bookmakers in Whitehorse Street and demanded money.

Cash was taken from a till and a safe before the offender left.

Detective Sergeant Will Ainsworth, who is investigating, said: "Thankfully no-one was hurt during the burglary but the staff member was obviously left shaken by his ordeal.

"The offender was wearing a distinctive mask covering his face (similar to the image attached) so he would have undoubtedly stuck in the minds of anyone who saw him going into or leaving the bookmakers on Monday evening.

"I'm appealing for anyone who believes they saw the offender or has any information that could assist our enquiries to get in touch. If you have a vehicle with a dash cam fitted that was in the local vicinity please check your footage and make contact if you believe you've captured anything that could help us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact DS Ainsworth by emailing _william.ainsworth@herts.pnn.police.uk_ , calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/16185/19 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
