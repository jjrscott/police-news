Police are appealing for information and witnesses following a burglary in Bishop's Stortford.

At around 8.25pm on Thursday, September 20, offender(s) gained access to a home in Redvers Close and searched inside.

A quantity of jewellery that is of sentimental value to the victim was taken along with a security box, which contained paperwork.

The offenders - described as three white men dressed in black and wearing balaclavas - were seen jumping over a garden wall and leaving the street at speed in a black vehicle.

Detective Constable Aby Page, who is investigating, said: "I'm appealing for anyone who may have seen the men in the neighbourhood, witnessed them making off in a black vehicle, or saw a black vehicle driving at speed in the local area around the time stated to get in touch.

"I'd also like to hear from anyone who may have seen the security box, which we believe could have been dumped as it contained nothing of value to the thieves.

"If you have been offered jewellery for sale in suspicious circumstances please also get in touch as you may have information that could help the investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact DC Page by emailing abygail.page@herts.pnn.police.uk, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/38723/18 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
