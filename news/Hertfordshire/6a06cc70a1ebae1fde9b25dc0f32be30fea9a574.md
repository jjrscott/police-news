* ### Rural police stay busy in Royston area as more people enjoy the outdoors

 * ### Officers issue advice about how to stay safe in the countryside during the busy farming season

 * ### Local teams carry out speed enforcement as motorists continue to drive too fast through villages around Royston

Hertfordshire's Rural Safer Neighbourhood Teams have been busy making sure people remain safe and adhere to government guidelines, following the easing of restrictions around taking exercise and spending time outside.

"Naturally we have seen a big increase in the number of people accessing the beautiful countryside in North Herts, thanks to the good weather and the relaxing of some of the guidelines about where and when to exercise," explained Neighbourhood Inspector James Lant.

"I want to reassure all of our communities that my teams are working hard to make sure people not only stay safe when they are out and about, but that they remain considerate and responsible when enjoying the countryside.

"This is a difficult time for our rural communities, including farmers, who have had to manage a huge increase in people using footpaths that often cross their land, or straying into areas that are not available to the public. And this is at a time when they are working hard to keep food supplies available and coping with increased demand.

In the rural areas around Hitchin, local officers have been carrying out additional patrols, using the quad bikes and off-road vehicles. These allow good access to the more remote areas in particular the tracks where the walkers and cyclist frequent.

Additionally, local officers have also been supported by the constabulary's Rural Operational Support Team (ROST) who continue to conduct regular patrols.

Rosalind David, County Adviser for the National Farmers' Union in Hertfordshire added: "As we move into the warmer months, farmers will be increasing their activity in the fields as they prepare their crops for harvesting in July and August. Agricultural machinery will be working in the fields at all times of the day, and we ask people to use the official public rights of way in their local area, rather than straying into areas with growing crops. As well as preventing damage to crops, which ultimately go to producing food, it is also important to stay safe when in the countryside, especially if there is large agricultural machinery operating nearby.

"We would advise people to plan their routes before going out to enjoy the countryside, especially if you are visiting a new location. Please keep to marked footpaths or other rights of way and remember to follow the Countryside Code. Also, be alert, as you could be sharing a path or track with agricultural vehicles or other farming machinery."

Hertfordshire Constabulary and the Hertfordshire NFU have issued the following advice for those visiting rural areas:

 * Always keep dogs on a lead around livestock - especially sheep and remember that farmers are well within their rights to take measures (including shooting out of control dogs) to protect their animals.
 * Always use official marked rights of way
 * Leave gates as you find them
 * Never feed horses or other animals you may come across on your walks - many plants can be harmful to livestock and horses.
 * Do not block access to farmland with your vehicle or park in narrow lanes. Farm vehicles and equipment can be wider than the average car, and emergency vehicles need access at all times.
 * Do not park on private land.
 * Be considerate when walking or cycling through livestock, as this can sometimes cause unnecessary distress and alarm.
 * Be aware of your surroundings - agricultural vehicles and equipment could be operating nearby

Sergeant Lee Jessup from the Royston Rural Safer Neighbourhood Team said: "My teams have been busy making sure that visitors to our countryside continue to adhere to the government's guidelines. I am pleased to say that most people seem to be doing the right thing when using the countryside, however we will continue to take action where necessary.

"Unfortunately, road users are not always being as considerate, and we have noticed an increase in the number of people driving at speed on country lanes and through our villages. We will be increasing our speed monitoring patrols and those caught exceeding the limits will be dealt with robustly.

"With more people out and about enjoying the countryside at this time, adhering to the speed limits and driving with due care and attention are essential."
