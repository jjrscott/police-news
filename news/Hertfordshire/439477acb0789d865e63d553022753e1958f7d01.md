Police investigating an arson in Hemel Hempstead, during which a vehicle sustained substantial damage, are appealing for witnesses and information.

The incident occurred in Bracknell Place, at around 7.30pm on Thursday, November 9 when a Volvo was set alight.

PC Karl Diggins, from the Safer Neighbourhood Team said: "At this moment in time we have exhausted all lines of enquiries. I am appealing for anyone with information about the incident to please come forward. Did you witness anything suspicious around the time? Any information, no matter how seemingly insignificant, could greatly assist our enquiries."
