A property marking event is to take place in Croxley Green this Saturday (September 1).

Officers from the Safer Neighbourhood Team will be situated outside the shops in Baldwins Lane between 10am and 1pm and will be marking items, such as bicycles and tools, free of charge.

PCSO Daisy Jenkins said: "Marking items in this way makes them less attractive to thieves as they are harder to sell on. It also means that, if items are ever lost or stolen and subsequently recovered, they can be more easily reunited with their rightful owner.

"We'll also be giving out crime prevention advice on a range of topics so pop along and say hello."
