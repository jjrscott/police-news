This month will see the launch of 'Coffee with a Cop' in Watford town centre.

The community engagement event has proved popular in other parts of the county and allows members of the public to meet with local officers, to discuss any issues and get crime prevention advice.

On Monday 14 October, officers will be stationed at Starbucks in Cineworld, inside the Intu centre, between 10am and 1pm.

Town centre Sergeant Ellie Berry said: "This is a perfect opportunity for residents and shoppers to come along and meet with members of the Safer Neighbourhood Team. We'll also be issuing crime prevention advice on a range of topics to help people keep themselves and their property safe. We're looking forward to meeting people on the day."

Details of further events will be advertised in due course.
