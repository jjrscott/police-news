Police have arrested a man in connection with an armed robbery that is reported to have occurred in Much Hadham on Monday (December 3).

The 46 year old from Harlow in Essex was arrested yesterday (Friday, December 7) on suspicion of robbery and remains in police custody at this time.

Officers were called at 1.53pm on Monday to reports of a robbery at the Londis store in Tower Hill. It is alleged that the offender approached the Post Office counter with a gun and demanded cash.

A quantity of money was reportedly handed over by the cashier before the offender left. No-one was hurt during the incident.

Anyone with information that could assist the on-going investigation is asked to contact the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/62224/18 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/report.
