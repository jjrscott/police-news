Detectives have released CCTV images of two men they would like to speak to in connection with a burglary in Potters Bar.

Police were called at 12.24pm on Thursday, February 21 to reports of a break in at a property in St Vincents Way.

It is believed that the offenders smashed the window of a rear property door and once inside conducted an untidy search.

The alarm system was also damaged and a quantity of jewellery and watches stolen.

The offenders ran out towards Barnet Road and made off in a grey Audi down Hill Rise and onto Southgate Road towards the M25.

Officers are keen to speak to the two men pictured as they believe they may have information which could help the investigation.
