Police have released CCTV images of two people they would like to speak to following a GBH in Welwyn Garden City.

The incident happened just before 6.30pm on Thursday, May 31, outside a block of flats in Westfield.

During the incident, the victim - a 39 year old man - was chased by two men before he jumped from a balcony in the communal area of the flats.

The offenders then assaulted the victim as he lay on the floor. He sustained a broken ankle from the jump and was taken to hospital. He also sustained cuts and bruises during the assault.

Officers would like to speak to the men pictured as it is believed they were in the area at the time and could have vital information to assist with the investigation.

Anyone who recognises the men, or has any other information about the incident, should contact Hertfordshire Constabulary on the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/3014/18.
