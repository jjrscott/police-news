Officers are appealing for information and witnesses following a burglary in Watford.

At around 6.15pm on Friday 22 November, offender(s) gained access to a house in Garston Lane.

The occupant, who was upstairs at the time, heard noises including a male voice talking. As he went downstairs to investigate he heard a smashing sound. Once downstairs, he found the rear kitchen door had been smashed and left ajar.

Detective Constable Julie Vint, who is investigating, said: "Thankfully the offender(s) were disturbed before they could steal anything, but this was understandably a very unsettling experience for the victim.

"I am appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time and might have seen what happened, or witnessed suspicious behaviour, to get in touch. If you can help, please call the non-emergency number 101 or email me at _Julie.Vint@herts.pnn.police.uk_ quoting crime reference 41/105521/19."

You can also report information online at herts.police.uk/report or speak to an operator in our Force Communications Room via our online web chat at herts.police.uk/contact.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
