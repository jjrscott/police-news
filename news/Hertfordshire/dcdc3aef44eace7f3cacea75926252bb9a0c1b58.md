Officers are appealing for witnesses and information following an alleged assault that happened in Watford last week.

At around 2.20pm on Thursday 6 February, two delivery drivers - who had both been driving white vans - were involved a verbal altercation just off Beecham Grove.

One of the men was then reportedly punched in the face, causing injuries amounting to ABH.

DC Mark Emerson, who is investigating, said: "Understandably, the victim has been left shaken up following the incident. I'm now appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the incident taking place, or anyone who has any information they think could assist our investigation, to please get in contact. Even something that may seem relatively minor or insignificant could be vital to us solving this case."

Anyone with information is asked to contact DC Emerson directly via email at mark.emerson@herts.pnn.police.uk.
