Two men were arrested last night in South Mimms on suspicion of conspiracy to steal motor vehicles. Eight Range Rovers have been stolen in the Harpenden area in the last two weeks.

The men arrested are a 34-year-old man and a 32-year-old man, both from Essex.

The 32-year-old was further arrested on suspicion of driving whilst under the influence of drugs and having no driving licence. They are currently in police custody.

Residents are still encouraged to make sure they use preventative measures to help reduce the chances of their vehicles being stolen.

Hertfordshire Constabulary advises:

 * park a second car in front of your Range Rover.
 * park it close to movement activated lights.
 * use a crook lock.
 * look at options to either upgrade or install tracker systems.
 * keep your keys in a faraday bag even when you are out of the house to avoid your key being cloned.
