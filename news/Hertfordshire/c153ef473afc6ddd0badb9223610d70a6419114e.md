Police investigating a theft in Rickmansworth are releasing an image of a woman they would like to speak to for help with their enquiries.

At around 11am on January 26, a woman was using the internal cash machine at Nationwide bank in the High Street and had inserted her card and entered the pin, when a woman walked over and said "you can't get money out of that machine".

The woman who walked over handed the victim her bank card from the machine after pressing on the screen and withdrawing £250 without the victim seeing.

Officers would like to speak with the person pictured as she may have information which could assist their investigation.

Any witnesses or anyone with information should contact PCSO Waller on _allan.waller@herts.pnn.police.uk_ or the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/8988/19. You can also report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report
