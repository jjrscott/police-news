Officers investigating a burglary in Watford are appealing for anyone who recognises the stolen property pictured or anyone with information to get in contact.

On Saturday, January 19, a property in Parkside Drive was broken into and an untidy search was conducted.

A rear window was forced open to gain entry.

Items stolen include (all pictured):

 * Three sets of law enforcement cuff links from the USA
 * A box containing a tie pin
 * Two watches
 * A number of necklaces and other jewellery

DC Jon Holmes from the Watford Local Crime Unit, said: "The jewellery that was stolen is quite distinctive and we believe it is very rare in the UK.

"If you have seen this jewellery or witnessed this crime, please contact me on _jonathan.holmes@herts.pnn.police.uk_ or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/6152/19."
