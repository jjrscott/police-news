* ### Motorists warned over bogus email claiming they have been caught speeding

 * ### Thought to be an attempt to extort money from innocent drivers

 * ### Anyone who receives this email is asked to contact Action Fraud

__The Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire (BCH) Cameras, Tickets and Collisions (CTC) unit are warning motorists to be aware of a recent speeding ticket scam.

It has been brought to our attention that a bogus email is being sent to members of the public in an attempt to extort money from them by indicating that they have been caught speeding.

The letter or email is presented as below and is designed to make it look like it has come from a police force, as below:

If you receive an email of this nature, do not click on any links within the body of the email text and instead take a screen shot of it before reporting it directly to Action Fraud.

There is an official process for issuing fixed penalty notices for speeding offences in Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire.

A legitimate Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) would never display the GOV.UK logo. The Road Traffic Act 1988 states that the notice must be served 14 days after the alleged offence in the form of a physical letter sent via first class post.

A NIP sent from Bedfordshire Police, Cambridgeshire Constabulary or Hertfordshire Constabulary would always display the CTC unit's logo and contact details.
