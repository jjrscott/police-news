Officers are releasing an image of two people they would like to speak to as part of their enquiries after a woman was bitten by a dog in Kimpton.

At around 3.15pm on Sunday, March 25, the victim - a woman aged in her 50s - was out running when she was bitten on the wrist by a dog in Kimpton Road.

PC David Hine, who is investigating, said: "I'd like to speak to the two people pictured as I believe they may have information that could help our enquiries."

If you are one of the people pictured or recognise these two people please contact PC Hine by emailing, call the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference G1/18/974 or report information online.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
