Officers are releasing CCTV images of two people they would like to speak to as part of their enquiries following an incident of making off without payment at a beauty salon.

Between 5pm and 6.30pm on Friday, February 1, two offenders had nail treatments at USA Nails and Spa in The Hall Walk, London Road, Berkhamsted, before leaving without paying. They told staff that they were going to the cash machine to get money out but instead ran off.

Police would like to speak to the two women pictured as they believe they may have information that could assist the investigation.

Anyone who recognises them is asked to contact PCSO Lauren Jackson by emailing _lauren.jackson@herts.pnn.police.uk_ , alternatively report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/10476/19.

Alternatively, you can stay anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
