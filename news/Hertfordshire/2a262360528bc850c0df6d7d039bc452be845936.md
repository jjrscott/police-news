Police are appealing for information and witnesses following an arson at a nursery school in Hoddesdon.

The incident occurred at Rye Park Nursery School in Walton Road on Sunday (February 3) between 4.30pm and 4.40pm when it is believed someone placed a lit piece of paper into a bin.

The small fire caused damage to the bin and the wall it was attached to.

PC Thomas Leask, who is investigating, said: "The school was closed at the time so no one was put at risk and the damage caused to the property was superficial, however we need to establish who was responsible.

"I am appealing for anyone who might have seen what happened, or may have seen suspicious activity in the area around the time of the fire, to get in touch.

"If you've got information, no matter how small it might seem, call me via the non-emergency number 101 or email me at _Thomas.leask@herts.pnn.police.uk_ quoting crime reference 41/11050/19."
