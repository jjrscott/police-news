The atmosphere was electric as Police Community Support Officers from Watford engaged with local schoolchildren during a large-scale slot car racing event.

Forty pupils from Nascot Wood Junior School took part, alongside PCSOs Marc Abbott, Nikki Peaty and Sue Lowther, from the Safer Neighbourhood Team. The officers were on hand to speak to the pupils about a range of topics throughout the day, including keeping themselves safe.

PCSO Abbott, who organised the event for the second year running, said: "As local officers it's really important that we engage with people of all ages, in order to help forge lasting relationships and show that the police are there to help. This was a great event and allowed us to meet with younger members of our community in a fun way. We hope to hold similar events in future."
