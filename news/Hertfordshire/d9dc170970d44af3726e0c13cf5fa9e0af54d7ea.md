* ### Officers supporting 2 Wheels campaign release footage

 * ### Video shows a collision involving a motorbike and a car

 * ### The head on collision occurred in Stevenage

**As part of the current 2 Wheels campaign to improve the safety of motorcyclists on our roads, the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit are releasing footage of a collision involving a motorcyclist in Stevenage.**

**The head-on crash happened at around 5pm on 23 March 2019 on Broadwater Crescent and involved a motorbike and a car. The rider was nearly twice the drink drive limit.**

**He was critically injured and airlifted to hospital.**

**The car was travelling within the speed limits and the two people in it were not injured.**

**The video can be viewed here.**

**PC David Burstow investigated the case and said: "We are releasing this footage in the hope it brings some reality, particularly to motorcyclists, of the serious consequences of being over the limit.**

**" The rider put himself, the occupants of the car and other road users at risk and this is not acceptable.**

**" I appreciate he is now paying for his actions not only through the courts but through the injuries he has suffered. The message from us is clear - do not drink and drive."**

**At court in July, the motorcyclist was disqualified from driving for 18 months.**
