Police in Borehamwood hosted a bike and tool marking event in Aberford Park yesterday (Wednesday).

Marking bicycles and tools makes them less attractive to thieves as they are harder to sell on. It also makes it easier to return the items to the rightful owners if they are ever lost or stolen and later recovered by police.

Yesterday, officers from the Safer Neighbourhood Team marked 12 bicycles, one mobility scooter, two children's scooters and a toddler's trike as well as giving out crime prevention advice to local families.

Several residents also signed up to OWL (Online Watch Link) - which is part of our Neighbourhood Watch scheme and keeps local people up to date with recent crimes as well as offering advice on how to reduce your chances of becoming a victim of crime.

PCSO Marie Harvey, from the Borehamwood Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "This was a great opportunity to meet with local residents, share some crime prevention advice and mark up their valuable belongings including new bicycles that children had received for Christmas so that they're less attractive to thieves."
