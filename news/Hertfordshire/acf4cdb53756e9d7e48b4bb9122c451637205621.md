Officers investigating an incident of shoplifting are releasing a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to as part of their enquiries.

Between 5.50pm and 6pm on Wednesday, May 30, an offender entered the Co-op store in Leeming Road, Borehamwood, filled a basket with items and left the shop without paying.

PCSO William Ryan, from the Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "I'd like to speak to the man pictured as I believe he was in the store around the time of the offence and may have information that can assist our enquiries."

Anyone who recognises the man pictured is asked to contact PCSO Ryan by emailing william.ryan@herts.pnn.police.uk, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/2576/18 or report information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report.
