Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a man who is wanted.

Jamie Weston, aged 25, whose last known address is Broom Walk, Stevenage, is wanted on recall to prison.

He also has links to the Kings Cross area of London.

Anyone who has seen Jamie or has information about his whereabouts is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101 or report information online.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.

Wanted: Jamie Weston
