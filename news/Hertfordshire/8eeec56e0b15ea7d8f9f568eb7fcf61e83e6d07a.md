Police are releasing CCTV images of a woman they would like to speak to as part of enquiries following an incident of shoplifting in Royston.

At around 2.15pm on Tuesday, October 16, an offender entered Tesco Express in Market Hill and stole a bottle of whiskey, before leaving the store and walking along the A10 London Road.

Officers believe the woman pictured may have information that can assist the investigation.

Anyone who recognises her or has any information that could help police is asked to contact PC Nicole Goodyer by emailing _Nicole.Goodyer@herts.pnn.police.uk_ , calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/46847/18 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
