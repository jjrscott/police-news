Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a man who is wanted.

Patrick O'Leary, aged 29, whose last known address is in North London, is wanted in connection with an assault that occurred in Cheshunt on February 3.

Anyone who has seen Patrick or knows of his whereabouts is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary online at www.herts.police.uk/Report _, speak to an operator in our Force Communications Room via our online web chat at_herts.police.uk/contact or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/11110/19.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
