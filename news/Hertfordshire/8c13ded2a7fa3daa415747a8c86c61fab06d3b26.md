Officers investigating an assault in Stevenage are appealing for information and witnesses.

Between 12.10pm and 12.50pm on Tuesday, December 18, an altercation between a man and woman occurred on the Number 1 Arriva bus travelling from Chells Manor to Stevenage town centre.

It was reported that the woman slapped and kicked a buggy that the victim - a 24 year old man - had with him and then threw a cartoon of orange juice at him, which hit him on the head.

PC Anthony Martin, who is investigating, said: "I'd like to speak to anyone who was on the bus at the time and witnessed this incident as you may have information that can help our enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact PC Martin by emailing anthony.martin@herts.pnn.police.uk, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/67110/18 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, you can stay 100 per cent anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
