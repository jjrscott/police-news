* ## Officers speak to students at North Herts College as part of Operation Edge.

 * ## A special presentation clarifies the dangers and consequences of carrying a knife.

 * ## Operation Edge - Stevenage against knife crime.

Students at North Herts College were the latest pupils to receive knife crime advice as part of Stevenage Police's Operation Edge Awareness programme.

Launched in 2018 in response to the increase in reported knife incidents in the town, Operation Edge aims to educate young people about the dangers and consequences of carrying knives.

The operation was kick-started with a schools competition, which saw students make their own educational knife awareness films. Now the operation is focusing on reinforcing these messages with special visits into schools to speak directly to pupils.

PCSO Nicky Lewis, who led the talk, said: "A key part of our strategy is educating young people that carrying a knife is illegal and makes you much more likely to be injured or arrested. It is not glamourous or tough and you are more likely to become involved in a violent incident or be arrested, even if you are acting in self-defence. Carrying a knife does not make you safer."
