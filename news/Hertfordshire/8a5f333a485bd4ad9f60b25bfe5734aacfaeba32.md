A man has been sentenced to 15 months in prison for sub-letting a property that he was renting.

Anthony Nwadike-Spencer, 50, of Hillside Crescent, Cheshunt, rented a property in Cheshunt from the landlord. He subsequently sought to sub-let the property to a third party without the knowledge or permission of the owner.

The landlord of the property had given Mr Nwadike-Spencer notice to leave the property in September 2015, however he then advertised the property for rent and took a deposit from a potential tenant.

Following an investigation Mr Nwadike-Spencer was arrested in August 2016 and charged with fraud by false representation.

Nwadike-Spencer appeared at St Albans Crown Court on Monday February 5. He was found guilty and sentenced to 15 month in prison and ordered to repay the victim back the deposit money they had paid.

Detective Inspector for Broxbourne, Tom Leeks, said: "Where it is established that the treatment of a tenant by someone acting as a landlord amounts to a criminal offence, working with partners will we will pro-actively act to intervene. I hope that this custodial sentence sends a clear message that anyone committing fraud will be dealt with and very likely end up in prison."
