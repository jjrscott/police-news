* ### Detectives appeal for help following aggravated burglary in Stevenage.

 * ### Offender was wearing a distinctive black wrestling style mask.

 * ### Elderly victim threatened and cash and tobacco taken.

Detectives in Stevenage are appealing for witnesses and information after a masked offender broke into a home in Stevenage and threatened the victim inside.

At around 2.30am on Wednesday June 27, the offender entered a property in Jessop Road and confronted the occupant, a 68 year old man who was up listening to the radio. The offender demanded money and searched the property leaving with a small amount of change and some tobacco.

The offender is described as a black man who was wearing a very distinctive black wrestling mask. He was of slim build, around 6ft tall, wearing a grey hoodie and light coloured denim jeans. He spoke with a foreign accent.

Officers from the Stevenage Local Crime Unit are appealing for anyone with any information to get in touch as soon as possible. Detective Sergeant Fay Tooley said: "Fortunately the victim was not harmed during this incident, but it was a very frightening experience and he is understandably very shaken.

"We are hoping that someone may have some information which could help this inquiry. Does anyone you know have a wrestling mask or have you seen anyone with a mask like this."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact DS Fay Tooley on 101 quoting crime reference number 41/11491/18. Or you can report online

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
