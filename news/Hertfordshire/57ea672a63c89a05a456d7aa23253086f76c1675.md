Detectives are appealing for information following a robbery in Hemel Hempstead.

At around 8.30pm on Friday 30 August, an elderly lady was walking through an alleyway between the NCP car park and the old Royal Bank of Scotland, towards the Marlowes, when she was approached by a female who asked if she could change a Â£10 note.

As the victim got her purse out, the female pushed the victim into the wall and snatched her purse from her, before running off towards Iceland.

The suspect is described as white, aged in her late teens to early 20s, of medium build, with shoulder length fair hair. She was wearing a dark jacket.Investigator
