Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a man who is wanted.

Michael Welsh, aged 31, is wanted in connection with the breach of a restraining order.

He has connections with Harlow and Wormley.

Anyone who has seen Michael or knows of his whereabouts is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/26176/18 or report information online.

Alternatively, contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
