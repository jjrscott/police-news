"As part of this, Operation Scorpion teams have been conducting patrols in neighbourhoods to identify any suspicious behaviour. My message to thieves who are considering coming to Three Rivers to target homes is to think twice as we will arrest you.

"I'd also like to remind residents to report any suspicious behaviour to police by calling the non-emergency number 101 or submit details online at www.herts.police.uk/report.
