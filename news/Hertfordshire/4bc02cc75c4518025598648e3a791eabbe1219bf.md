Police are appealing for information and witnesses after a van was stolen in Ware.

At around 11.10am on Wednesday, October 17, a white Ford Transit van, which was being used to carry out deliveries, was left unattended for a short time in Hoe Lane as the driver made his first delivery.

The offender - a man described as being white and aged 25 to 35 - got into the van and drove it away.

PC Nathan Lambert, who is investigating, said: "I'd like to speak to anyone who may have witnessed the van being stolen or thinks they have seen it since it was taken.

"In particular, I am keen to speak to a lady dog walker who helped the victim immediately after the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact PC Lambert by emailing nathan.lambert@herts.pnn.police.uk, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/47129/18 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
