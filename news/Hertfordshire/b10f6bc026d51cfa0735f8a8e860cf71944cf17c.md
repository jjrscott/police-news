Police are appealing to trace two people who stopped their car on Ludwick Way in Welwyn Garden City as they may have witnessed a sexual assault.

Officers from the Sexual Offences Investigation Team are investigating a report of an assault occurring between 2am and 3am on Saturday September 2.

Two men and the woman were walking along the road when it is alleged the men assaulted the woman, aged 25, on a green. It is believed a passing car pulled up and briefly spoke to the group before driving off. It is believed that a man and a woman were in the vehicle.

Investigator Pearl Devonshire said: "We are keen to trace these two who stopped to speak to the group see if everything was ok. They may have information about the incident that can help us with our enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact the police on the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference B1/17/3575.

Alternatively, if you have any information about this incident you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
