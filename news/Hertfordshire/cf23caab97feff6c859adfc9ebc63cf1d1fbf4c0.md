A knife was recovered in Hixberry Lane in St Albans at 2pm yesterday (Monday July 2).

A 14-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of possession of a knife and he has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

St Albans Neighbourhood Inspector Jon Roche said: "Knives can be very dangerous as we have seen recently with the two stabbings over the past few weeks in the St Albans district. We are determined to deal robustly with knives to safeguard young people. If you suspect anyone is carrying a knife, please get in touch with us. We do not want to see any more young people being injured in the district. Parents, please speak to your children about the irreversible consequences of carrying and using knives."

Please call 101 if you wish to report someone with a knife or report online
