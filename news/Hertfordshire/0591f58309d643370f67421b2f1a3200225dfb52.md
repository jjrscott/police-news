A French bulldog has been reunited with its owner three months after being stolen from a car parked at the Noke Thistle Hotel.

The dog called Roxy was tracked down in Slough last week (Tuesday April 30) by Thames Valley Police during a routine enquiry.

St Albans Neighbourhood Sergeant Paul Caro said: "The family were so surprised, but overjoyed to see Roxy after such a long time. The owner's young daughter was especially thrilled to see her beloved dog. She had been well looked after and was in good health, having been checked over by a vet at the weekend.

Roxy was stolen from a white Ford transit on the afternoon of Wednesday January 23. The window had been smashed.

Thames Valley Police are continuing enquiries into the theft of Roxy.
