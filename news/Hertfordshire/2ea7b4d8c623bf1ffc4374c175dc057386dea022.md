Officers have recovered a significant amount of items that are believed to have been stolen including tools, lawnmowers, bicycles and suitcases and are appealing to the public to help reunite the property with the rightful owners.

PC Ben Stratton said: "This property is believed to originate from the Colchester area of Essex and is thought to have been stolen from vehicles between October 29 and November 1 last year. We recovered the items from a stolen van in the Watford area and would like to reunite them with their rightful owners.

"If you believe any of the property pictured may belong to you please get in touch with me by emailing _ben.stratton@herts.pnn.police.uk_ , calling the non-emergency number 101 or online at www.herts.police.uk/Report."
