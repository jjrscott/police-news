* ### 15 year old boy arrested following incident at Oval.

 * ### 15 year old victim suffers stab wound.

 * ### Police appeal for witnesses.

A 15 year old boy has been arrested on suspicion of GBH with intent following an incident at the Oval on Monday October 15.

At around 8.30pm two 15 year old boys were engaged in an argument, which then escalated and resulted in one of the boys receiving a stab wound.

He was taken to the Lister Hospital and has since undergone treatment.

The other 15 year old boy is currently in police custody and is due to be released on police bail later today.

Investigating Officer Detective Sergeant Bianca Broadbent said: "We are appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time and who may have witnessed these two boys, before or after the incident, to contact us a soon as possible. We believe the argument may have started on the walkway behind the shops."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact DS Broadbent on 101 or report online quoting crime reference number 41/46782/18.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
