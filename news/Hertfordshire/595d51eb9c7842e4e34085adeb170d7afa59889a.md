Officers are appealing for the public's help to trace a man who is wanted.

Reddy Mfinda, age 26 and whose last known address is in the Colindale area, is wanted in connection with three residential burglaries that happened in Bushey between Friday 20 September and Thursday 26 September 2019.

Mfinda has links to the Colindale and Cricklewood areas of London.

If you have seen Mfinda or have information on his whereabouts, report it online at herts.police.uk/report, speak to an operator in our Force Communications Room via our online web chat at herts.police.uk/contact or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/87359/19.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
