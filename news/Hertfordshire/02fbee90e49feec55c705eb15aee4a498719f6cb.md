Police in Bishop's Stortford are appealing for help to trace two men they would like to speak to in connection with a series of thefts from vehicles in the St Michaels Mead area.

Officers believe the men in the photo could have information which will help the investigation.

Anyone who recognises the men pictured or has any other information about the thefts is asked to contact PCSO Natasha Coppin via the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/60833/18. You can also report information online.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form. In over 30 years, Crimestoppers charity has always kept its promise of anonymity to everyone who contacts them.

Motorists are reminded to make sure their vehicles are completely secure when they leave them unattended, all valuable items have been removed and nothing has been left on display.
