Police are appealing for information and witnesses following the theft of a bicycle from Bishop's Stortford.

The bike, pictured, had been left secured to a cycle rack in Riverside near to the Jackson Square car park on the afternoon of Wednesday, September 19. At around 3.30pm offender(s) approached the bike rack and broke the bike lock before leaving with the bike. They cycled through the ground floor of the Jackson Square car park towards The Causeway.

Anyone who saw the theft, has seen the bicycle since it was stolen or believes they may have been offered it for sale is asked to contact PCSO Adam Pemberton by emailing. Or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/38303/18 or report information online.

Alternatively, contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
