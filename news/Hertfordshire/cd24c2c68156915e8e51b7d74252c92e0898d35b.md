* ### The events will take place at the police station.

 * ### Marking your bike makes it less attractive to thieves.

 * ### There is no need to make an appointment, just turn up on the day.

Two security marking events are being held in Abbots Langley to help people keep their bicycles more secure.

The free events will take place at the police station on:

 * Friday, September 28, between 11am and 2pm
 * Tuesday, October 23, between 11am and 2pm

PCSO Paul Cook said: "Every year police recover a vast number of bikes but have no way of telling who they belong to in order to return them. Marking your bike in this way will make it less attractive to thieves as it will be harder to sell on. And, if your bike is ever lost or stolen and subsequently recovered, we can return it to you more easily."
