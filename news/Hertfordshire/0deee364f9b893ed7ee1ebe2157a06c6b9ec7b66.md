Representatives from the county's emergency services will come together for a festive open day in Harpenden next month.

The event, which is taking place on Sunday 24 November, is being organised by the cadets in conjunction with Harpenden Town Council, and is in partnership with the Harpenden Christmas Carnival.

Plenty of organisations will be present on the day, including ambulance services and emergency responders, blood bikes and officers from the local Safer Neighbourhood Team and Road Policing Unit.

Visitors of all ages are welcome, and will be able to watch safety demonstrations, receive crime prevention advice on a range of topics and look inside emergency service vehicles. A raffle will be held, and a variety of food and drink will be on offer.

The event takes place at Harpenden Fire Station, Leyton Road, between 1pm and 5pm.
