Police have released CCTV images of a man they would like to trace following a burglary in Buntingford.

At around 5pm yesterday (Friday February 23), a grey BMW has pulled up in front of an address in Olvega Drive before being driven off.

Shortly afterwards, three men have broken in to the home taking items from inside.

Detective Constable Dieter Sweeting said: "We would like to identify the man pictured here. He may have information that can assist us with our enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact the East Herts Local Crime Unit via the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference A5/18/129, or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/report.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
