Between 6.26pm and 6.28pm on Monday, January 7, a man was seen loitering around the drinks section of the Oaklands Post Office in Great North Road before going behind the till area and demanding money while holding a knife.

The victim managed to frighten the offender before the man ran up Canonsfield Road.

Nothing was stolen.

The offender is described as around 5ft 6ins tall, and was wearing a black mask, grey hooded top, dark trousers and black trainers which had white soles.
