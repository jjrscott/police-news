A man has been arrested on suspicion of arson following an incident in Croxley Green in the early hours of this morning (Sunday).

Police were called to the Co-op in New Road at 5.06am to reports that a silver Vauxhall Zafira had collided with the store. There was a small fire at the rear of the vehicle, which was extinguished by the fire service. No-one was injured during the incident. (Crime reference C2/17/3783)

A 34 year old man, of no fixed address, was arrested by officers shortly afterwards on suspicion of arson.

He remains in police custody at this time.

This is being treated as an isolated incident and is not currently being linked to an earlier arson incident, which occurred at the Co-op store at around 2.30am on Friday, December 8 when an accelerant was used to set the shop front alight. (Crime reference C2/17/3764).
