Police are releasing CCTV images of a man they would like to speak to as part of enquiries following a burglary in Carpenders Park.

Between 9.30pm and 10pm on Saturday, October 20, offender(s) gained entry to a home in Compton Place by forcing open a rear door. Once inside they carried out an untidy search and stole cash and jewellery.

Detective Constable Paul Burton said: "We are keen to speak to the man pictured as we believe he may have information that could assist us with our investigation.

"Anyone who recognises him can contact me by emailing or report information via the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/48363/18 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report."
