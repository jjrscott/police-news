Police are asking antique collectors to look out for a 9ct gold pocket watch ornament dating from the 19th century which was stolen from a house in Letchworth Garden City.

The 120-year-old family heirloom, which measures 2 inches across and is inscribed, has a red-eyed buffalo on it and was taken from the home of the 88-year-old grandson of the man it was originally presented to in 1899.

Made by JD Clerkenwell, it bears Hallmark 375 and the inscription reads: "THIS TOKEN OF MERIT AND HONOR OF KNIGHTHOOD WAS PRESENTED TO PRIMO WILLIAM SAVILLE BY THE MEMBERS OF THE PHILANTHROPIC LODGE NO GLE 349 AS A MARK OF RESPECT FOR HIS SERVICES IN THE CAUSE OF BUFFALOISM AND THEIR REGARD AND ESTEEM FOR HIM AS A MAN MAY 17 1899".

Burglars broke in to the home in Eastholme Green sometime between 9pm on Saturday, June 1 and 10am on Tuesday, June 4.

Detective Constable Lea Parker, who is investigating, said: "This gold plaque presented to the victim's grandfather in 1899, is obviously of considerable sentimental value. I would appeal to anyone with information to get in touch, especially keen antique buyers, who may be offered this family heirloom for sale."
