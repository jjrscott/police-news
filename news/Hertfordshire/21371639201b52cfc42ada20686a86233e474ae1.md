Officers are appealing for the public's help to trace a teenager who is missing.

17 year old Clauvin Lokula was last seen at his home in Hoddesdon on Saturday 8 August.

Clauvin is described as black, of a medium build, around 5ft 6in tall and with short black afro curly hair. He has a scar on three of his fingers.

Clauvin was last seen wearing a white t-shirt, silver Nike shorts, black trainers and carrying a men's bag.

He has links to Hertford and South London.

Officers are growing increasingly concerned for Clauvin's welfare.

If you have seen Clauvin since he was reported missing, or have information on his whereabouts, please call the non-emergency number 101. For immediate sightings, call 999 straight away.
