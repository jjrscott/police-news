Police are releasing images of two men they would like to identify as part of their enquiries following a theft in Watford.

At around 7pm on January 30, two offenders entered the B&Q store in Lower High Street and stole a number of power tools that were on display.

Officers would like to speak to the men pictured as they believe they were in the area around the time of the offence and may have information that can assist the investigation.

Anyone who recognises them is asked to contact PC Josh Wilson by emailing, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/10720/19 or report information online.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form.
