A man aged in his 70s who collapsed and went into cardiac arrest in Harpenden yesterday (Wednesday October 18) was helped by members of the public and police officers until an ambulance crew arrived.

Passers-by rushed to help the man using a public defibrillator to carry out CPR at 1.45pm outside the Co-op in Piggotshill Lane.

Sergeant John Anderson praised the people who helped: "The ambulance crew said that without doubt, the members of the public who intervened and three intervention officers who took over, helped save the man's life until paramedics arrived and took the man to hospital. I'd like to thank everyone for their efforts."

The man is in hospital in a critical condition.
