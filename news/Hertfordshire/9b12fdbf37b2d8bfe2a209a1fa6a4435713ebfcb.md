The Make Your Difference police careers discovery events, which started earlier this week with the topic of 'women in policing', continue tomorrow (Thursday 21 January) from 12noon, with a session for people from Black, Asian and ethnic minority backgrounds interested in a policing career.

Future discovery events aimed at under-represented groups include next Tuesday 26 January - neurodiversity and disability; Thursday 28 January - religion and belief; and Tuesday 2 February - LGBTQ+.
