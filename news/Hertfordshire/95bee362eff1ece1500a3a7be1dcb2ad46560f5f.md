Hertfordshire Constabulary are currently refreshing the use of mobile fingerprint scanners on the streets.

These scanners enable us to definitively identify an individual and compare against the Police National Computer which means we can fast-track any associated criminal investigation and assess risk more effectively.

This will help us in situations where we need to identify individuals that are suspected of offences, where the individual may have fallen ill or suffered a serious injury - this system will ONLY be used where officers have the power to do so, rather than speculatively.

The system will increase police officer visibility on the streets and streamline criminal justice processes, making better use of resources.

We would be keen to understand your views whilst we consult over this project. Please leave us your feedback via our online survey.
