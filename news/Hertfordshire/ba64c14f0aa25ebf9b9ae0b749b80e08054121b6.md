Officers from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit are appealing for witnesses following a road traffic collision yesterday (Wednesday, November 28).

At around 4.20pm a white Citroen C3 was in collision with a pedestrian in Nightingale Road, near to the Molly Malones Public House.

The pedestrian - a man in his 70s - has been taken to Lister Hospital and is in a critical condition.

The driver of the car was uninjured.

Nightingale Road was closed until around 8.30pm as the collision was investigated.

Sergeant Sam Cordingley from the Road Policing Unit said: "We are continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident and I would ask anyone who witnessed the collision, or the events prior to it, to contact us.

"Additionally, if anyone was driving in the area around the time of the collision and has a dash cam I would ask them to come forward and speak with us."

Anyone who witnessed the collision, or has any other information in connection with the incident, is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference ISR 501 of November 28.
