Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a man from Hertford who is wanted.

 John Koukoullis, aged 49, is wanted after failing to attend court on 10 February 2020 in connection with fraud offences. He has links to the North and East Hertfordshire.

 Following extensive enquiries by officers to locate the individual, an appeal is being made to the public to help locate this person.

You can report information on his whereabouts online at herts.police.uk/report, speak to an operator in our Force Communications Room via our online web chat at herts.police.uk/contact or call the non-emergency number 101 .

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at crimestoppers-uk.org. If you have seen him in the last few moments, please call 999.
