* ### Do you know who this man is seen near an insecure vehicle in Harpenden?

 * ### Victims of crime are not properly locking their cars.

 * ### Make sure your car is **locked** after you push the lock button on your key ring and that you haven't left anything, especially valuables on display.

Police have released an image of a man caught on camera in Harpenden and are asking for the public's help in identifying him.

It relates to a theft from a motor vehicle at 3.30pm on Wednesday April 18 in Luton Road in Harpenden.

St Albans Neighbourhood Inspector Jon Roche said: "Conservatively, around 80 per cent of thefts from motor vehicle in the St Albans district as a whole are reported to the police by victims who say they do not know how access was gained to their car. It is highly likely that these victims of crime are not properly locking their cars. Please take a moment to make sure your car is **locked** after you push the lock button on your key ring and that you haven't left anything, especially valuables on display. As we increase our scrutiny of vehicle crime we are coming across more and more evidence showing the vast majority of vehicle crimes like this are opportunist and therefore easily **preventable** by simply locking the door. We have CCTV images that clearly show offenders trying doors. If they are locked, they move on to one that isn't. Make sure it is not yours."

Anyone with information which may assist police with their investigation is asked to call 101 and quote crime reference F2/18/855.

Alternatively, contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court.

Gary Jakeman was sentenced to 13 weeks' imprisonment last month for attempting to break in to some cars in Cottonmill Lane. He was caught on a web-based camera where he is clearly seen trying several car doors to see if they were insecure in March this year.
