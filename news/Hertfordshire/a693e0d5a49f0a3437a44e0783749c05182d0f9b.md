The family of a man from North Herts who went missing over a week ago have appealed to the public for information that might help trace him.

William or Bill Taylor, aged 69, was last seen at his home in Gosmore at around 9pm on Sunday (June 3). It was his 70th birthday on Monday (June 11).

His son Richard Taylor made the following appeal:

"If anyone out there knows anything about my dad's whereabouts please contact the police. This is an unbearable situation and I am worried sick about him. My family is in turmoil and we are desperate to get him home."

William is described as being white, around 5ft 11in tall, of medium build with short grey hair. He was last seen wearing a baby blue shirt, jeans and black wellies. William may be wearing a navy blue boiler suit.

Officers are growing increasingly concerned for William's welfare.

If you have seen him since he went missing or have information about his whereabouts please contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101. If you believe you are with William or have seen him in the last few moments please call 999.
