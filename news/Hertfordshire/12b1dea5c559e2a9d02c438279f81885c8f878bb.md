Police are releasing CCTV images of two men they would like to speak to as part of their enquiries following an incident of shoplifting at the Hatfield Galleria.

At around midday on Tuesday, August 7, offenders entered the 02 Store in Comet Way and stole 10 mobile phones from the display.

Officers believe the people pictured may have information that can assist the on-going investigation.

Anyone who recognises them is asked to contact PC Sarah Lingard by emailing, calling the non-emergency number 101 quoting crime reference 41/25133/18 or report information online.

Alternatively, contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
