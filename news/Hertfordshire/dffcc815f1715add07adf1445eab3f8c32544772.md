### * The X2 has been introduced in Hertfordshire this week.

### * The move is part of a national roll-out over the coming months.

### * The introduction of the X2 represents a natural evolution of equipment.

This week has seen the implementation of a new Taser device across Hertfordshire.

As part of a national roll-out over the coming months, Hertfordshire Constabulary will begin using the X2 as a replacement for the current X26 devices, which are no longer in production.

Chief Superintendent Owen Weatherill said: "As with many items used in everyday life, regular upgrades are required to ensure that the equipment remains in good working order; the introduction of the X2 represents a natural evolution of equipment which has now been in use in the UK since 2003.

"Taser officers have undergone additional training and will be carrying the new devices from this week."

Taser is a nationally accredited device available to officers across the UK who have to bring a violent suspect under control, in order to protect themselves, the subject and members of the public.
