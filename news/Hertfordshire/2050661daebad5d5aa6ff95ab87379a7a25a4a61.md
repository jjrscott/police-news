Motorcyclists are being invited to an engagement event being held at Baldock Services (A1M Junction 10) on Sunday 12th May.

Officers will be at the location between 10am and 4pm to chat to bikers and to promote the upcoming Biker Down and Bikesafe events.

Biker Down teaches motorcyclists how to deal with someone who has come off their bike so as not to cause further injury.

The Bike Safe events cover attitude to risk, bend assessment, overtaking, and hazard management, as well as an observed ride with an advanced qualified police motorcyclist. You can find out more or sign up for Bike Safe here.

PC Mark Fairclough from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit said: "Riding motorcycles should be fun and safe. This event is a chance for us to positively engage with bikers around safer riding.

"Previous similar events we have held were well supported and I would encourage anyone in the area on Sunday to come and see us."
