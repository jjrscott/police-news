One man and two women have been arrested in connection with theft in St Albans.

The incident is alleged to have happened at the Card Factory at around 4pm on Tuesday October 16, when the victim, a woman aged in her 80's, had her purse stolen from her handbag while near the store's checkouts.

Inspector Jon Roche said: "We are working hard to target thieves who travel into our city and prey on vulnerable shoppers. Officers are carrying out covert and overt patrols to identify suspects and make arrests.

"There is some simple crime prevention advice that you can follow to help reduce the chances of becoming a victim. Please keep your bag on you at all times, keep it securely closed and where possible use a bag that can be zipped shut. Be aware of people distracting you or brushing past you and report any suspicious activity to police via 101. If a crime is in progress always dial 999.

"If you'd prefer to provide information anonymously call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or report information online at www.crimestoppers-uk.org."

 * A 21 year old woman, a 25 year old woman and a 36 year old man, all from Edmonton, London, were arrested on suspicion of theft. They have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
