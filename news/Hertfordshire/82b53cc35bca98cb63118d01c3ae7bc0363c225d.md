Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a man from Hemel Hempstead who is wanted.

Martin Horsefall, aged 32, from Masons Road, is wanted in connection with a shoplifting offence and on recall to prison.

Anyone who sees Martin, or knows of his whereabouts, is asked to contact police on the non-emergency number 101.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
