31/01/2021 18:20 There is currently a large police presence in the Comet Way/Galleria area of Hatfield following reports of a large group of people congregating and behaving in an anti-social manner, including throwing eggs at cars.

We would like to reassure you that seven people have been arrested so far and a Section 35 dispersal order has been put in place.

Inspector Kio Bozorgi said: "This is incredibly reckless behaviour given the current climate and we will be taking robust action against those who have chosen to selfishly disregard the COVID-19 guidance. The instructions could not be any clearer - stay at home to save lives and protect the NHS.

"A number of those arrested are under 18 and so I would like to take this opportunity to remind parents to ensure their children are following the rules."
