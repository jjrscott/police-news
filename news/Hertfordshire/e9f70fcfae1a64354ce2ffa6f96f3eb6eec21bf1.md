Police are advising residents to ensure their sheds and outbuildings are secure following a series of shed burglaries in Wormley.

Two sheds on an allotment in Church Lane were broken into overnight between Friday, April 6 and Saturday, April 7.

A Dewalt drill was taken from one of the sheds (crime reference K1/18/867) but nothing was taken from the second (K1/18/866).

On the same evening, offenders broke the padlock to gain access to a shed in Pembroke Close. Items were moved inside but nothing was taken (K1/18/864).

Detective Sergeant Thomas Hardy, from the Local Crime Unit, said: "I am appealing for anyone who may have witnessed any suspicious activity around these locations to please get in contact with us."

Anyone with information about the break-ins is asked to contact Broxbourne Local Crime Unit on the non-emergency number 101, quoting the relevant crime number given above. You can also report information online

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.

The Constabulary has recently launched its annual spring crime prevention campaign, Operation Gnome, to help residents take steps to keep their gardens, sheds and allotments secure.

This is the time of year when people are buying new gardening tools and leisure equipment, which often end up stored in gardens or outbuildings. Burglars tend to target sheds, garages and outbuildings, during the spring looking, for new power tools, bikes and other expensive items.

DS Hardy continued: "We generally see an increase in thefts from gardens, sheds and garages, at this time of year so we are recommending that everyone takes some basic security measures to make their property secure. Always lock your shed, preferably with two 'hasp and staple' locks, or use an alarmed padlock. You should also ensure that boundary fences are secure and spikey plants are good additional deterrents. Further advice is available on our website."
