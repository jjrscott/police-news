* ### Tool marking event in Hoddesdon on Saturday, October 14 at John Warner Leisure Centre.

 * ### Event runs from 10am until 3pm.

 * ### Follows several thefts from vans in the area.

The Hoddesdon Safer Neighbourhood Team is running a tool marking event following several thefts from vans in the area.

Safer Neighbourhood Inspector for Broxbourne Roy Stammers said: "Tools worth thousands of pounds have been stolen from vans across the borough in recent months, which will have had a huge impact on the owners and their livelihoods.

"One of my team, PCSO Chris Hart, will be at the John Warner Leisure Centre on Saturday October 14, between 10am and 3pm, fully equipped with his engraver, so please come down with your tools and let Chris engrave them. Engraving deters the theft of your tools and helps aid their recovery if lost or stolen.

"I would like to remind people to remove tools from their van overnight, if possible, or if not to fit a tool safe and ensure it is secured with good quality locks. Fit additional external locks to van doors and consider parking your van close to a hedge or wall in order to restrict access for anyone trying to get into your vehicle."

Officers investigating the thefts are appealing for information and witnesses after vans were broken into and tools taken in the following areas:

 * A Citroen van was broken into in the Lampits and power tools taken between 7.30pm on Tuesday October 10 and 7.30am on Wednesday October 11.
 * A Ford van was broken into in Stanstead Drive, between 6.30pm on Tuesday October 10 and 5am on Wednesday October 11, but nothing was taken.
 * A Toyota van was broken into in Hawthorn Road and power tools were stolen between 7pm on Tuesday October 10 and 8.30am Wednesday October 11.
