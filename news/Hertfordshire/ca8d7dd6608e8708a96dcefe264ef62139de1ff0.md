* Dangerous driver jailed for 2 and a half years
 * He was also banned from driving for four years, three months

A man has been jailed for two and a half years after admitting causing death by dangerous driving on the A10 near Reed.

Mohammad Ahmed, 36, of Upland Road, Thornwood, Epping, was sentenced at St Albans Crown Court on Friday 4 October. He was also disqualified from driving for four years and three months. He had pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving at a previous hearing.

Ahmed was driving a silver 320 BMW which collided with a Volkswagen Move Up on the A10 northbound carriageway, at the junction for Reed, on the morning of Sunday 14 July. Rear seat passenger of the Volkswagen, Catherine Roberts, 77, of Links Side, Enfield, sustained fatal injuries. The driver, Kenneth Roberts, 80, was seriously injured and treated at Addenbrooke's Hospital.

PC Neil Crosier, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit, said: "Ahmed's dangerous driving on this morning cost the life of a much-loved lady and left her husband badly injured. Our thoughts remain with Catherine's family at what continues to be a difficult time."
