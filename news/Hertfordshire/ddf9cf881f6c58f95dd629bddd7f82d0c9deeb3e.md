* ### Hertfordshire police have released it's latest call figures.

 * ### Online reporting has gone by 19%.

 * ### Here are all the ways you can contact us.

As Hertfordshire Constabulary releases figures showing that online reporting has gone up by 19% in the last year, the force is reminding the public of the many ways to make contact.

From June 2018 to May 2019, police received 527,782 calls into the Force Communications Room (FCR) and, of these, 170,343 calls came via the 999 emergency number.

Call handlers answered 14,649 hoax calls - that's 2.8 per cent of the total number of calls.

Our average 999 call lasted three minutes and 55 seconds, while the average 101 non-emergency call lasted five minutes and 35 seconds.

However, picking up the phone is not the only way to get in touch with police in Hertfordshire.

Superintendent Ken Townsend who oversees public contact, said: "In the past year we've seen that increasing numbers of people choosing to log on rather than pick up the phone when getting in touch about a non-emergency matter, which is great to see.

"During this period, 10,170 crimes were reported online through our website and we had 23,000 live web chats with members of the public. We're expecting these figures to continue to rise as more and more people embrace modern technology to contact us. We have also experienced a dramatic increase in the reporting on line of Business Crime.

"The service you receive online is the same as the response you get when dialling 101, with the same police staff in our FCR dealing with your report or enquiry.

"Through our website you can report a crime, a road traffic collision, anti-social driving and other matters. You can also speak to a call handler directly through our online web chat facility.

"The online reporting options should only be used in non-emergency situations. If there is a risk to life or property please always dial 999 so that we can get help to you as quickly as possible."

Police and Crime Commissioner David Lloyd said: "I am pleased to see an increase in the numbers of the members of the public using these new internet based systems to contact the police. It has become the norm for people in so many areas of life to communicate electronically, it is often easier, more convenient and quicker for them.

 "I have also ensured that people who still want to contact police by traditional means by phone or person are still able to do so. We have operational police stations in every part of the county to serve their local area, where residents can see an officer by appointment."

**101 or 999 - which one should you call?**

Calling 999 means your call gets priority and allows the most appropriate action to be taken immediately.

Always call 999 if:

 * Someone is injured, being threatened or is in danger.
 * There is a risk of injury to someone or a risk of serious damage to property.
 * A crime is in progress or you suspect a crime is in progress.
 * There is a serious incident which needs immediate police attendance.
 * Someone suspected of a crime is nearby.

The 101 number should be used for non-emergencies. Typical examples of when people should call 101 include:

 * If you want to give police information about a crime that is not currently in progress.
 * To contact a local police officer, such as someone from your Safer Neighbourhood team.
 * If your property has been stolen or damaged but it is not a crime in progress.
 * If you suspect drug dealing or use in your area.

If you are deaf, hard of hearing or speech impaired you can also text **07786 207091 (this number is only used in Hertfordshire)** or textphone/Minicom **18001 101** **.** In an emergency text your emergency to 999 (you must be registered to the National Emergency Text Service before doing this) including what the problem is, what service you require - police, fire, ambulance or coastguard and give the details of where you are.
