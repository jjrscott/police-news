We can now confirm that bomb threats made to seven schools in Hertfordshire are being treated as hoaxes.

Enquiries are continuing and we are working with other police forces across the country, who have schools in their areas that have also received threats, to investigate who is responsible.

We take hoaxes extremely seriously. They divert police resources and cause disruption and alarm to the public.

Anyone with information that may assist the investigation is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101, quoting ISR 172 of March 19 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/report.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
