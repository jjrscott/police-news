A free tool marking event is being held in Tring on Saturday, February 23.

Officers will be marking tools at the police station (access via Akeman Street) from 11am to 2pm.

Tring PCSO Jake Smith said: "Engraving or marking your tools makes them less attractive to thieves as they are then harder to sell on. It also makes it easier to return items to the rightful owners if they are ever lost or stolen and later recovered by police."

Motorists will also be able to get tamper-proof number plate screws fitted (provided the vehicle's number plates are already secured by screws) and receive crime prevention advice.

If you would like to come along please confirm your attendance on the Dacorum Facebook page event entitled 'Crime Prevention Event - Tool Engraving/Number Plate Screws'. If you don't have access to Facebook just come along on the day.

If you are unable to attend but would like to arrange for your tools to be engraved or you have a large amount of tools that need engraving please email the Tring Safer Neighbourhood Team at RSNTBerkhamstedandTring@herts.pnn.police.uk so that an alternative date and time can be arranged.

There will be a limited amount of parking available at the police station.
