The first Safer Streets event was held in Tring on Saturday (February 16).

Officers from the town's Safer Neighbourhood Team were joined by the local Neighbourhood Watch liaison officer and representatives from Hertfordshire Fire Service, and Dacorum Borough Council.

More than 400 homes in Roseberry Way, Kingsley Walk and Eight Acres were visited and 86 households signed up to OWL (Online Watch Link) - the Constabulary's free online messaging service that sends email alerts about local crimes.

Berkhamsted and Tring Sergeant Ryan Hemmings said: "This was a great opportunity for officers and representatives from our partners to meet with local residents and discuss any issues they may be experiencing.

"I'm pleased that a number of households took the opportunity to sign up to OWL, which is an invaluable tool for keeping residents up to date about local crimes and the latest crime prevention advice.

 "You can find out more about OWL and sign up at www.owl.co.uk/herts.

 "We'll be hosting similar events in Berkhamsted and Hemel Hempstead in the coming months."
