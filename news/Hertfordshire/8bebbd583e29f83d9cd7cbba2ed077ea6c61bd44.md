* ### Two arrested in dawn drugs raids

 * ### Addresses across Borehamwood were raided

 * ### The warrants were done as part of Operation Relentless

Two people were arrested during early morning raids at several addresses in Borehamwood on Wednesday 13 November.

The warrants were served as part of Hertfordshire Constabulary's Operation Relentless, targeting organised crime groups in the county. During the 5am operation addresses in Gregson Way, Maxwell Road, Warenford Way and Stratfield Road were searched by officers from Hertfordshire Constabulary's Serious and Organised Crime Group, in partnership with local policing teams.

A 28 year old man and a 28 year old woman, both from Borehamwood, were arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs. Both were released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Detective Chief Inspector Tracy Pemberton from Hertfordshire Constabulary's Serious and Organised Crime Unit said: "These warrants were carried out as part of our continuing Operation Relentless work, Hertfordshire Constabulary's response to the threat from organised criminal gangs. These groups pose a threat to local communities and the force is committed to identifying and relentlessly pursuing individuals and networks involved in serious and organised crime. As part of this work, we depend on information from members of the community to help us crack down on drug-related crime. Any information you can provide, no matter how small it may seem, could help us to identify and apprehend drug dealers."
