Officers in East Herts are appealing for help to trace two men they believe could assist them with their inquiries into a commercial burglary in Sawbridgeworth.

Overnight on Sunday April 8, one of the units in Riverside Business Park was broken into and power tools and plant equipment stolen.

Officers would like to speak to the men in the photo as they believe they were in the area at the time and could have information which could help the enquiry.

If you recognise these men or have any other information which could help the investigation please contact PC Shelly Marshall on 101 or online quoting crime reference number A4/18/236.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
