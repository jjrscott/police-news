Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a man who is wanted.

Matthew Finn, aged 28, whose last known address is Cuckmere Lane, Southampton, is wanted in connection with kidnap.

He has links to Hertfordshire, North London, Newbury in Berkshire, Basingstoke and Southampton in Hampshire.

Anyone who sees him should not approach him and should instead contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via 999 immediately.
