A 50-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday (February 28) at his home address in London in connection with a number of burglaries across the St Albans District between November 1, 2017 and January 20, 2018.

Dixie Palache, of Pamla Street in London, has been charged with conspiracy to burgle between those dates.

He was remanded in custody by Hatfield Remand Court yesterday (Thursday March 1) and will be appearing at St Albans Crown Court on March 28, 2018.

Detective Inspector Alex Warwick said: "Thank you to the public for reporting suspicious incidents and sending us your CCTV images which has assisted us greatly in tackling burglaries across the district. Please continue to call us on 101 - or 999 if you suspect a crime is in progress or you suspect someone's life is in danger."

The arrest was part of the Constabulary's month of action to track down wanted suspects.
