Officers investigating an incident of racial abuse in Welwyn Garden City are appealing for two victims to come forward.

It happened outside Co-op on Cole Green Lane between 10.10am and 10.15am on Saturday, January 13.

A member of the public called the control room after witnessing an incident involving a group of teenagers outside the store.

It was reported that two men who walked past the larger group were subjected to racial abuse. They did not react and instead left the area.

Following the call, officers attended the scene but the two men who had been the victims of the abuse could not be found.

PCSO Luke Smith, who is investigating, said: "We are keen to trace the two men and speak to them about what happened and progress the investigation. Was this you? Or did your friend or family member talk to you about something similar that happened to them? If so, please call 101 quoting crime reference B1/18/187, or report information online.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
