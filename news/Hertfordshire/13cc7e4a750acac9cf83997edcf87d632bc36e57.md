Police have recovered a suspected stolen bicycle and would like to reunite it with its owner.

The white mens' Decathlon mountain bike was seized after police detained a man at the railway station in Ware on Wednesday, April 25.

PC Nicholas Anstead, who is investigating, said: "We have reason to believe the bike had been stolen earlier in the day on the 25th but we have not had any reports of stolen bikes matching its description.

"Therefore we would like to reunite this bike with its rightful owner so if you recognise it, or believe it belongs to you, please call us on 101 quoting crime reference A1/18/1344."
