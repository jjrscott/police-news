The North Stevenage Safer Neighbourhood Team are hosting a series of 'Street Meets' in their area to give residents a chance to come and discuss issues with officers face to face.

Local officers and PCSOs will be visiting:

**Jessop Road**

**Mildmay Road**

**Wisden Road**

**Trumper Road**

**Chester Road**

On the following dates:

**Wednesday 28 March at 2pm for Jessop Road and Mildmay Road only**

**Saturday April 7 at 11am**

**Friday April 13 at 5pm**

Residents will be offered crime prevention and personal safety advice as well as the chance to discuss any issues or answer any questions they might have.

Stevenage North Neighbourhood Sergeant Martin May said: "We are aware that many of the residents in these areas have had issues with anti-social behaviour and drug related crime. It is really important that they stay in contact with us and are able to discuss any issues or questions they have with their local officers in an informal environment. We look forward to seeing you soon!"
