Police are appealing for information and witnesses following an assault in Stevenage.

Shortly after 4pm this afternoon (Saturday, October 6), a man in his twenties sustained stab wounds in a property in Marymead Drive.

The victim has been taken to hospital and the offenders are believed to be five males, who were wearing balaclavas.

Detective Inspector Michael Macbeth, who is investigating, said: "Luckily the man's injuries are not thought to be serious.

"We are conducting extensive enquiries to trace those responsible and I would like to reassure residents that those involved are believed to be known to each other.

"If you saw suspicious activity in the area at the time, or have information about what happened, I would like to hear from you.

"Please get in touch via the Hertfordshire Constabulary non-emergency number 101 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/report quoting ISR 518 of October 6."

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
