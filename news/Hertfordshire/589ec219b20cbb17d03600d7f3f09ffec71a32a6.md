Police are appealing for information and witnesses following an alleged assault in St Albans.

At around 6.40pm on Friday, March 1, it is reported that a 17 year old girl was assaulted by a group of youths believed to be known to her outside Barclays Banks in St Peter's Street.

The victim - a 17 year old girl - suffered a bleed on the brain, a detached eye retina and a suspected fractured eye socket. She has since been discharged from hospital.

Detective Constable Paul Edmondson, who is investigating, said: "We have arrested two people in connection with this incident and our enquiries are currently on-going.

"I'm appealing for anyone who believes they saw what happened to get in touch as you may have information that is vital to our investigation."

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has information is asked to contact DC Edmondson by emailing paul.edmondson@herts.pnn.police.uk, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/20068/19 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, you can stay 100 per cent anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.

 * A 14 year old girl and a 15 year old girl from St Albans have been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. They have been police bailed until March 28 while enquiries continue.
