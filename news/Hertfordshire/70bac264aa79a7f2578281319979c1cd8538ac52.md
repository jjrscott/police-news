"I'd like to encourage members of the public to report any suspected illegal drug activity in their local neighbourhood to police by calling the non-emergency number 101, online or via Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their online form.

"This valuable information is vitally important in helping us to build up and intelligence picture so that we can take action in the fight against drugs."
