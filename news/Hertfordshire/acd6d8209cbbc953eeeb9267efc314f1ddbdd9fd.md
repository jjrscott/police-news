Two men were arrested after being stopped by officers from Broxbourne's Operation Scorpion team.

At around 1pm on Tuesday 13 August, the officers were on patrol in Station Approach, Waltham Cross when they stopped a group of people. Four were searched under the Misuse of Drugs Act.

Following the searches, two people were arrested. A quantity of suspected Class A drugs, cannabis and a knife was found and seized.

An 18-year-old man from Dunstable was arrested on suspicion of possession of Class A drugs with the intent to supply. He has been released under investigation.

Another 18-year-old man - Jayden Collington-Vanirel from Waltham Cross - has been charged with possession of a bladed article. He is due to appear at Stevenage Magistrates' Court on 11 September.

PC Lewis Mack from Operation Scorpion said: "We regularly utilise various different tactics, such as unmarked police cars and plain-clothed officers, in order to proactively find those suspected of committing crime in our community.

"The Operation Scorpion team targets burglars, robbers and those suspected of being involved in drug and vehicle-related crime and we want the public to help us keep Broxbourne a safe place.

"If you suspect someone is involved in criminality please let us know so we can take action. One phone call could be all that it takes to help us protect members of our community from harm."
