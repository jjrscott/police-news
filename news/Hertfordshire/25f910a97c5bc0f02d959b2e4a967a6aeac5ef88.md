* Man jailed after he was caught stealing from garages in Cheshunt
 * Keith Barnes, of Davison Drive, Cheshunt, has been sentenced to 25 weeks in prison
 * A member of the public spotted him acting suspiciously and called police

A 36-year-old man has been handed a prison sentence after pleading guilty to three counts of burglary in Cheshunt.

Keith Barnes, of Davison Drive, Cheshunt, appeared before Hatfield Remand Court on Wednesday, January 3.

He pleaded guilty to two counts of burglary non-dwelling and one count of burglary with intent (non-dwelling) and was sentenced to 25 weeks in prison.

Barnes was caught after an eagle-eyed member of the public spotted him breaking into several garages in a block in the Hillview Gardens/Prescott Road area in the early hours of Tuesday, January 2.

Following their call to the control room, officers immediately attended the scene and Barnes was swiftly arrested before being later charged and remanded.

The items that he stole have now been returned to their rightful owners.

Detective Constable Rebecca Watson, from the Cheshunt Local Crime Unit, said: "I am pleased with this result as I think it sends a strong message to would-be burglars that a custodial sentence is the outcome if they choose to steal from innocent people.

"I would especially like to thank the member of the public who, once they had spotted Barnes and realised what he was doing, called us and then kept an eye on him until officers had arrived.

"This reiterates the fact that the public are our eyes and ears. If you believe a crime is in progress, always call 999."
