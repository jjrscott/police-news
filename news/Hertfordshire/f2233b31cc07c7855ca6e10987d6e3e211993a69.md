Officers are appealing for the public's help to identify four people following a distraction robbery in Welwyn Garden City.

Between 11.30am and 12.30pm on Thursday, August 30, several offenders worked together to steal an elderly woman's bank card and obtained her pin by looking over her shoulder as she paid for goods at Aldi in Bessemer Road. The card was subsequently used to withdraw Â£200.Police believe the four people pictured may have information that can assist the on-going investigation.

Anyone who recognises them or has any information that can help police is asked to contact PCSO Daniel Hill by emailing, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/33431/18, or report information online.

Alternatively, contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
