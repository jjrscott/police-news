Residents in Hoddesdon have the chance to meet and speak with their local Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT) as a series of surgeries are being held in the town.

The events are being held in the Morrisons store in Amwell Street on every Saturday in April between midday and 3pm.

Hoddesdon SNT Sergeant James Lacey said: "This is a great opportunity for members of our community to come and meet their local policing team and speak with them face-to-face.

"I would encourage anyone who has any concerns or questions to pop along to raise these and we will do all we can to help you.

"We will be on hand to offer crime prevention advice and tips, as well as providing some useful freebies that will help keep you and your property safe and secure.

"Please do come along and say hello. We look forward to meeting many of you over the coming weekends."
