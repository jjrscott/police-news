Police investigating a suspected burglary at an address in Sawbridgeworth are re-appealing to the public after receiving new images of a man they would like to speak to.

Between 4pm and 4.15pm on December 14, a man knocked at the front door of an address in Mansfield. When the resident answered the door the offender asked if the victim had a parcel for them.

The resident proceeded to check a parcel she had delivered earlier in the day. The offender entered the house and grabbed the parcel before running away.

Officers would like to speak with the man pictured as he may have information which could assist the investigation.

Investigator Nicola Morris said, "We believe other homes may have been targeted, so if you were also approached by a man in similar circumstances please contact me.

"Anyone with information should contact me at _nicola.morris@herts.pnn.police.uk_ or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/66018/18."
