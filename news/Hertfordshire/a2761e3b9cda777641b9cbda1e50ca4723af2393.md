Officers investigating a serious sexual assault in Potters Bar are appealing for information and witnesses.

Between 9pm and 9.30pm on Bank Holiday Monday (May 28) a man, aged in his 40s, was sexually assaulted by a man in bushes in Mutton Lane parallel to the Tesco petrol station.

Detective Constable James Milbourn from Hertfordshire Constabulary's Sexual Offences Investigation Team (SOIT) said: "I'm appealing for anyone who may have been in the area around the time stated to think back and consider whether they saw anything suspicious or unusual in Mutton Lane.

"Any information you may have, no matter how insignificant it may seem, could be key to our investigation."

Hertsmere Detective Inspector Graeme Walsingham said: "I understand that news of this will cause concern among the local community.

"We're working hard to establish the exact circumstances surrounding this crime and while this is on-going we have increased police patrols in the local area."

Anyone with information is asked to contact DC Milbourn by emailing james.milbourn@herts.pnn.police.uk, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/2225/18 or report information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report.

"Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court."
