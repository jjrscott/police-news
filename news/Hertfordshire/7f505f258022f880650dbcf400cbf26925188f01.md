Police are appealing for information and witnesses following a distraction theft in Buntingford.

At around 11.20am on Friday, October 12, the victim - a man aged in his 80s - had just used the Barclays Bank cash machine in Station Road, Buntingford, when he was approached by several offenders who distracted him by saying he had dropped Â£10 and asked him to check his wallet.

The victim refused and walked off down the road. A short time later he noticed that his bank card had been stolen from his pocket.

His card had already been used by the offenders to withdraw cash.

Police would like to speak to the three people pictured as they may have information that can help with the on-going enquiries.

Anyone who recognises them or has information that could assist the investigation is asked to contact PCSO Aaron Pender by emailing aaron.pender@herts.pnn.police.uk, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/45549/18 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
