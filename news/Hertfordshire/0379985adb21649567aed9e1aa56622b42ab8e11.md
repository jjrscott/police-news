Police are appealing for the public's help to reunite a suspected stolen camera with its rightful owners.

The camera was found in Watford on Sunday 1 September, as part of an ongoing police investigation, and is believed to have been stolen from a vehicle.

PC Abbi Symes, from the Constabulary's Case Investigation Team, said: "The camera holds memories of trips away and places that this couple have visited and I would really like to be able to return it to them.

"We have chosen to blur their faces in order to respect their privacy, but we are hoping someone may still have information which could assist us. If you can help, or if you think the camera may belong to you, please get in touch."

If you think you may have information which could assist, please contact PC Symes via email to abbi.symes@herts.pnn.police.uk.

You can also report information online, speak to an operator in our Force Communications Room via our online web chat or call the non-emergency number 101.
