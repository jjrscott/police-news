* ### Kids can win tickets to Harry Potter, 360 Play or Paradise Wildlife Park

 * ### Advice on how to stay safe at Halloween and Bonfire Night

Halloween and Bonfire Night are fun times of the year for young people and to make it even more special, we're offering opportunities to win some amazing competition prizes.

Hertfordshire Constabulary has teamed up with local partners to give youngsters the chance to win trips to; the Warner Bros Studio Tour - The Making of Harry Potter in Leavesden, 360 Play in Stevenage or Paradise Wildlife Park in Broxbourne.

Over the Halloween and Bonfire Night period, Hertfordshire Constabulary is inviting young people between the ages of 5 and 16 across the county to take part in an online quiz, which aims to help them enjoy Halloween and Bonfire Night safely.

The quiz is part of a campaign run by Hertfordshire Constabulary during the Halloween and Bonfire Night period, working with local councils and the Fire and Rescue Service, to deter anti-social behaviour and make sure everyone has a safe and enjoyable time.

To enter the competition visit our competition page answer the questions before midnight on Monday 6 November.

To help everyone have a safe and enjoyable Halloween Hertfordshire Constabulary is offering the following advice to children (and parents) who are planning to go trick or treating:

__

 * Never go trick or treating alone and always take an adult with you
 * Don't knock on the doors of strangers (look out for signs that trick or treaters are welcome, such as Halloween decorations)
 * Keep your Halloween 'tricks' safe - damage to property or hurting someone is a crime
 * Remember road safety rules, particularly after dark
 * Wear something bright so that drivers can see you.
