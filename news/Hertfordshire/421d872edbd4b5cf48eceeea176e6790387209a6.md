Officers investigating an incident of assault in Welwyn Garden City are appealing for information and witnesses.

It happened in Kirklands between 2.10pm and 2.30pm on Saturday, December 2.

The victim, a five year old boy, was in the company of a parent when he was approached by the offender, a man, who then proceeded to use his hands to shake the boy's head before leaving the scene.

The parent of the victim and the offender are known to each other.

PC Abi Wilkins, from the Welwyn Hatfield Intervention and Response Team, said: "This was an upsetting assault on an innocent child, and while the boy was not injured he was left extremely distressed by the offender's actions.
