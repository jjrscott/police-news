Detectives are now in a position to name a woman who died in Welwyn Garden City at the weekend.

An investigation was launched by the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit (BCH MCU) after police were called to a disturbance at an address in Fordwich Road just before 8pm on Saturday (24 August).

Sixty-four-year-old Marietta Louise Lotz, known as Louise, was found collapsed outside a nearby address in the road having suffered serious head injuries.

Paramedics attended and administered medical treatment but she sadly passed away a short while later.

Detective Chief Inspector Jerome Kent, from the BCH MCU, is leading the investigation.

He said: "Our thoughts remain with Louise's family and friends at what is a very upsetting time for them and we ask that their privacy is respected.

"I understand that news of this incident will be unsettling to the wider community but I would like to confirm that we are treating it as an isolated offence and we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the investigation.

"I also ask residents to refrain from speculating about the circumstances on social media, as this will not only cause distress to the victim's family but could also impact the investigation and associated justice process.

"Lastly, I would like to thank those people who have already assisted us with our enquiries but if you believe you have information that could assist our investigation and have not yet spoken with us, then please get in touch as soon as possible."

The Constabulary has proactively referred this incident to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) for review.

Debby Foxwell, aged 40, of Fordwich Road, Welwyn Garden City, has been charged with murder and aggravated burglary. She appeared before Hatfield Remand Court yesterday (Monday 26 August) where she was remanded into custody to appear before St Albans Crown Court tomorrow (Wednesday 28 August).
