The two victims in this case managed to escape their attacker in Osborne Road, Watford, on Thursday, April 25, after being abducted from two separate locations in London.

Watford Chief Inspector Matt Phillips said: "We are doing everything we can to support the Metropolitan Police Service with the investigation into this crime.

"Our Safer Neighbourhood Team has increased their patrols in the North Watford area as a reassurance measure and I would urge anyone in the community who has concerns or worries following this incident to make contact with us online at www.herts.police.uk or via 101.

"Anyone in Hertfordshire who has been the victim of sexual abuse and/or violence can access free independent support and advice at the county's Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC). You can visit www.hertssarc.org or call 0808 178 4448 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

"If you have any information that you think may be helpful to the investigation, please call the Metropolitan Police on 101 quoting CAD 3041/25Apr. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
