Officers investigating a robbery in Hatfield have released dash cam footage of the offence in progress, as well as still images, in order to identify the two suspects.

It happened in Wellfield Road, Hatfield, at 2.10pm on Monday, June 25.

The victim, an 18-year-old woman, works at Ladbrokes in Birchwood and had left the branch with a large quantity of the store's cash takings in a bag, with the intention of banking it at a Post Office in the town centre.

Just after the junction with Burfield Close she was approached from behind by two men who threatened her before snatching the bag from her shoulder.

A member of the public, who captured the offence on their dash cam as they drove by, stopped and asked the victim if she was okay before taking her back to the Ladbrokes branch in The Common. The victim was left uninjured but shaken by the ordeal.

Detective Constable Andrew Greenman, who is investigating, said: "We are grateful to the member of the public who has shared their footage with us after being in the right place at the right time.

"We are following several lines of enquiry at this stage, one of which is appealing to the public to ask if they recognise the man pictured.

"If you do, please email me on andrew.greenman@herts.pnn.police.uk, report online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report or by calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/11033/18.

"I want to reassure the victim that we are doing all we can to capture those responsible."
