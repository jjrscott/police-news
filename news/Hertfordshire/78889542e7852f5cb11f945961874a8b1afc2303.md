Officers investigating an incident of common assault in Hatfield are releasing a CCTV image of two men they would like to speak to as part of their enquiries.

At around 5.30am on Sunday, June 3, two people were involved in an argument with a man in Woodpecker Close at the rear of the Mercure Hatfield Oak Hotel. One of the offenders threw a plant pot at the victim which missed him but hit his car.

The offenders then made off in a red vehicle, possibly a Corsa.

Officers would like to speak to the men pictured as they may have information that can assist the investigation.
