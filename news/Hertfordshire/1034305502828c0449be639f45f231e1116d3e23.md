Officers investigating a theft and two assaults, which occurred at the Hatfield Galleria, are appealing for the public's help to identify a man who may be able to help police with their enquiries.

At around 6pm on Thursday, August 2, two offenders attempted to steal Â£500 worth of handbags from TK Maxx in Comet Way. As they left the store they were challenged by a member of staff who recovered the items and detained one of the offenders. However, he was hit to the side of the head by the other offender who then ran off.

The offender also pushed over a member of the public - a man aged in his 70s - as he made off causing him to suffer shoulder and elbow injuries.

PC Sarah Lingard, who is investigating, said: "I'm appealing for anyone who recognises the man pictured to get in touch as we believe he may have information that can assist the on-going investigation."
