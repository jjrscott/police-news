* ### Thirteen new Special Constables have been attested.

 * ### They joined family and friends for a ceremony at police headquarters.

 * ### Recruitment for the Special Constabulary is still open.

Thirteen new Special Constables were warmly welcomed into Hertfordshire Constabulary during their Attestation Ceremony at Police Headquarters on Thursday (March 14).

Special Constables have full police powers, uniform and protective equipment and work alongside the regular force.

During eleven weeks of training, the new recruits learnt about basic law around theft, public order, assaults, traffic, powers of arrest and Stop and Search. They also used a virtual learning environment which trained them in legislation.

Each graduate went through a rigorous selection process and had to pass a final exam and practical assessments to enable them to qualify for the role of Special Constable.

Those who graduated are:

**Broxbourne**

 * **Joseph O 'Grady **who volunteers at a charity.

**North Herts**

 * **Luke Balazy who works as an apprentice mechanical and electrical engineer.**

 * Jack Nicol who works as a technical sales engineer.

**St Albans**

 * **Thomas Martin**

**Stevenage**

 * **Hannah Draycott who works for an airline company.**

**Watford**

 * **Christopher Larner who works as a telecoms engineer.**

 * Paul Ferebee who works for a motor company.

 * Jamie Quinn who works at a trampolining company.

**Welwyn Hatfield**

 * **Michael Avery who works as a business analyst for an asset management company.**

 * Robert Pitts who works as a paraplanning manager in the City.

 * Ellis Herbert who works in the Constabulary's Force Communications Room (FCR) as a Communications Operator.

 * Christian Kirk who works for the ambulance service and is studying for his paramedic degree.

 * Samuel Moorby who works part time at an end of life care home.

They were joined on the evening by family, friends and local dignitaries.

Over the next 12 months, the new recruits will continue their training, allowing them to pass out as substantive Special Constables once they are assessed as fit for independent patrol.

**Assistant Chief Constable Nathan Briant awarded the Specials with their certificates. He said:** "It is a great honour to welcome these new Special Constables to the Constabulary. The work they do is vital in helping us to police the county. I want to wish them all well as they now move on to undertake this important role within the communities of Hertfordshire."

**Special Constabulary Chief Officer, Mark Kendrew said:** "I was delighted to meet our new Special Constables and I am very proud to welcome them to our dedicated team. They have been through a rigorous recruitment process and spent a number of weeks completing the intensive training required to fulfil the role of a Special Constable.

"Becoming a Special Constable brings with it the promise of being involved in something exciting, worthwhile and that makes a real difference in the local community as well as having the chance to learn new skills. I have no doubt they will make a significant contribution to policing in Hertfordshire."

**Assistant Police and Crime Commissioner** **for Hertfordshire** **Stuart Nagler** **said:** "I am delighted to welcome our new Specials into what is an expanding police team in Hertfordshire. We're very fortunate to have such a dedicated team of Special Constables, who bring a wealth of skills and life experience to policing. I wish them all the very best as they embark on their first shifts."

A short film has recently been launched to showcase the exciting role of a Special Constable in the hope it will encourage more people to volunteer with Hertfordshire's Special Constabulary. You can view the video on the Herts Police YouTube channel at youtube.com/hertspolice

**Recruitment of Special Constables**

Hertfordshire Constabulary is actively recruiting Special Constables. It is looking for motivated team players wanting a challenge. Special Constables have full police powers, uniform and protective equipment and work alongside the regular force.

Special Constables get involved in all areas of frontline policing - from high visibility patrols around pubs and clubs at the weekend and being called to assist at the scene of a road traffic collision or burglary to arresting offenders or reassuring and advising residents after a crime has occurred. Hertfordshire Constabulary are piloting 'Career Pathways' and have a number of specialist opportunities for officers.

Once initial training is complete, Specials are posted to local response or neighbourhood teams and are coached by regular officers to complete their Police Action Checklists and are then deemed fit for independent patrol. On average this can take around 12 months. Once the officers are fit for independent patrol, they can apply for a posting to one of our specialist teams.

Aside from 'response' or local Safer Neighbourhood policing, there are constantly evolving opportunities to work within specialist policing environments, such as the investigation of modern slavery, human trafficking, cybercrime, domestic abuse, proactive units targeting local drug dealers, wanted persons, night time economy issues and prisoner processing.

Those with an interest or expertise in countryside and rural issues can become Rural Special Constables who are dedicated to the needs of rural communities. They work alongside our Rural Operation Support Team (ROST) and local police Safer Neighbourhood Teams investigating heritage crime or wildlife offences, tackling hare coursing or poaching, to dealing with fly-tipping or crop damage.

 * An information evening will be held at Police Headquarters on Wednesday, March 27 (7pm) for people to find out more about joining the Special Constabulary. If you wish to attend, please email
