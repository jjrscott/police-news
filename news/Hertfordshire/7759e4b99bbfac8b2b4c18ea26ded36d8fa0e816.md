Officers have released a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to in connection with a theft which occurred in Tesco Extra, in Stevenage Town Centre.

Between 12.40pm and 1pm on Saturday (February 10) an envelope containing cash was removed from the handbag of a woman aged in her 70s. The woman had just withdrawn the cash from a bank in the town and it is believed a man followed her from the bank before committing the crime.
