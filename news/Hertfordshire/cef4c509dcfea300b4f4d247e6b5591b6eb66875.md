Drugs, weapons and cash were seized during a series of warrants in Watford.

Officers from Operation Scorpion targeted three addresses in the town on Monday, February 4, with assistance from the Safer Neighbourhood Team.

A quantity of class A drugs, weapons and cash were seized from an address in Beech Road. A 27-year-old man from Watford was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

A quantity of class B drugs and an imitation firearm were recovered at a second address in Beech Road.

Cash was also seized from an address in St Albans Road as part of the operation.

Watford Chief Inspector Matt Phillips said: "These warrants were carried out following intelligence from the public around drug supply and possession of weapons. Drugs can have a big impact on local communities as they often cause more violent and acquisitive crime. If you suspect drug crime in your neighbourhood, please continue to report it to police so we can take appropriate action."
