Officers have recovered a short spear that is believed to have been stolen and are appealing to the public to help reunite the property with the rightful owners.

DC James Simpson said: "This spear, which is similar to an African Massai ceremonial spear, may have been taken from somewhere in Hertfordshire. Thames Valley Police recovered the spear on January 18 from a stolen Audi A3 in the Gerrards Cross area and would like to reunite it with its rightful owners. The Audi was stolen during a burglary in South Drive, Ruislip on January 2.

"If you believe the property pictured may belong to you please get in touch with me by emailing _james.simpson@herts.pnn.police.uk_ , calling the non-emergency number 101 or online at www.herts.police.uk/Report."
