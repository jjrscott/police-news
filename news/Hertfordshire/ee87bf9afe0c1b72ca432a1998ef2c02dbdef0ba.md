We are appealing for witnesses and information following a fail to stop road traffic collision in Hatfield.

At around 10.45am on Sunday 17 January a white BMW 4 Series and a cyclist were in collision on the A1000 junction with Lodge Drive.

The cyclist suffered minor injuries. The BMW made off from the scene.

Detective Constable Rebecca Natali, who is investigating, said: "We have already made a number of enquiries since this incident occurred, but I'd now like to hear from anyone who witnessed what happened, has dash cam footage or further information about it to get in touch.

"If you are able to help I can be contacted directly via email at rebecca.natali@herts.pnn.police.uk"
