Officers have released CCTV images of two men they would like to speak to following a theft in Bishop's Stortford.

On Friday, November 2, the victim - an 82 woman - was buying a poppy outside Sainsbury's in the Thorley Neighbourhood Centre, when a member of the public alerted her to say that her wallet had just been taken from her bag.

Her wallet contained a bank card and this has since been used to withdraw money in three separate transactions.

PCSO Adam Pemberton, from the Bishop's Stortford and Sawbridgeworth Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "The two men pictured are believed to have been in the area at the time of the theft and they might be able to help us with the investigation.

"If you recognise them, or have other information about the theft, please get in touch on the non-emergency number 101, or email me at adam.pemberton@herts.pnn.police.uk quoting crime reference 41/52275/18.

"I would like to reassure residents that patrols are being increased in the area to help tackle purse dippings."
