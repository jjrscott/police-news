Two teenagers were arrested in connection with a series of robberies in the Moor Park area as a result of proactive covert patrols.

On Friday 29 November, a 16 year old boy from Northwood and a 16 year old boy from Watford were arrested on suspicion of robbery.

Their arrests are in connection with eight offences committed near Moor Park railway station between Monday 11 November and Friday 29 November.

The victims range between the ages of 12 and 18 and smartphones, cash and ear phones were among the property stolen.

The teenage boys were arrested by plain-clothes Operation Scorpion officers who were proactively patrolling the area in response to previous reported offences. They had carried out several stop searches of a number of people in the days prior before detaining the two suspects.

Detective Sergeant Steven Boddy, from the Three Rivers Local Crime Unit, said: "The victims of these offences have been left understandably distressed by their ordeals, so we are pleased to have made these arrests which we hope will serve as reassurance to both them and the wider community.

"After we had linked a number of offences together, we were able to target our resources in the form of covert plain-clothes officers. They patrolled the area around the station at the end of the school day, which we had identified as a peak location and time for these incidents, and linked in with nearby schools to offer reassurance.

"We will now carry out further enquiries and will be keeping the victims and their families updated as we progress with our investigation."

Both boys have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
