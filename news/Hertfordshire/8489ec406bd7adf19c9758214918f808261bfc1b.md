Officers are releasing an image of a man they would like to speak to as part of their enquiries following an incident of fraud in Hatfield town centre.

Between 12.30pm and 1.40pm on Saturday, October 13, a couple were outside Poundland when they were approached by a man who offered them several Apple products for sale.

They were a MacBook Air, an iPhone XS, an iPhone 8 Plus and an iPad. The man showed the couple the items, which were in his car within the Poundland car park.

The couple then went away to a cash machine to withdraw money before returning and giving the man Â£300\. He gave them a laptop bag, which the couple believed contained the Apple products. They left and during their journey home realised the laptop bag contained two bottles of water and nothing else.

PC Laura Frelford, who is investigating, said: "I'd like to speak to the man pictured as he may be able to help us with our enquiries into this crime.
