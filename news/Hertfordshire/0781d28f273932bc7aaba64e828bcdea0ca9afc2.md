The assault occurred in an alleyway between Wolsey Road and Maynard Road at 2pm on Saturday, December 15.

The victim, a woman aged in her 50s, was walking in the direction of the hospital when she was approached by the offender, who attempted to engage her in conversation.

She carried on walking but the offender then touched the victim inappropriately.

The victim went into the hospital and the offender followed, but left when she began speaking to someone.

Detective Constable Katherine Stevens, from the Dacorum Local Crime Unit, said: "We are keen to identify the person pictured as we believe he was in the area at the time of the offence and may have information that can help our enquiries.

"If you recognise him, or have any other information that could assist our investigation, please get in touch as soon as possible."

Anyone with information is asked to email DC Stevens at katherine.stevens@herts.pnn.police.uk, call the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/56519/18, or report information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report.
