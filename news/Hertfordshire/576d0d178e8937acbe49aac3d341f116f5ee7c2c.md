Officers investigating several thefts from motor vehicles in Hitchin have released images of a person they would like to speak to as part of their enquiries.

The incidents happened in Gibson Close in the early hours of Tuesday, October 30.

Offender(s) approached the vehicles and gained access by means unknown, opening glove boxes and stealing coins from the coin compartment.

PCSO Stuart Stone, from the Hitchin Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "I appreciate the images aren't the best quality but if you recognise the person pictured then we would like to speak to you. We believe the person may have been in the area around the time of the offence and may have information that could help progress our investigation."

Any witnesses or anyone with information should contact PCSO Stone by emailing, calling the non-emergency number 101 or reporting information online, quoting crime reference 41/51495/18.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
