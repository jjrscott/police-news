Officers are appealing for the public's help to trace a teenage girl who has gone missing from Hemel Hempstead.

She is described as being white, around 5ft tall, of slim build with long straight blonde hair. Mackensie was last seen wearing a pink top, jeans and white Nike trainers.

Police are growing increasingly concerned for Mackensie's welfare. If you have seen her or have information about her whereabouts please contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101. If you believe you are with Mackensie now or have seen her in the last few moments please call 999.
