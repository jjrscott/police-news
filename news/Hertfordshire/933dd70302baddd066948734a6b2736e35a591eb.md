Officers are appealing for information and witnesses following a fatal collision in Nettleden on Saturday, October 6.

The incident happened at around 9.15am in Nettleden Road.

For reasons unknown at this stage, a black Vauxhall Zafira, left the road and collided with a tree stump.

The driver, a man in his thirties, sadly died as a result of the collision.

Sergeant Keith Evans from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit, said: "Our thoughts are with the man's family who are being supported by specially trained officers.

"I would like to hear from anyone who saw the collision, including the events leading up to it, and anyone who has other information that can help with the investigation.

"Similarly, if you have dash cam footage you think may be useful, I would like you to get in touch. If you can help please contact me on the non-emergency number 101 or through email at _Keith.Evans@herts.pnn.police.uk_ , quoting ISR 245 of October 6."
