Detectives in Stevenage have released a selection of images of people they would like to speak to in connection with a series of burglaries at businesses in the town.

Since the middle of February a number of commercial premises have been targeted across Stevenage.

Officers believe the people in the photographs could have information which will help their investigations and are keen to speak to them as soon as possible.

Investigating officer DC Kirsty Richardson said: "We appreciate that the quality of the images is not very clear, but we are hoping that people may recognise the clothing, which could help identify these people."

If you recognise any of these people or have any information which may help please contact DC Kirsty Richardson via email.
