Police are appealing for information and witnesses following a fail to stop collision in Hitchin.

At around 6am today (Friday, November 2) in Old Hale Way, a cyclist was riding along the footpath when a car mounted the pavement and collided with him. The motorist failed to stop at the scene.

The cyclist - a man aged in his 30s - suffered a fractured jaw and is receiving treatment in hospital.

PC David Charlton from the Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire Road Policing Unit said: "We are still working to establish the exact location of the collision in this road and further details about the car and motorist involved.

"As part of our enquiries I'm appealing for anyone who was in the area around the time stated and believes they saw or heard anything that could help our investigation to get in touch as soon as possible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact PC Charlton by calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting ISR 95 of November 2, or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
