Officers investigating an incident of theft in Bishop's Stortford are releasing pictures of a person they would like to speak to as part of their enquiries.

Between 4.10pm and 4.20pm on Monday, October 22, an offender entered jewellery store Finery & Co in Bridge Street. He picked out a few items from the catalogue and asked to take photos of them to show his mother.

A staff member placed a gold chain bracelet on the display counter for the man to see. The offender grabbed the bracelet and ran out of the shop without paying for it.

Police would like to speak to the man pictured as they may have information about the theft that could prove useful to the investigation.

Anyone who recognises him or has any other information that could assist the investigation, is asked to contact PC Adam Pemberton by emailing, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/48988/18 or report information online.

Alternatively, contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court.
