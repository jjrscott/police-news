Officers investigating the fatal collision involving a bus and a pedestrian in Rickmansworth are re-appealing for the remaining witnesses to come forward.

The collision happened on the High Street, at the junction with Station Road, just before 2.30pm on Saturday, June 15 and involved a woman in her 60s, who sadly died.

Investigating Officer PC Felicity Moody, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit, said: "We know that there were around six or seven people on the bus at the time and we would urge them to contact us if they have not already done so.

"I know officers spoke to several people at the scene, but we believe there are still some witnesses we have yet to trace.

"You can email me directly **Operation Triatic** in the subject line.

"You can also report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report or speak to an operator in our Force Communications Room via web chat here

"You can also call the non-emergency number 101, and ask for Herts Police."

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form.
