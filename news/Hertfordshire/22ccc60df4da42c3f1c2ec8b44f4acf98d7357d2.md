Police attended an address in Stanborough Close at around 5.30pm on Friday (March 16), following a report that a wanted man was at that location. Upon arrival at the flat, a man had locked himself inside the property and was throwing numerous objects at officers as well as making threats. He then climbed onto the roof of the building where he continued to make threats and throw objects. Tactical resources including police negotiators and firearms units were in attendance as a precaution, and Stanborough Road was closed at the junctions with Gosling Stadium and Osborn Way. Fire and ambulance services were also in attendance in order to assist with the operation. Four residents of neighbouring properties had to be temporarily housed in emergency accommodation. Road closures were lifted at around 5.30am on Saturday (March 17) and a 43-year-old man from Welwyn Garden City was arrested.

We would like to thank the public for their patience during this incident.

 * Jon Banks, aged 43, of Stanborough Close, Welwyn Garden City, has been charged with five counts of criminal damage, two of assault and one of affray. He was remanded in custody to appear at magistrates' court.
