Officers from the Welwyn Hatfield South Safer Neighbourhood Team were at Cuffley railway station yesterday (Thursday 19 September) showing commuters a new police feedback service.

Using the Constabulary's new feedback service echo, residents of Welwyn Hatfield are able to quickly and easily give their views on policing in the borough.

All the comments, both good and bad, are reviewed by police to ensure that Welwyn Hatfield remains a safe place to live and work.

Sergeant James Stopford said: "It's really important that residents tell us what they think we are doing well and what we could be doing better. I would encourage you to get in touch with your views. Working together means that we can create a safer Welwyn Hatfield."

In addition to showcasing echo, officers also gave commuters advice around keyless car thefts.

Sergeant Stopford continued: "Unfortunately, we have seen a rise in keyless cars being stolen in the Cuffley and Brookmans Park area over recent months. If you have a keyless car, please remember that you can help to deter thieves by placing the vehicle tablet key in a metal box or a card defender bag."
