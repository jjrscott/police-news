Police have released CCTV images of three men they would like to speak to following a number of burglaries in St Albans, Radlett, Potters Bar and the surrounding areas between the October 9th and 20th.

A Toyota Auris has been seen in the area at the time of the burglaries.

Police would like to speak to the men pictured as they may have been in the local areas at the time of the offences and may have witnessed what happened.

Anyone who recognises the men, or has any other information about the burglaries, can contact Detective Sergeant Jon Green by emailing or via the Hertfordshire Constabulary non-emergency number 101. You can also report information online.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
