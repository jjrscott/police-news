Police are appealing for information and witnesses following an attempted commercial burglary in Waltham Cross.

At around 2.15am on Wednesday, October 24 a large panel van was driven into the Banana Connection menswear shop in the High Street, causing damage to the shop's security shutters. The van failed to penetrate the shutters so the offender(s) drove the van to a nearby street and abandoned the vehicle.

PC Sam Joyce from the Broxbourne Local Crime Unit is leading the investigation and said: "We have reason to believe that there is some local knowledge about this incident within the community, which has caused significant financial loss to this local family business in the run up to Christmas. This has resulted in the shop having to be boarded up. If you have any information about what happened, we would be very keen to speak to you as you may hold details that will prove vital to the case."

Anyone who has any information is asked to contact PC Sam Joyce by emailing _sam.joyce@herts.pnn.police.uk_ , calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/49332/18 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/report.

Alternatively, if you'd rather provide information anonymously contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
