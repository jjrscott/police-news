Two people have been arrested following robberies in Bishop's Stortford during the early hours of Friday, August 31.

At around 1.30am, a group of people were approached by two men in Sworders Field. A 17-year-old girl subsequently had cash stolen from her, while a man aged in his 20s was punched in the face.

It was later reported to police that a 19-year-old woman had also been threatened during a similar incident at the same location, around 30 minutes beforehand. A small amount of cash was taken from her.

A 19-year-old man from Bishop's Stortford has been released on police bail until September 28.

A 17-year-old boy, also from the town, has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
