Officers investigating the theft of a purse in Apsley have released images of a man they would like to speak to as part of their enquiries.

It happened at Sainsbury's on London Road between 11am and midday on Wednesday, November 28.

The victim, a woman in her 70s, returned her trolley to the bay after she had finished shopping. She went to put the £1 used to borrow the trolley back in her purse, but after looking in her handbag she discovered it was gone.

A short time later, £300 was withdrawn from her account. The victim has since had this reimbursed.

PCSO Jake Smith, from the Hemel South East Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "We are keen to speak to the man pictured as we believe he was in the area at the time and may have information which could help progress our investigation."

If you recognise him, or have any further information, please call the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/60855/18. You can also report information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report or speak to a call operator in our Force Communications Room via online web chat.
