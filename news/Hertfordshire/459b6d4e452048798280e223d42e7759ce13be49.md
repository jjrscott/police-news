A man has pleaded guilty to five counts of burglary following a series of break-ins in Sawbridgeworth earlier this week.

The incidents occurred at business and community premises in the town on Monday, March 25. Cash and a laptop were stolen and several windows were damaged.

Jake Smith, aged 26, of no fixed address, was arrested on Wednesday, March 27 and subsequently charged.

He appeared before Hatfield Remand Court today (Friday, March 29) where he pleaded guilty to all offences and was remanded into custody, ahead of sentencing at St Albans Crown Court on Monday, April 29.
