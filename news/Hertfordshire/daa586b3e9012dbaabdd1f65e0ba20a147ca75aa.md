* ### Fraudster jailed for £27,000 Rolex watch scam.

 * ### Rashidul Islam, 32, jailed for three years and six months.

 * ### Elderly victim commended for helping to catch fraudster.

A man has been jailed in connection with a courier fraud against an elderly victim from Cheshunt.

The 93 year old victim was contacted by someone claiming to be a police officer from a fraud department. They claimed that the victim's bank account had been compromised and instructed her to purchase three Rolex watches, with a combined value of £27,000 which would be collected by a courier employed by the police.

The victim became suspicious and managed to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary without alerting the offenders. She then worked with officers from the Serious Fraud and Cyber Unit for three days, fielding numerous calls from the offenders and maintaining a cover story until a courier was dispatched to the address.

Rashidul Islam, 32, from Ivy Road, Cricklewood, was subsequently arrested and charged with fraud, appearing at St Albans Crown Court on 5 July 2019. He was found guilty following a seven day trial and sentenced to three years and six months imprisonment.

At the conclusion of the trial Her Honour Judge Wigin commended the bravery of the victim, recommending her for a High Sheriff's award. On 12 August the victim attended St Albans Crown Court where she received an award for meritorious conduct from High Sheriff Mrs Sarah Beazley.

Detective Constable Julian Griffiths from Hertfordshire Constabulary's Serious Fraud and Cyber Unit said: "The victim showed extraordinary bravery and tenacity to support the investigation and without this we would not have brought the offenders to justice.

"I'm delighted that this bravery has been recognised by Her Honour Judge Wigin. Thankfully the victim recognised that the phone calls she received were bogus and had the presence of mind to contact the police. Anyone in a similar situation should be aware that police officers will never contact you in this way and ask you to withdraw money, make electronic transfers or purchase goods and vouchers. If you are in any doubt contact the police on 101 using a different phone."
