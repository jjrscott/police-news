A drug dealer who ran a county lines drug network in Hemel Hempstead has been jailed for four and a half years.

 Officers from Hertfordshire Constabulary's Operation Support Group arrested Palitey Faye at an address in Coleridge Crescent, Hemel Hempstead on 26 June 2019, after a warrant was served on the property. Officers discovered cocaine in the property with an estimated value of over Â£12,000.

Palitey Faye, 22, of Southborough Road, London, appeared at Luton Crown Court on 7 August, where he was sentenced to four and a half years for possession with intent to supply class A drug (crack cocaine) after pleading guilty.

PC Rob Harlow from Hertfordshire Constabulary's Operational Support Group, said: "We continue to target those who are involved in county lines drug dealing. These criminals set up their operations in our towns and bring violence, drugs and crime into our communities. Young and vulnerable people are often the ones who suffer the most, being drawn into criminal activities, drugs and even sexual exploitation.

"We have made a significant impact on the county lines networks operating in Hertfordshire over the last year, disrupting gang activities and seizing large quantities of drugs and cash during these operations.

"We continue to work with partners to raise awareness of county lines among young people, parents, teachers and other members of the community to help protect the vulnerable and prevent them from being pulled into this kind of activity."
