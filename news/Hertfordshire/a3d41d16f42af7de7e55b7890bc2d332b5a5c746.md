Following the public's feedback, the Welwyn Hatfield Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT) have announced their new policing priorities for the borough.

The SNT are responsible for fixing short and long-term neighbourhood issues such as anti-social behaviour and they work with local partners, including the council, to ensure that Welwyn Hatfield is a safe place to live and work.

Welwyn Hatfield Safer Neighbourhood Team Inspector Kash Hussain said: "Using our community voice platform echo, we've received really useful feedback from residents telling us their views on what we should be prioritising.

"My teams will be working hard over the next few months to tackle these issues. We know that speeding is a problem affecting residents' quality of life and I'm pleased to say that we've trained up more officers to use the speed gun so you can expect to see more fines being given to those who have no consideration for other drivers and pedestrians.

"Please keep your feedback coming by using echo. Simply go to bit.ly/police-welhat and have your say."
