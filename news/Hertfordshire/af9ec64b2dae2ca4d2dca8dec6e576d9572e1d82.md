Police are re-appealing for the public's help to find a woman who has gone missing from Watford.

Amuun Mohamed, aged 21, who is from the town, was last seen near her home at around 10pm on Friday, August 10.

She is described as black, around 5ft 8ins tall, of slim build with shoulder length black hair.

Amuun was last seen wearing a large silver jumper, a blue tracksuit with a white vertical stripe and black sandals.

She has links to Milton Keynes, Birmingham and London.

Police are growing increasingly concerned for Amuun's welfare. Anyone who has seen her or believes they know where she is should contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101. If you are with Amuun or have been with her in the last few moments please call 999.
