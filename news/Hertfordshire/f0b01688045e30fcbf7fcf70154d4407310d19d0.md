Officers investigating a distraction burglary in Bushey are releasing a photo of a man they would like to speak with who may be able to assist with their enquiries.

At around 2.30pm on Thursday, March 21, a woman saw a man standing outside her house in Belmont Road by the front door. He asked her if she would like her windows cleaned and had what appeared to be a flyer in his hand, to which the woman replied no and the man left.

The victim closed her front door and noticed her handbag had been moved and her purse was missing from it, which contained cash and bank cards.

It is believed an offender entered the address via an unlocked door and took the purse while the victim was upstairs.

Officers would like to speak with the man pictured as he may have information which could assist with the investigation.

Any witnesses or anyone with information should contact DC Daniel Evans on _daniel.evans@herts.pnn.police.uk_ or the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/26331/19. You can also report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report
