**Specialist officers have eliminated a person from their investigation into an incident of malicious communications following a football match in Watford.**

**On Monday 2 March, Hertfordshire Constabulary were made aware of an offensive image referencing the Hillsborough disaster.**

**The image was reportedly posted on a football-related social media site following the Watford v Liverpool match at Vicarage Road on Saturday 29 February.**

**Officers launched an investigation and identified a person of interest. They have since had an extensive conversation with the person in question and have subsequently eliminated them from the enquiry.**

**PC Dani Howlett-Bolton, Hate Crime Officer for Watford, said: "By their very nature, these types of crimes are difficult to investigate and we have conducted extensive enquiries so far, as well as working in close partnership with Watford FC. **

**" We are now looking into exactly how the image was posted to that particular site using that particular profile. **

**" This has caused great distress and upset to the families of all 96 people who died as a result of the Hillsborough disaster.**

**" I am asking anyone who has information about who may be responsible for this incident to do the right thing and come forward to speak to me as a matter of urgency.**

**" We are particularly interested in speaking to anyone who has a copy of the original Facebook post, including the URL link which can be found in the internet browser's address bar."**

**You can report information online at** **www.herts.police.uk/report** **, speak to an operator in our Force Communications Room via web chat at** **www.herts.police.uk/contact** **or call non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/19384/20.**
