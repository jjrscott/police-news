A total of 36 weapons and more than 500 rounds of ammunition were handed into Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire police forces as a result of a national firearms surrender campaign that ran between Saturday 20 July and Sunday 4 August.

Of these, two war trophy handguns, two shotguns, seven air weapons and a blank firing replica pistol were surrendered in Hertfordshire. More than 150 rounds of live shotgun and rifle ammunition was also handed in.

Chief Supt Catherine Akehurst, Firearms Surrender Campaign Lead for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire police forces said: "As a result of the surrender campaign a number of illegally held, lethal firearms are now safely off the streets and away from criminal hands.

"Although the campaign has now ended the three forces will continue to work closely with partners and local communities to proactively tackle gun crime."

Hertfordshire Police and Crime Commissioner, David Lloyd, said: "Our knife amnesty earlier this year was a great success and it is good to see that repeated with guns.

"Although our county does not have a big issue with gun crimes, every one that is taken off the streets could prevent a tragedy."

If anyone knows someone who illegally owns a weapon, they should call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
