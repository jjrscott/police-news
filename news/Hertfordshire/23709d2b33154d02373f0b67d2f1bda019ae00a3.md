* ### Police to old property marking event in Welwyn Garden City.

 * ### Property marking helps to secure your possessions from theft.

 * ### Why not bring your property along on the day?

Officers from Welwyn Hatfield North's Safer Neighbourhood Team are holding a property and bike marking event at Welwyn Garden City Police Station, Rosanne House, Bridge Road on Saturday, March 17.

The event will be held between midday and 4pm and will see Safer Neighbourhood Team police officers and Police Community Support Officers (PSCOs) offering the public the chance to have their property or bicycles security marked.

**Safer Neighbourhood Team Sergeant David Stansbury, said:** "Bikes, gadgets and tools can be tempting to would-be thieves.

"Property and bike marking can help to keep possessions more secure because if they are stolen, there is more chance we can reunite them with their rightful owners if recovered.

"It can also act as a deterrent to thieves. If we catch a thief with a bike which has been security marked, we can quickly establish that a crime has been committed and make an arrest.

"Why not come along to the event to have your property security marked and give yourself peace of mind that your valuables are more secure?"

**There are some other very simple things you can do to deter opportunist thieves from stealing your bike or other valuables:**

• Register your bike and valuables on, a free online property database which police use to check stolen property. That way, if your bike or property does get stolen, you have more chance of them being returned to you.

• Never leave your bike unlocked - even if you're just popping into the newsagents. The best kind of lock is a quality solid steel D-shaped shackle lock. You can buy these at any bike shop.

• If you are at home make sure your bike is locked away securely.

• Always lock your bike to something solid like a lamp-post or railings, preferably in a public area.

• If you have quick release wheels, take off the front wheel and lock it to the frame and back wheel.

• If you have a pump or detachable lights take them with you when you leave your bike.

• Make sure you have adequate insurance cover for your bike.

• Mark the frame of your bike with your postcode using a UV pen or contact your local cycle shop, as most will mark them for a small cost. You can contact us for advice on other property marking initiatives available on 101.
