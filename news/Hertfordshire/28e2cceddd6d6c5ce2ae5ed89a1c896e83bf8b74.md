 * ### We are appealing for witnesses and information

Officers are appealing for information and witnesses following a stabbing incident in St Albans.

Police were called just after 8.30pm yesterday (Sunday 6 September) to reports that a man had been stabbed in the Hill End Lane area.

A 35 year old was seriously injured and taken to hospital with life-changing injuries.

Detective Inspector Nick Rega said: "We know there were a number of people in the area at the time of the offence. If you saw what happened and have not yet spoken to police please get in touch. If you were in the area at the time and have a dash cam fitted to your vehicle please check the footage to see if you have captured anything that could be used as evidence."

You can report information online at herts.police.uk/report, speak to an operator in our Force Communications Room via our online web chat at herts.police.uk/contact or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting Op Phota of 6 September.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
