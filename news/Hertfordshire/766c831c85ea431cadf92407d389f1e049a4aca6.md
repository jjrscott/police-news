Police were called at 7.54am this morning (March 22) to reports of concern for the welfare of a man and woman at an address in Darrs Lane, Northchurch.

Officers entered the property alongside the ambulance service and sadly two people inside were pronounced dead at the scene.

The circumstances around the deaths are currently being investigated and police remain at the scene.

This appears to be an isolated incident and we are not seeking anyone else in connection with this.
