Detectives in North Herts are re-appealing for the public's help to trace a man they would like to speak to in connection with a burglary at Lordship Cottages in Willian, Letchworth.

The incident happened just after Christmas on December 27. It is believed that one offender forced the front door and then searched the house, while another searched a garden shed. Jewellery, watches, handbags and belts were taken.

Officers would like to speak to the man pictured as they believe he was in the area at the time and could have information which will help the investigation.

If you recognise the man pictured please contact Detective Simon Goodship in the North Herts Local Crime Unit via the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/69907/19. You can also report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.
