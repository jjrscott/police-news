A man from Baldock has been fined for breaching COVID-19 regulations after police were called to his house at around 8.45pm on 4 December.

There were a large number of people at the property in London Road who began to disperse on police arrival.

Officers were called back to the location later in the evening and then again into the early hours to reports of people having returned.

The 29-year-old man was issued with a Â£100 fine today (6 December).

Chief Superintendent Matt Nicholls, who is leading the Constabulary's response to COVID-19, said: "We appreciate the impact these regulations have on our communities but it is vital we all do our part to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

"We are grateful to the majority of our communities who have been adhering to the rules but where breaches do occur we will deal robustly.

"Hertfordshire Constabulary will not tolerate serious cases of disregard to the rules and as this action shows, those intent on ignoring the law will be dealt with and educated in a swift and robust manner."
