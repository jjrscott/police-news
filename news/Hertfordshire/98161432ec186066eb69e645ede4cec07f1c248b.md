Police are releasing CCTV images of three males they would like to speak to as part of enquiries following an incident of shoplifting in Hatfield.

At around 3.30pm on Thursday, November 8, three offenders entered JD Sports in the The Galleria on Comet Way and asked staff to get items from out the back to try on.

The males then grabbed hundreds of pounds worth of Adidas and North Face clothing while staffing levels were vulnerable, before leaving the store without paying.

The three offenders left The Galleria through the main entrance and went out onto Cavendish Way before taking the underpass.

Officers believe the three men pictured may have information that can assist the investigation.

Anyone who recognises them or any witnesses to the crime is asked to contact PC Darren Turner by emailing _darren.turner@herts.pnn.police.uk_ , calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/54347/18 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
