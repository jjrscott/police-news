Officers are appealing for witnesses to an incident involving a cyclist in Rickmansworth that occurred today (Friday, February 2).

At around 12.30pm, for reasons unknown at this stage, a cyclist came off his bicycle in Harefield Road. Sadly, despite the best efforts of members of the public and emergency services the man, aged in his 40s, died at the scene.

 Sergeant William Hood, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit, said: "At this early stage it is unclear exactly what has happened to this man and I am appealing for anyone who saw him cycling along the road around the time stated to get in touch as you may have information that can help our investigation."

 Anyone with information is asked to contact Sgt Hood by calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting ISR 347 of February 2 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/report.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
