Police are releasing a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to as part of their enquiries following reports of verbal abuse in Hatfield.

Between 1.40pm and 1.45pm on Sunday, February 24, a member of staff at the Next store on Comet Way was verbally abused by a man after he tried to return items without a receipt or labels on the items. When the transaction was refused, he shouted at the staff member and another man who tried to intervene.

Officers would like to speak to the man pictured as they believe he was in the area at the time of the offence and may have information that could assist the investigation.

Anyone with information is asked to contact PC Aimee Smith by emailing, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/18078/19 or report information online.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form.
