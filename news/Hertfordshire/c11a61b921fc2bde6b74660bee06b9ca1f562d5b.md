* ### Do you recognise this man?

 * ### He's a suspect in an investigation into an incident of outraging public decency.

 * ### A man exposed and touched himself inappropriately in front of a group of teenage girls in Chorleywood.

Detectives investigating an incident of outraging public decency are releasing an e-fit of a suspect they would like to identify.

Between 4.15pm and 4.45pm on Monday, May 7, a man exposed and touched himself inappropriately near to a group of teenage girls on The Common in Chorleywood.

Detective Constable Paul Burton, who is investigating, said: "Understandably this man's actions made the girls feel very uncomfortable and they left the area.

"I'm appealing for anyone who recognises the man pictured or was in the area around the times stated and believes they have information that could help our investigation to get in touch."

If you have any information please contact DC Burton by emailing paul.burton@herts.pnn.police.uk, calling the Hertfordshire Constabulary non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference C2/18/1353 or report information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
