Today (Monday, March 19) we are responding to reports of bomb threats at six schools in Hertfordshire. We'd like to reassure local communities that officers are in contact with the schools involved and at this stage there is no evidence to suggest these threats are credible.

The schools are Abbots Hill in Hemel Hempstead, Valley School in Stevenage, The Sele School in Hertford, Duncombe School in Hertford, Stanborough School in Watford and St Albans High School For Girls.

A number of schools in other parts of the country have made similar reports to their local police forces.

We take incidents of this nature extremely seriously and an investigation is underway.

Anyone with information that may assist the investigation is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101, quoting ISR 172 of March 19 or report information online. Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
