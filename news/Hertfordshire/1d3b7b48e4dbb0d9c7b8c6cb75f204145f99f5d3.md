Officers are appealing for the public's help to trace a teenager missing from his home in Welwyn Garden City.

15 year old Renis Vladi has been missing since Sunday, October 14. It is believed that he left home at around midday to catch a train into London.

Renis is described as white, with brown eyes and short brown hair. He is tall and was last seen wearing a blue jacket, grey trousers and trainers.

Officers are growing increasingly concerned for Renis's welfare.

If you have seen Renis since he went missing, or have information on his whereabouts, call 101 quoting ISR 793 of October 14. For immediate sightings, please call 999 straight away.
