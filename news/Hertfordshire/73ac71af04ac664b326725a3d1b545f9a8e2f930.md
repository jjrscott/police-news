Officers investigating an incident of criminal damage in Hitchin are appealing for information and witnesses.

It happened in Market Square sometime between 9.30pm on Tuesday, July 31 and 6.30am on Wednesday, August 1.

Offender(s) damaged a children's helter skelter ride by removing a number of plastic covers from lights on the structure.

The helter skelter mats had been thrown around the vicinity of the square and a wooden stool was also smashed. The gate at the foot of the helter skelter was damaged and a nearby children's train ride was also tampered with.

PC Andy Hadden, who is investigating, said: "This mindless vandalism meant that the owners of these rides were not able to open them to the public until they had been fixed, meaning their business was affected.

"I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed what happened, or saw anyone acting suspiciously in the area, to please come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to email PC Hadden on andrew.hadden@herts.police.uk, report online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference number 41/23103/18.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
