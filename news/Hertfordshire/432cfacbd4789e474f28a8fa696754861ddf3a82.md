Officers in Stevenage are appealing for help and information in order to trace a wanted man.

Scott Musicka, aged 29, is wanted in connection with a burglary which took place in the Pin Green area of Stevenage on Tuesday, November 13. Police believe he could be in the Welwyn Hatfield area, which is where he is originally from.

Anyone who has any information regarding Musicka's whereabouts is asked to contact police on 101. Anyone with him now or who has seen him in the last few moments should call 999. The crime reference number is 51/55606/18.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
