Police are re-appealing to members of the public to help trace a man who is wanted.

Andrew Ferguson, who is 42 years old and whose last known address is Stanborough Green in Welwyn Garden City, is wanted for failing to appear in court on October 10 this year in connection with driving offences.

Andrew also has connections to the Hatfield area.

Anyone who has seen him or who knows of his whereabouts is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101 or report information online.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
