Officers are appealing for information and witnesses following a serious collision in Letchworth last night (Thursday, September 6).

Shortly before 8.15pm, a pedestrian and a black Ford Fiesta were involved in a collision in Station Road.

Officers are now working to establish the circumstances that led to the collision.

PC Carl Callan, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit, said: "The pedestrian, a man in his forties, was taken to hospital with serious injuries.

"I am appealing for anyone who saw what happened, or the events leading up to the collision to get in touch as you could have vital information.

"If you were in the area, and have a dash cam fitted to your vehicle, I would also like to hear from you as you may be able to assist us.

"If you can help, please contact me on _carl.callan@herts.pnn.police.uk_ or the non-emergency number 101, quoting ISR 814 of September 6."
