Officers investigating an assault in St Albans are appealing for information and witnesses.

It happened in St Peter's Street, outside the Metro Bank, at 3.30pm on Sunday, October 21.

The victim, a man in his 40s, was walking on the pavement when he was approached by the offender, who lunged at him before punching him twice in the face.

He then made off, leaving the victim with swelling, pain and bruising to his cheek. It is believed the offender and the victim are known to one another.

PC Lee Hammond, who is investigating, said: "This assault happened in the city centre at a time when there were a large number of people in the area, some of whom witnessed the incident.

"At the time, the victim did not stop to speak to anyone as he just wanted to get away from the area, however we are now keen to trace any people who saw what happened.

"If you can help, please email me at lee.hammond@herts.pnn.police.uk, call the non-emergency number 101 or report information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report, quoting reference 41/48521/18."
