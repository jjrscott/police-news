Officers from the Welwyn Hatfield West Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT) recently held cyber-crime advice sessions at Tesco Extra and The Galleria, Hatfield.

The sessions formed part of #Mulletover, a national campaign against cyber-crime and fraud.

The team were joined by the Constabulary's Serious Fraud and Cyber Unit. They spoke to up to eighty local residents, giving them advice on how they can protect themselves online.

Welwyn Hatfield West SNT Sergeant Pauline Flanagan said: "As well learning some tips on how to stay safe from online scams, residents also got the opportunity to sign up to Neighbourhood Watch, which allows you to stay up-to-date with important information around local crime.

"If you haven't already signed up, go to www.owl.co.uk.

"Online scams can often be very convincing so it's worthwhile reading through the crime prevention advice on our website at www.herts.police.uk/information-and-services/advice/crime-prevention."
