Police are appealing for information and witnesses following four linked robberies in Bushey's King George Recreation Ground on Saturday evening (5 September).

Between 8.45pm and 9.45pm four teenage boys - three aged 15 and one aged 16 - were separately targeted by four men who forced them to hand over their mobile phones and pin numbers.

One of the offenders had a large knife and one of the victims - the 16-year-old boy - had the knife pressed against his face. The boy did not require medical treatment.

The offenders are described as all men. One was wearing all grey clothing and the other three were wearing dark coloured clothing. One of the men had a bandana covering his face while another was wearing a surgical face mask.

Detective Sergeant Chris Parperi said: "This would have been a terrifying ordeal for the victims. My officers are keeping in touch with them and their families to ensure they are receiving any support they require.

"We are treating these robberies as linked as we believe they were carried out by the same four offenders and significant enquiries are taking place to identify the men.

"While our investigation continues you can expect to see an increased police presence in the park and local Safer Neighbourhood Officers will be carrying out a beat surgery this evening between 6.30pm and 7.30pm. If you have any information about the robberies you would like to share with us or perhaps you would just like to speak to an officer please come and see us in the park."
