* ### Westmill residents invited to take part in Environmental Action Day

 * ### Local officers join partners in tour of the estate to identify issues that need addressing

 * ### Low level crime and ASB will be targetted by the special patrols

Residents on the Westmill Estate in Hitchin, who are keen to see improvements in their local area, are being invited to take part in a special Environmental Action Day on Tuesday 10 September.

Between 10am and 12.30pm representatives from North Herts District Council (NHDC) and settle Housing will be joining PC Courtney Ferguson on a visit to the area to meet with local residents and to identify issues which need addressing.

Conducting a co-ordinated patrol of the estate they aim to deal with issues relating to low level crime and anti-social behaviour, as well as offering face-to-face advice to residents.

Settle Housing will be offering tenancy and housing advice and NHDC will be addressing issues relating to dog fouling, litter, graffiti and other environmental concerns.

PC Ferguson said: "These Environmental Action Days provide a great opportunity for all the agencies to talk directly with local residents, addressing any early signs of crime or anti-social behaviour in the area to help prevent them from escalating further.

"We hope to see as many residents as possible on the day."

If you cannot be there on the day but would like to speak to PC Ferguson, he can be contacted via 101. For more information about your Safer Neighbourhood Team, visit www.herts.police.uk/your-area .
