A woman was arrested and a quantity of suspected drugs were seized after a warrant was executed at an address in Watford this morning (Monday, December 10).

Officers from the Safer Neighbourhood and Op Scorpion teams carried out the operation at a property in Nottingham Close, under the Misuse of Drugs Act.

Quantities of suspected Class A and B drugs were seized, along with cash.

A 24-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply, possession of criminal property, fraud and theft. She remains in police custody at this time.

PC Jonathan Lister, from the North Watford Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "Today's operation was part of our ongoing work to disrupt those suspected of being involved in drug crime and associated criminality.

"If you suspect drug crime in your neighbourhood, please report it to police so we can build up an intelligence picture and take the necessary action to make Watford a hostile place for criminals to operate."
