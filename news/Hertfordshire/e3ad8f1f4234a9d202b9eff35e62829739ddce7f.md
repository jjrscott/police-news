Officers are appealing for the public's help in locating a missing teenager from Watford.

Fifteen-year-old Chelsea Binfield was last seen at her home address in the town at around 11.20am on Wednesday, February 14.

Chelsea is described as white, of medium build and around 5ft 9ins tall. She has straight, shoulder length auburn hair and has green eyes.

She was last seen wearing a white cropped top, blue ripped jeans and a blue jacket.

Officers and Chelsea's family are growing increasingly concerned for her welfare and ask anyone who sees her, or has any other information about her whereabouts, to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via 101.
