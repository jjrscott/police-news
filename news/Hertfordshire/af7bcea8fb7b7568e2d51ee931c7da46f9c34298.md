Officers from the Welwyn Hatfield South Safer Neighbourhood Team are hosting a surgery on Saturday, March 9, giving residents an opportunity to speak to officers face-to-face.

The surgery will be held at North Mymms Memorial Hall in Station Road, Welham Green from 10am to 12pm.

PCSO Samantha Griffin, from the Welwyn Hatfield South Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "I'd encourage anyone who might have any concerns they'd like to discuss to come along and have a chat so we can try and help you.

"We'll be issuing crime prevention advice at the surgery and we will also be happy to security mark your bicycles free of charge. Bike marking can help to keep them more secure because if they are stolen, there is more chance we can reunite them with their rightful owners if recovered. A bicycle that has been security marked is harder for thieves to sell on.

"Please do drop by and say hello - we're looking forward to meeting as many of you as possible."
