A man has been charged in connection with three indecent exposures on Croxley Moor.

Dumitru Dita, aged 34, of Kingsbury Road, London, has been charged with three counts of outraging public decency.

Detective Sergeant Darren Machin, from the Three Rivers Local Crime Unit, said: "These charges are in connection with three separate incidents on Croxley Moor, between Friday 17 July and Wednesday 5 August.

"In each incident, a man indecently exposed himself to female victims who were walking on the moor. The victims in each case have been supported by our investigating officer, and kept updated throughout.

"The arrest and subsequent charges have been achieved as a result of some excellent proactive joint-working by officers and detectives from the Three Rivers Local Crime Unit, Intervention and Operation Scorpion teams respectively."

Dita has been released on conditional bail and is scheduled to appear at St Albans Magistrates' Court on Friday 9 October.
