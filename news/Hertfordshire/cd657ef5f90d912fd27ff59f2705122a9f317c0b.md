Officers are appealing to trace the owners of a number of recovered items they believe to be stolen.

The items, which include jewellery, were recovered from a vehicle in Dunstable on Wednesday, August 22.

Detective Constable Simon Smith, from the Specialist Investigation Team based at Hatfield police station, said: "A number of these items are very distinctive and we would like to reunite them with their rightful owners.

"We believe they could have been stolen from locations in Hertfordshire, possibly St Albans, and Bedfordshire - specifically the Luton and Dunstable area."

If you think that any of these items may be yours, please call Hertfordshire Constabulary or Bedfordshire Police - depending on your location - on 101, quoting Operation Bridal.
