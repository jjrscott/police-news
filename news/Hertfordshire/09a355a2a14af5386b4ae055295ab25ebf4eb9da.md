Twelve new Special Constables were warmly welcomed into Hertfordshire Constabulary during their Attestation Ceremony at Police Headquarters on Thursday, December 20.

Special Constables have full police powers, uniform and protective equipment and work alongside the regular force.

During eleven weeks of training, the new recruits learnt about basic law around theft, public order, assaults, traffic, powers of arrest and Stop and Search. They also used a virtual learning environment which trained them in legislation.

Each graduate went through a rigorous selection process and had to pass a final exam and practical assessments to enable them to qualify for the role of Special Constable.

Those that graduated are:

 * **Sophie Smith** , who will be based at Borehamwood Police Station
 * **Philip Duignan,** who will be based at Hertford Police Station
 * **George Woods** , who will be based at Hemel Hempstead Police Station
 * **Lamees Hoteit** , who will be based at Rickmansworth Police Station
 * **Ashley Roe,** who will be based at St Albans Police Station
 * **Keileigh Rankin** , who will be based at Stevenage Police Station
 * **Jason Briers** , who will be based at Stevenage Police Station
 * **Deborah Hatton** , who will be based at Stevenage Police Station
 * **Benjamin Somerville-Roberts** , who will be based at Stevenage Police Station
 * **Isaaq Yunis,** who will be based at Watford Police Station
 * **Wayne Loeber** , who will be based at Watford Police Station
 * **Graham Mcclymont** , who will be based at Watford Police Station.

They were attested in front of their family and friends, and local dignitaries.

Over the next 12 months, the new recruits will continue their training, allowing them to pass out as substantive Special Constables once they are assessed as fit for independent patrol.

**Assistant Chief Constable Nathan Briant awarded the Specials with their certificates. He said:** "It is a great honour to welcome these new Special Constables to the Constabulary. The work they do is vital in helping us to police the county. I want to wish them all well as they now move on to undertake this important role within the communities of Hertfordshire.

**" Special Constabulary Chief Officer, Mark Kendrew said:** "I was delighted to meet our new Special Constables and I am very proud to welcome them to our dedicated team. Becoming a Special Constable brings with it the promise of being involved in something exciting, worthwhile and that makes a real difference in the local community as well as having the chance to learn new skills. I have no doubt they will make a significant contribution to policing in Hertfordshire."

**Deputy Chief Executive from the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner for Hertfordshire, Gavin Miles said:** "I am delighted to welcome our new Specials into what is an expanding police team in Hertfordshire. We're very fortunate to have such a dedicated team of Special Constables, who bring a wealth of skills and life experience to policing. I wish them all the very best as they embark on their first shifts."

**Recruitment of Special Constables**

Hertfordshire Constabulary is actively recruiting Special Constables. Special Constables get involved in all areas of frontline policing - from high visibility patrols around pubs and clubs at the weekend and being called to assist at the scene of a road traffic collision or burglary to arresting offenders or reassuring and advising residents after a crime has occurred.

Aside from 'response' or local Safer Neighbourhood policing, there are constantly evolving opportunities to work within specialist policing environments.

Once initial training is complete, Specials are coached by regular officers to complete their Police Action Checklists and are then deemed fit for independent patrol. On average this can take around 12 months.
