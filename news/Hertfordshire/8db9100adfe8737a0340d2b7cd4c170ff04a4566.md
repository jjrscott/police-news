A 51 year old man from Stevenage has been given a two year restraining order following his appearance at Stevenage Magistrates Court yesterday (Monday 25 March).

Barry Harding of Penn Road in Stevenage is now banned from entering any Co-op store in Hertfordshire or Bedfordshire for two years. He is also banned from contacting a member of Co-Op staff.

The order was enforced after Harding was charged and found guilty of a malicious communication offence which he committed in December 2018.

Detective Sergeant Fay Tooley said: "This offence has been extremely upsetting for the victim, who only knew Harding through her work. We carried out a thorough investigation and are pleased that the court have taken this positive action to safeguard the victim from any future interaction."
