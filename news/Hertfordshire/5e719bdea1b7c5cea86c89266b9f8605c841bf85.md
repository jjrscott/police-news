Officers investigating a theft from a shop are releasing an image of a man who may be able to help them with their enquiries.

At around 6.20pm on Tuesday, August 18, a man entered the Co-op store in New Road, Croxley Green and placed steaks in a bag before leaving without paying for them.

PCSO Katie Welch said: "We believe the man pictured may have been in the store at the time of the offence and may have information that can help with our investigation. If you recognise him or have any information that could assist us please get in touch."
