* ### Police are permitted to stop and search people suspected of carrying knives in Hatfield overnight

 * ### Two areas have been designated for use of Section 60 powers

 * ### It follows a number of incidents in the areas in recent days

Officers in Hatfield have been given authorisation to stop and search members of the public suspected to be carrying knives from 6pm this evening (Sunday 1 November) to 9am tomorrow (Monday 2 November), under Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.

The Section 60 applies to two areas in the attached maps and means that anyone in these areas may be searched for weapons without the police officer having reasonable grounds of suspicion for each person searched.

This legislation is different to the stop and search powers they already have, which can be used at any time but when used officers must have reasonable grounds.

Chief Inspector Simon Mason, from Welwyn Hatfield police, said: "We've taken this action following a number of recent incidents in this area."

He added: "I would like to reassure residents that we are working closely with the university to investigate these incidents and bring any offenders to justice, we have increased our patrols in the area.

"I'd also like to make it clear; there are serious consequences if you choose to carry a knife. Not only will you face a possible custodial sentence and criminal record, which could affect your job prospects in later life, but you could cause yourself or another person serious injury."
