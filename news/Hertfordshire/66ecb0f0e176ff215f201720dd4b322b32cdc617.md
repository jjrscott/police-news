Police are appealing for help and information to trace 19 year old Omar Joof from Hitchin.

Omar is wanted for an assault on an emergency worker, which took place in Tilehouse Street on 9 July.

If you are with Omar now or have seen him very recently call 999.

Alternatively you can report information online at herts.police.uk/report, speak to an operator in our Force Communications Room via our online web chat at herts.police.uk/contact or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/53723/20.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
