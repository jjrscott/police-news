Wanted Daniel Smith

Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a man who is wanted in connection with a burglary investigation.

Daniel Smith, aged 38, who is believed to be in the Enfield area, is wanted in connection with a burglary that occurred in Cheshunt on June 11.

Anyone who sees him or has information about his whereabouts is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101, or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report quoting crime reference: 41/6551/18.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
