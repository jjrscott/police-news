Police are appealing for witnesses and information following the theft of lead from a church roof.

The theft occurred at St Augustine's Church in Broxbourne between June 8 and June 15, when around nine panels of lead were removed from the roof.

Anyone who has any information is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference Crime Ref 41/7864/18 or report information online.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
