Do you live in the rural areas around Royston and are you interested in having a say in what your local police concentrate on as priorities?

If the answer to this is 'yes' then your local police team would like to meet you.

Every six months the Safer Neighbourhood Police teams review and set their local policing priorities. **These are the issues that affect local communities at a local level**.

The Royston Rural Safer Neighbourhood team are holding an informal public meeting at Kelshall Village Hall. Kelshall Green, SG8 9SE **on Thursday 30th January between 7.30 and 9pm** to hear your views.

So if you would like to find out more about how local communities are policed, have an issue you would like to raise, or would just like to meet your local officers, then pop along and meet the team.

For further information you can contact the team.

If you cannot make the meeting we would still like to hear from you. You can tell us what matters most to you about policing, crime or anti-social behaviour in North Herts using echo. Go to bit.ly/police-nherts and have your say.
