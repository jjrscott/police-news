Officers are appealing for information and witnesses following a racially aggravated assault in Hatfield.

The incident happened at around 12.30pm on Saturday, April 6, in the Galleria car park, close to McDonald's.

The victim, a 44 year old woman, and the offender were involved in a verbal altercation while they were both in cars. The offender made racist remarks to the victim and then punched her on the nose, causing it to bleed.

The offender is described as white, aged around 50, with brown hair tied up in a bun. She was wearing a black jacket or blazer and black trousers. She spoke with an Irish accent and was the passenger in a white Toyota Land Cruiser.

PC Abi Wilkins, who is investigating, said: "Hate crimes will not be tolerated in Hertfordshire and we are doing all we can to trace the offender.

"I am appealing for anyone who was in the area and might have seen what happened to get in touch.

"If you can help, please call the non-emergency number 101 or email me at _abi.wilkins@herts.pnn.police.uk_ quoting crime reference 41/31480/19."
