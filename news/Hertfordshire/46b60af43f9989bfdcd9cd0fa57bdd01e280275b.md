Police in Stevenage are appealing for help and information in order to find a man they believe could assist them with their investigation into an assault.

The incident allegedly happened on Thursday February 1, between 10.30am and 11.20am in London Road. A woman was approached by a man outside Asda, who has then followed her and tried to kiss her.

Officers would like to speak to the man in the photo, as they believe he was in the area at the time and may have information which could help their inquiry.

If you recognise the man, or have any other information which could help the investigation, please contact PC Lee Chiveralls on 101 quoting crime reference number E1/18/865.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
