The family of Chris Bartram, who passed away following a collision on the A414, would like to share the following tribute:

**_Chris grew up in Waltham Abbey. As the older brother to Denise and Nick, he was often looked to for support. He and his wife Deb first lived in Enfield before spending the past 25 years in Bengeo._**

**_Chris 's pride and joy, his shiny blue Subaru, was well known among their neighbours. He also took a keen interest in gardening and wildlife._**

**_He was kind, caring and thoughtful and always ready to lend a hand if anyone needed it._**

**_His family and friends are absolutely devastated by this sudden, shocking loss and wish that their privacy is respected at this time._**

Chris, aged 59, passed away on Friday, August 3 following a collision on the A414 eastbound at Hertingfordbury.

Chris' family would also like to thank the emergency services, including the air ambulance medics along with the doctors and nurses at the Lister Hospital, who they say all worked so hard to save Chris.
