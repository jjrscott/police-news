The Welwyn Hatfield West Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT) are hosting a stall in the Birchwood area of Hatfield on Saturday (June 29), as part of a weekend focusing on crime prevention work.

Officers from the SNT and the Crime Reduction and Community Safety Unit will be running the stall outside the Co-op in Homestead Road between 1pm and 5pm.

Local residents are encouraged to come along and discuss any concerns or questions they might have.

Welwyn Hatfield SNT Inspector Wayne Nash said: "My team will be on hand to speak to residents face-to-face. We're here to keep you safe and this is a great opportunity to voice any concerns you might have. As well as giving out crime prevention advice, there'll also be plenty of freebies to give away, so if you're around please don't hesitate to drop by and say hello."

In addition to the stall, the team will be doing door-knocks in the Birchwood area between midday and 5pm on Friday, June 28 and Sunday, June 30.

Inspector Nash continued: "Our aim is to speak to every household in Birchwood to offer crime prevention advice to help keep them and their property safe throughout summer. Unfortunately, the area has recently seen a number of burglaries as well as thefts from and of vehicles. This crime prevention work is just one of the ways we are looking to tackle it.

"During this weekend, we will also be encouraging residents to sign up to Neighbourhood Watch, if they haven't already done so. Over 150,000 households in Hertfordshire have already signed up to receive emails about crime in their local neighbourhoods, making it one of the most successful schemes in the country. We're hoping to get as many households signed up as possible as it's a useful way of making sure that residents are up-to-date with important information."
