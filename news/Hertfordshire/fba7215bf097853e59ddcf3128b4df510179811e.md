Officers investigating two attempted arson offences on the same night in Hemel Hempstead have released an image of a man they would like to speak to as part of their enquiries.

They happened on Tannsfield Drive just after 8.40pm on Monday, April 16.

An offender first approached a Skoda Octavia, which was parked on the driveway of a property, and poured petrol on the bonnet.

They then walked up to a second car, a silver BMW, which was parked on an adjacent driveway, and also poured petrol on its bonnet before making off in the direction of Ellingham Road.
