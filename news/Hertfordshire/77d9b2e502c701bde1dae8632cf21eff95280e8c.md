On Wednesday 10 July, the Welwyn Hatfield North Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT) supported Isabel Hospice with their jail and bail fundraiser which saw over Â£6,000 raised.

PC Alex Smedley, PC Anne Lopez, PCSO Bill McCaskie, PCSO Cameron Abraham and SC Sam Moorby all took part in the event, along with Welwyn Hatfield Safer Neighbourhood Team Inspector Wayne Nash.

Inspector Nash said: "This was a really fun event and it was great to see the Welwyn Hatfield community come together and raise money for a fantastic local cause. The Welwyn Hatfield North SNT host a stall at the Howard Centre every Wednesday at 4pm and this was certainly one of the most memorable so far! Residents also got to learn about echo, new feedback service which allows the public to tell police what matters most to them about policing in their local area."

To use echo, simply send your views via SMS text to 66099 with the word Welhat. Alternatively, you can share your thoughts at any time by visiting www.bit.ly/police-welhat. The SNT will review your comments, good or bad, to help maintain a safer Welwyn Hatfield.
