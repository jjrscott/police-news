Officers have released a CCTV photo of a man they would like to speak to following an incident in Hoddesdon where a dog was stolen.

At around 3pm on Friday, January 18, the victim - a 71 year old woman, was walking her pet chihuahua, Luna, in Middlefield. Two offenders approached Luna and stroked her before one of them removed the lead and took her.

They then got into a black BMW 5 series (old style) and made off towards Ware Road.

Sergeant Stephen Lee, from the Broxbourne Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "It's believed that the man pictured was in the area at the time and could have information about what happened. If you recognise him, please get in touch.

"Luna's owner is understandably devastated. I would like people to take a look at the photo of Luna and get in touch if you think you have seen her since she was stolen.

"Similarly, any witnesses or anyone who believes they might have seen her for sale, should get in touch. Any information you may have, no matter how small it might seem, could help us return Luna to her owner.

"If you can help, please get in touch on the non-emergency number 101 or through email at SNTCheshuntWest@Herts.pnn.police.uk quoting crime reference 41/5871/19."
