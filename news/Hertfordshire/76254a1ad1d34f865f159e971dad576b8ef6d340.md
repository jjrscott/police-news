Officers investigating a burglary in which an elderly couple had sentimental jewellery stolen from their home in Hitchin are appealing for potential witnesses to come forward.

The incident took place between 5.15pm and 10.25pm on Wednesday 9 October at an address on Grovelands Avenue.

Offender(s) accessed the property through the back gate before completing an untidy search of the house where a number of bespoke jewellery pieces and a large amount of collectable coins were stolen.

Detective Constable Lea Parker from the Hitchin Local Crime Unit, who is investigating said: "The jewellery is quite distinctive especially the gold charm bracelet and some of the rings as they are unique.
