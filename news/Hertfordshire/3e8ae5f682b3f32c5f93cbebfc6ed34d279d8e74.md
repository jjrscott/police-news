Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a man who is wanted.

Mark Weekes, who is 41 years old and of no fixed address, is wanted on recall to prison.

He has links to the St Albans area.

Anyone who sees him or knows of his whereabouts is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary by calling 101 or report information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
