We are appealing for witnesses and information following a serious assault in Osinsky's nightclub in Market Place, Hitchin during the early hours of Saturday, December 23.

The incident took place at approximately 2am when the victim - a white man in his 40s from Letchworth - became involved in a verbal argument with a group of men within the club. One of the men pushed the victim to the floor and they then began punching and kicking him to the head. As a result the victim sustained serious facial injuries and was taken to hospital. He was later released but will need to undergo further surgery to treat his injuries.

**Investigating officer Detective Sergeant Will Ainsworth, from North Herts Local Crime Unit,** said: "This was an unprovoked attacked where the victim has sustained nasty facial injuries.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the club at the time and saw the incident take place to please get in contact as soon as possible. We know the area was very busy at the time of the offence, so it is likely many people saw the attack.

"We have spoken to a couple of people who saw what happened, we'd like to speak to them again and particularly anyone who has not yet spoken to us. Any information you provide could help us to find those responsible for this crime."

Anyone with information is asked to contact North Herts Local Crime Unit via the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference G1/17/3992. You can also report information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report
