Police are appealing for information and witnesses following an assault in Stevenage.

At around 7pm on Thursday, October 18, the victim - a 17 year old boy - was walking with three friends in the new underpass near Asda, which leads to Cash Converters in the town centre, when he was assaulted by a group of people.

The offenders - believed to be four males and two females - punched the victim before running off along St Georges Way.

PC Anthony Martin, who is investigating, said: "I'm appealing for anyone who saw the incident to come forward as you may have information that could help us to identify the offenders."

Anyone with information is asked to contact PC Martin by emailing anthony.martin@herts.pnn.police.uk, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/47689/18 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/report.

Alternatively, if you'd rather provide information anonymously contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
