The victim of a keyless car theft in Borehamwood has written to the Chief Constable thanking police for their quick response in locating and returning his vehicle to him.

A new Mercedes Benz C Class was stolen from a driveway in the Brook Meadow area between 3.15am and 3.20am on Thursday May 3. The owner quickly contacted police and within a few minutes, his car was recovered.

Rokas Urbouaricius, aged 21, of Old Church Gardens in Romford, was stopped on the M25 between junction 27 and 28 on May 3 and arrested on suspicious of conspiracy to steal a vehicle. He has been remanded in custody and is due to appear at St Albans Crown Court on Friday June 1.

The owner said: "The way your team responded and treated us was excellent! The car itself was recovered within about half an hour and from the time of calling, a police officer was at our house within five to 10 minutes. Not only did you recover our car without any damage, but your team were supportive, very knowledgeable, put us at ease and kept us informed at all stages."
