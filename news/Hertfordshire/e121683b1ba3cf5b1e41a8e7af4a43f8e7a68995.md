Police are re-appealing to members of the public to help trace a man who is wanted.

Talha Ahmed, who is 21 years old and of no fixed address, is wanted on recall to prison.

He is also wanted in connection with the following crimes which all took place in Hertfordshire last year:

 * The theft of a black Mercedes in Southdown Road, Hatfield on Monday, October 23,
 * The theft of a grey Mercedes in Dacre Gardens, Borehamwood on Thursday, December 14
 * The theft of a silver Mercedes in Moss Road, Watford on Thursday, December 21
 * The theft of a blue Volkswagen Golf in Allen Close, Radlett on Saturday, December 23

Talha has links to Hertfordshire, Essex and London - in particular, Romford, Ilford and Plaistow.

Anyone who has seen him or knows of his whereabouts is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/report.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
