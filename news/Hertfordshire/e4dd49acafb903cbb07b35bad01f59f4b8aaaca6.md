Police in East Herts are appealing for help to identify someone they would like to speak to in connection with a series of thefts from gym changing rooms.

The offences were committed on October 19, between 6.30pm and 8pm, at gyms across Bishop's Stortford.

Officers would like to speak to the person on the CCTV as they believe he could have information which will help their investigation.

Anyone who recognises the male pictured or has any other information about the incident is asked to contact PCSO Natasha Coppin via the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/47963/18. You can also report information online.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
