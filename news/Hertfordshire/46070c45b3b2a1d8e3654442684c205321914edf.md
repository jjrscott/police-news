Officers in Stevenage have been given authorisation to stop and search members of the public suspected to be carrying knives from 11pm on Friday, March 22 until 8am on Saturday, March 23, under Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.

The Section 60 applies to the whole of Stevenage and means anyone in the town may be searched for weapons without the police officer having reasonable grounds for each person searched.

Inspector Patrick McPeake said: "Following concerns from residents tonight (March 22), the Section 60 powers are being used to target people we believe to be involved in criminality and are a way for us to disrupt crime and keep the public safe.

"There are serious consequences if you choose to carry a knife. Not only will you face a possible custodial sentence and criminal record, which could affect your job prospects in later life, you could cause yourself or another person serious injury or even death."

A section 60 temporarily gives additional powers to police officers, which allow them to stop and search anyone in a particular area for a set period of time without the officers requiring reasonable grounds to do so. They are different to the stop and search powers they already have, which can be used at any time and - when used - do require reasonable grounds. Under the Home Office's best use of stop and search scheme we will, where practicable, publicise section 60s to the public.
