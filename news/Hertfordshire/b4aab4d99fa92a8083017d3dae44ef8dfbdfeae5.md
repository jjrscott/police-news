* ### Bushey and Radlett Safer Neighbourhood Team hold burglary crime prevention events

 * ### Make your house secure this autumn

 * ### Call police if you witness suspicious activity

With burglary offences traditionally increasing at this time of the year, the Bushey and Radlett Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT) is asking residents to get one step ahead of criminals by joining them for crime prevention events in Radlett.

With the clocks going back at the weekend, the afternoons will grow darker. Homes that are left unlit during the dark afternoons act as a signal to burglars that a home is empty, so the team will be sharing vital tips such as leaving a lamp on to give your home the lived-in look.

An event was held on Wednesday (21 October) in Hilfield Lane and the SNT will be holding two further events:

 * Letchmore Heath, Back Lane, Radlett on Wednesday 28 October between 10am and 3pm
 * Phillimore Recreation Ground, Radlett on Monday 9 November between 10am and 3pm

Just this week a burglary was reported in Radlett. At 5.30pm on Monday (19 October) three men gained access to a house in Battlers Green Drive through an insecure conservatory door. They made off before any items were stolen. (41/84268/20)

PCSO Milan Boca said: "Whilst we're expecting fewer burglaries this year due to more people working from home, criminals will still be seeking unoccupied homes which is why it is so vital to do all you can to protect your valuables.

"We see all too often the devastating impact of a burglary, not only is it a loss of valuable items but you feel like your privacy has been invaded. If you give your home a lived-in look by using a timer switch to turn on a light, radio or TV when it gets dark then criminals are more likely to avoid your home. It's so easy, yet so effective.

"We'd love for people to come and join us. Not only will we be giving advice, you can also come and talk to us about any policing issues that are affecting your quality of life."

Residents can make their homes more secure by following some basic crime prevention advice such as:

 * Lock all doors and windows and ensure any PVCu doors are locked properly by lifting the handle and using the key to double-lock them ** **
 * Consider installing a door bell camera, internal camera and/or monitored burglar alarm
 * Install 'dusk to dawn' external lighting and use timer switches in your home to control internal lights, radios and a simulated TV
 * Keep keys and valuables secure and out of sight
 * Ensure boundary fences are secure with side gates locked. Keep tools and ladders in a locked shed

 * Secure bins at night and put garden furniture away for the winter as these can be used by burglars as climbing aids to gain access to upper floor windows
 * Ensure your vehicle is locked and remove all valuables as burglars often check to see if doors are left unlocked
