Officers investigating a theft from a shop in London Colney have released an image of a person they would like to speak to as part of their enquiries.

It happened at the A1 convenience store on Haseldine Road just after 9.50pm on Friday, October 5.

A member of staff, a man in his 40s, was cleaning the shop floor prior to closing when the offender entered the shop and stole the till before leaving in the direction of Manor Road.

PC Steve Whittaker, who is investigating, said: "We appreciate that you cannot see this person's face clearly however, they are wearing a distinctive jumper which says 'Yale' on the front which we hope someone may recognise.

"We are very keen to identify them and speak to them, as we believe they may have information that could greatly assist our investigation.

"If you were in the area at the time, do you remember seeing anyone running from the scene? If so, we would like to hear from you.
