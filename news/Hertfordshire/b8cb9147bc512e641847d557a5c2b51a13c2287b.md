Police are appealing for information and witnesses following a serious road traffic collision involving a car and a pedestrian in Watford.

Just before 5pm today (Tuesday) a pedestrian - a woman aged in her 80s - was involved in a collision with a dark blue Fiat 500 in Oxhey Road. The collision happened close to the junction with Eastbury Road.

The pedestrian has been taken to hospital by ambulance with serious injuries. Officers remain at the scene and the road is currently closed.

Sergeant Sam Cordingley from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit said: "This collision happened during rush hour and I believe that a number of motorists would have been queuing at nearby traffic lights and may have seen what happened.

"I'm appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed the collision to get in touch as soon as possible. I'd also urge anyone who has a dash cam and was in the area to check your footage and contact me if there is anything that could help our enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via 101, quoting ISR 552 of November 27 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/report.

Alternatively, if you'd rather provide information anonymously contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
