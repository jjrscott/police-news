Police are appealing for information and witnesses following an incident of alleged assault in Hemel Hempstead.

At around 7.30pm on Sunday, October 21, the victim - a woman aged in her 40s - was reportedly verbally abused and assaulted by a man known to her near the traffic lights outside Dunelm in London Road, Apsley.

Detective Sergeant Andrea Dalton, who is investigating, said: "I'm appealing for anyone who believes they saw this incident to get in touch as you may have information that could be vital to our investigation."

Anyone who has information is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary by emailing DS Dalton at _andrea.dalton@herts.pnn.police.uk_ , calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/48618/18 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
