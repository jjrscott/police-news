Three teenagers have been charged in connection with a number of robberies which are alleged to have occurred in Watford.

The teenagers, one aged 14 and two aged 15, who cannot be named for legal reasons, have each been charged in connection with six offences which reportedly took place between December 4, 2018 and January 5, 2019.

All three appeared before remand court yesterday (Tuesday, January 8) where they were released on conditional bail pending their next hearing at Central Herts Youth Court on January 16.

Watford Chief Inspector Matt Phillips said: "While we do not have a robbery problem in Watford, I fully understand that incidents of this nature can cause concern in the community. We take all reports seriously and will do whatever we can to support our victims and bring offenders to justice." **
