Officers from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit are appealing for witnesses and information following a serious road traffic collision in Borehamwood earlier today (January 30).

At around 4.55pm a red Land Rover Freelander was in collision with a pedestrian in Arundel Road.

The driver of the vehicle was uninjured.

Police remain at the scene and the road is closed whilst the incident is investigated.

Officers would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision, or the events prior to it. Additionally, police would ask anyone in the area at the time to review their dash cam footage if they have a camera installed in their vehicle.
