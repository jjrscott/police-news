Drivers and pedestrians have been put at risk recently from people riding mopeds and motorcycles recklessly in Broxbourne.

Following on from several incidents of people riding two wheeled vehicles dangerously in the borough over recent months, a 16 year old boy from Cheshunt was arrested on Friday May 25 on suspicion of dangerous driving.

Broxbourne Chief Inspector Ian Butler said: "These riders are showing a complete disregard for the public's safety. Their behaviour has been shocking and extremely dangerous. We have already arrested several people for related offences and we will be continuing to target those putting other road users and pedestrians in danger. We believe many of these incidents have involved teenagers and I would urge parents to check what their teenage children are getting up to, make sure they ride safely and report crime and anti-social behaviour to us. We will do everything we can to track down these offenders, deploying extra officers and road policing units to help keep residents in Broxbourne safe."
