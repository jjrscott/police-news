Officers investigating a road rage incident where the offender made verbal threats to the victim are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 12.15pm on Tuesday, August 28, the male driver of a dark grey Kia Sportage threatened a motorist - a man aged in his 50s - following a minor road disagreement at a roundabout in Bridge Road.

Following the disagreement the victim parked his car in the B&Q car park in Swallowfields and got out to run an errand.

The offender then approached the victim's parked car and began taking pictures of the vehicle. The victim questioned the offender who then threatened him before running off.

PCSO Daniel Hill from the Welwyn Hatfield Safer Neighbourhood Team said: "We know that the driver of a black Astra witnessed the incident and stopped to ask the victim if he was OK and we're keen to speak to this person as they may have further information that may help us to identify the man."

Anyone who saw the dispute at the roundabout or the subsequent incident is asked to contact PCSO Hill by emailing daniel.hill@herts.pnn.police.uk, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/31691/18 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
