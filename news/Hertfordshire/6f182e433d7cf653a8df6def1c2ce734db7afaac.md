Officers investigating two reports of racially aggravated harassment and a report of racially aggravated assault in Letchworth Garden City are appealing for anyone with information to get in contact.

The first incident occurred at around 1.45pm on Wednesday, March 20, when a woman was walking along Pixmore Avenue and a man, who was with two other white men, approached her.

He said "go back where you came from", while the victim continued walking.

The second incident took place at around 7.05pm on Saturday, March 23, when the same woman was walking along Pixmore Avenue and turned onto Ridge Road, and was then suddenly shoved from behind forcing her to jolt forwards.

She turned around and saw two men, one of which said "why don't you go back where you came from? We don't want you here."

The victim left the area and phoned police.

It is believed to be the same offender in both incidents, who is described as white, of medium build and aged around 20.

Any witnesses or anyone with information should contact PC Joe Massey on joe.massey@herts.pnn.police.uk or the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/26989/19. You can also report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.

**Reporting hate crime **

Hate crimes are crimes like any other, but that have the added distinction that the victim was targeted because of their disability, race, religion, sexual orientation or transgender identity.

Victims and witnesses can report incidents to police without fear via the non-emergency number 101, online at www.herts.police.uk/Report or 999 if a crime is on-going. Victims can be reassured that they will be taken seriously and treated with sensitivity.
