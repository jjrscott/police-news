* ### Did you witness incident in Stevenage?

 * ### Two men sustained stab injuries

 * ### Extra police patrolling as enquiries continue

Police investigating an incident in Stevenage last night (Thursday 7 November) are appealing for witnesses.

Officers were called to the Bedwell area at 8.56pm to reports that two men had sustained stab wounds.

A 19 year old man and a 57 year old man - who both live locally - were taken to hospital by ambulance. The older man was released and the other remains in hospital in a stable condition.

Investigating officer, Inspector Graeme Walsingham, of the Stevenage Local Crime Unit, said: "I would like to take this opportunity to reassure the community that those involved are believed to be known to each other, and as such there is no further threat to the public."

He said extra police officers will be patrolling in the area as enquiries continue and asked for anyone with any information to call the non-emergency number 101, quoting ISR 714 of November 7.

Insp Walsingham added: "In response to this incident, a Section 60 stop and search operation was authorised in Stevenage, between 12.01am and 7am. This temporarily gives additional powers to police officers, allowing them to stop and search a particular area for a set period of time, without requiring reasonable grounds to do so."

The following areas were covered:

 * Gunnels Wood Road
 * Hitchin Road
 * Coreys Mill Lane
 * North Road
 * Martins Way
 * Verity Way
 * Fairlands Way
 * Gresley Way
 * Broadhall Way
