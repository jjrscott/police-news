Police are appealing for information and witnesses after thieves attempted to steal a catalytic converter from a parked car in Baldock.

Between 2pm - 3.45pm on Friday, October 26, three men got out of a dark coloured SAAB 93 car and approached a black Honda Accord that was parked on the High Street near Mansfield Road. They tried to cut off the Honda's catalytic converter.

PC Shaun Deal, who is investigating, said: "I'd like to speak to any motorists who used the High Street between 2pm and 2.30pm on that day and who may have dash cam footage that would help our investigation.

"If you can help, please get in touch via the non-emergency number 101 or email me, quoting crime reference 41/50329/18. You can also report information online."

 Alternatively, contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
