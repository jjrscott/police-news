Police are appealing for information and witnesses following a burglary in Hemel Hempstead.

Just before 1.30am on Friday, May 17, offenders gained access to an apartment in Cotterells and searched inside.

The men were disturbed by the occupant and they subsequently left. The occupant was not harmed and nothing was taken from inside the property.

Detective Constable Chris Phillips, who is investigating, said: "I'm appealing for anyone who was in the Cotterells area in the early hours of Friday, May 17 and believes they saw men acting suspiciously to please get in touch.

"If your vehicle was parked in the road and you have a dash cam fitted please check to see if it recorded anything that could help our investigation."

Anyone with information can contact DC Phillips by emailing chris.phillips@herts.pnn.police.uk, report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report, speak to an operator in our Force Communications Room via our online web chat, which can be launched here: herts.police.uk/contact or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/44051/19.
