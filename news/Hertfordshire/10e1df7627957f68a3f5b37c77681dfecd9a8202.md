Officers investigating a burglary in Borehamwood are releasing photos of stolen jewellery in a bid to trace it.

Sometime between 1.30pm and 3pm on Monday, April 15, a property in Wentworth Avenue was broken into and a number of items of jewellery and foreign currency were stolen.

Offender(s) gained entry by smashing a back patio door before conducting an untidy search and stealing a safe containing the items.

Detective Constable Stuart Keene, who is investigating, said: "I am appealing for anybody who saw anything suspicious between the times stated to get in touch, particularly if you recall seeing a black Volkswagen Passat in the area. Similarly, if you believe that you may have been offered one of these items for sale, please get in contact with me. You may have vital information that could help our investigation and reunite the victims with their jewellery which is of great sentimental value to them.

"If you can help, please get in touch on the non-emergency number 101 or email me at stuart.keene@herts.pnn.police.uk, quoting crime reference 41/34225/19. You can also report information online at www.herts.police.uk/report."

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
