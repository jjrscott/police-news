* ### Don't let thieves ruin your Christmas - secure your home.

 * ### Keep presents in a secure place not in the car or outbuildings or on view.

 * ### Security mark and register valuables for free at www.immobilise.com.

Hertfordshire Constabulary would like to wish all residents in the county a merry, crime-free Christmas.

During December police are reminding residents to keep their homes and valuables secure by following some simple crime prevention tips to make sure everyone enjoys a wonderful Christmas.

Inspector Nicola Dean, from the Crime Reduction Unit, said: "The weeks leading up to Christmas are a busy time of year for everyone, including criminals. At this time of year thieves know that homes are full of gifts and will be on the lookout for opportunities to steal them. Leaving gifts in outbuildings or in cars makes them more accessible to thieves. If you leave valuables on view either at home or in the car, a thief may be tempted."

 * Make sure you keep all your gifts in a secure place - don't leave them in the shed or garage, or on view near windows or doors.
 * Don't leave bags, purses or other valuables on view in your car.
 * Lock up when you leave - make sure all windows and doors are securely locked when you leave the house or go up to bed.
 * Security mark valuables and register them for free on www.immobilise.com.
 * Security marking and registering your children's Christmas gifts will help to keep them safe and get them returned if they are lost or stolen.
 * When out shopping push your purse to the bottom of your bag and zip it securely, wallets should not be carried in back pockets.
 * Consider installing a door bell camera, internal camera and/or monitored burglar alarm.
 * Install 'dusk to dawn' external lighting and use timer switches in your home to control internal lights, radios and a simulated TV.
 * Visit www.owlprotect.uk for discounts on security products.
