The family of a woman who died in a collision in Queensway, Hemel Hempstead, have paid tribute to the 'life and soul' of their hearts.

Natalie Hastings, aged 41, from Hemel Hempstead, was involved in a collision with a grey Volvo on Monday, January 15. She sadly passed away in hospital yesterday morning as a result of her injuries.

In a statement, Natalie's family have said: "Natalie was a beautiful soul with a big, big heart, taken far too soon.

"To the world she was like sunshine on a rainy day. She was the life and soul of our hearts.

"The sun won't shine so bright anymore without her in the world. She was an amazing daughter, sister, aunty and granddaughter.

"To the girl that always put others first, you'll be missed eternally but your memory will always live on. We love you always and forever, your family."

The family have asked for their privacy to be respected at this difficult time.

 * Simon Whittle, aged 48, of Fletcher Way, Hemel Hempstead, has been charged with murder and appeared at Hatfield Remand Court today. He has been remanded and will next appear at St Albans Crown Court on Friday, January 19. He has also been charged with assaulting a police officer and criminal damage to police property.
