Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a man who is wanted.

He also has connections with the North Herts area.

Anyone who has seen Nyle or knows of his whereabouts is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101, quoting investigation number 41/40720/19 or report information online.
