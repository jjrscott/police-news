A man has been arrested in Hatfield on suspicion of possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply.

The 21 year old man, from London, was stopped by police in Bishop's Square at around 10.45am yesterday morning (Thursday, May 23).

One hundred and seventeen wraps of suspected crack have been seized by police, along with a further 69 wraps of suspected heroin.

The man has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Detective Inspector Rob Burns, from the Welwyn Hatfield Local Crime Unit, said: "I am glad that a significant amount of suspected Class A drugs are now off the streets of Hatfield. Drug-taking often goes hand-in-hand with other criminality, such as residential burglary, as users try to feed their habits.

"I hope this arrest reassures residents that we will do all we can to tackle drug crime in Welwyn Hatfield."
