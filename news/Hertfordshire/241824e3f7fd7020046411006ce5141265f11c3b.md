Police are appealing for the public's help to identify a man they would like to speak to in connection with their enquiries into an office burglary in Bushey.

At around 3.05pm on Monday, April 15, a coral-coloured iPhone XR was stolen from a receptionist's desk at an office in Sparrows Herne. The offender distracted a staff member by waving around a piece of pink paper, using a copier machine and talking about a hair salon. He was seen driving away in a black VW Passat.

Officers would like to speak to the man pictured as he may have information which could assist the investigation.

Any witnesses or anyone with information should contact PC Gerard Handscombe by email or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/34150/19. You can also report information online

Alternatively, you can stay 100 per cent anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form.
