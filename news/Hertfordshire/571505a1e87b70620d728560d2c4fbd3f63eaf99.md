Police in East Herts are appealing for witnesses and information following the theft of a cement mixer in Ware.

Between 1pm on Saturday, September 30th and 1.30pm on Monday October 2, a bright orange mixer with 'Hire Station' written all over it, was taken from the development site next to Ware College.

"Offenders have gained access to the site through the wire fencing," explained investigating officer Dean Watson. "I am appealing to anyone who was in that area at the time and may have witnessed any suspicious activity, to get in touch."

Anyone who thinks they can help is asked to contact PC Dean Watson on 101 quoting crime reference number A1/17/3271.
