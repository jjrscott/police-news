Officers investigating a robbery in Letchworth are appealing for information and witnesses.

At around 5.30pm on Thursday, April 11, the victim - a 12 year old boy - was cycling along Norton Common near Norton Way North when he was approached by a teenage boy.

He asked for the victim's mountain bike before pulling him off it. He then stole the bike and cycled away on it.

The offender is described as white and aged 14 to 15 years old. He was wearing a grey hoody and black trousers.

Detective Sergeant Karen Lewis, from the North Herts Local Crime Unit, said: "The victim was not injured but he was understandably shaken up. I am appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time and saw what happened to please get in touch.

"Similarly if you think you have seen the bike or been offered it for sale please let us know. It's a black Carrera Vengeance with white writing on it.

"If you can help, please call the non-emergency number 101 quoting crime reference 41/33083/19."
