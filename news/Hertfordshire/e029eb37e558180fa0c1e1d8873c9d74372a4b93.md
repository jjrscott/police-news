Officers investigating a burglary in Waltham Cross are appealing for witnesses who may have any information.

The incident took place in Station Road, at the Lea Valley Towpath, where the victim returned home to find that his houseboat had been broken into. The burglary is believed to have taken place between the dates of Saturday 17 August and Tuesday 20 August.

A search was carried out, and a large number of items were found to be missing. This includes a distinctive bike and trailer which were secured outside of the boat, as well as other items missing from inside the boat. There was significant damage caused by forced entry.

Detective Constable Claire Sprent, from the Local Crime Unit, said: "If you were in the area and saw any suspicious activity, or believe that you witnessed the incident taking place, please get in touch."

You can report information online, speak to an operator in our Force Communications Room via our online web chat or call the non-mergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/75640/19.
