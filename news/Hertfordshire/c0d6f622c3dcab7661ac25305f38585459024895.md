Officers investigating a theft in Stevenage are releasing a photo of a man they would like to speak to who may be able to assist with their enquiries.

At around 7.25am on Sunday, March 24, a man walked into the One Stop store on Broadwater Crescent, selected chocolate and put it in his pockets before approaching the till and taking a blue Marie Curie charity box.

The charity box was found ripped open and empty a short distance away from the store.

Officers would like to speak with the man pictured as he may have information which could assist the investigation.

PC Stuart Smith from the Stevenage Intervention Team said: "These funds stolen have been taken away from a charity that supports people with terminal illnesses and their families. This type of crime will not be tolerated in Hertfordshire and is taken seriously.

"Please help us protect people's donations by keeping an eye out for anyone acting suspiciously around charity boxes and if you are displaying a charity box, make sure it is secure, and preferably covered by CCTV."

Any witnesses or anyone with information should contact PC Smith on stuart.smith@herts.pnn.police.uk or the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/27104/19. You can also report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
