Officers investigating an assault in Watford are appealing for witnesses and information.

The incident occurred at around 7.30pm on Friday, March 29, when the victim was riding a bicycle on the Ashfields bridge over the A41 and a man pushed him, knocking him off and grabbing the bike. The man then dropped the bike and left the area on foot, heading towards Courtlands Drive.

The man was described as white, around 50-60 years old with grey hair and was wearing a dark blue fleece.

Police Constable Jonathan Lister from the Watford Safer Neighbourhood Team, who is investigating, said: "This was an unprovoked attack which left the victim shaken but thankfully not badly injured. I would ask anyone who witnessed this incident to please email me on _jonathan.lister@herts.pnn.police.uk_ or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/28954/19."
