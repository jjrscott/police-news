Officers are appealing to trace the owner of a bicycle which had its wheels stolen while it was locked to a lamppost in St Albans.

At 10.30pm on Thursday, March 14, a man removed the wheels from a white men's mountain bike which was locked to a lamppost on Civic Close outside Waterend Barn public house.

CCTV showed another man later returned to the bike, examined it before unlocking it and carrying it away.

Police Constable Lee Hammond, from the St Albans Intervention Team, said: "We are keen to identify the victim so that we can progress this investigation.

"We also ask any witnesses of the theft to please come forward.

"If you are the owner of this bicycle, please email me or phone Hertfordshire Constabulary on the non-emergency number 101."
