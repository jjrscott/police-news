Police in Watford are releasing images of suspected stolen property in the hopes of reuniting the items with their rightful owners.

The property was recovered by officers in Watford High Street on Friday, September 28.

Detective Sergeant Helen Cox said: "Despite our enquiries, we have been unable to trace the rightful owners of these items so far. I am appealing for anyone who recognises them to please get in touch. Not only could we return your property to you, you may also have vital information that could assist us in our ongoing investigation."

Anyone who thinks they may know who the items belong is asked to email or call the non-emergency number 101. You can also report information online.
