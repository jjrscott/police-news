Officers investigating a burglary in Rickmansworth are appealing for anyone with information to get in contact.

Sometime between 6.30pm and 10.50pm on Wednesday, January 23, a property in Tudor Way was broken into and an untidy search was conducted.

A safe was stolen which contained a large number of coins, including 1,000 2013 1oz silver Britannia coins and 85 1oz Canadian silver Maple coins.

The offender(s) entered the property from a neighbour's address and have gained entry to the house by smashing a back door with an axe.

The offender(s) exited the property via the back door and made off down a side alley, and it is believed they concealed the safe in a duvet stolen from the property.
