Two men have been sentenced at St Albans Crown Court after being found in possession of half a kilo of cocaine worth Â£30,000.

Jack McGrath, aged 20, of Norfolk Gardens in Borehamwood and Saachicco Williamson, aged 25, of Lammas Mead in Hitchin were stopped by officers on May 2, 2017, as they were driving along Bedford Road between Henlow and Hitchin, as part of an ongoing investigation into drug related crime in the area.

Officers searched both men and their vehicle and found a carrier bag containing the sizeable amount of cocaine in a foot-well in the car.

Williamson and McGrath were subsequently charged with possession with intent to supply a Class A drug - cocaine. Both men were convicted and, on February 19, received prison sentences of five years and four months (Williamson) and four years and four months (McGrath).

Detective Sergeant Sarah Gilbertson, from the Hitchin Local Crime Unit, said: "These two young men have both received substantial custodial sentences that was only possible as a result of excellent investigative work carried out by my team.

"It should stand as a warning to anyone aspiring to get involved in organised crime, especially the supply of Class A drugs. If, like McGrath and Williamson, you're involved in such criminality, you will be identified, you will be prosecuted and you will go to prison."
