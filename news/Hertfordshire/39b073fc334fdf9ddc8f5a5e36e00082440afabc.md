More than 65 bicycles, which are suspected to have been stolen, were recovered during a warrant in Hertford on Tuesday (4 August).

Officers from the East Herts Scorpion team carried out the operation at an address in Mead Lane, after intelligence was received about the handling of stolen goods.

Detective Inspector Ben Freeman, who oversees the local Scorpion team, said: "This was an excellent result and we're hopeful we can reunite these bikes with their rightful owners in due course.

"Enquiries are continuing at this time to establish how the bikes came to be at the address."

A man was arrested following the warrant and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
