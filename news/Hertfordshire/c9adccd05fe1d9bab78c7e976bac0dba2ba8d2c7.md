Officers are appealing for witnesses and information following a burglary in Royston.

On Wednesday 30 September, at around 10.30pm, a large quantity of tobacco was stolen from McColl's on Queens Road.

Significant damage was caused to the exterior of the premises to allow the offenders to gain entry.

The suspects have been described as two white males, and it was reported that they left the scene in a light-coloured estate style vehicle in the direction of Tesco Extra.

DC Benjamin Stacey, who is investigating, said: "We have already conducted extensive enquiries and identified several witnesses, but we believe there may be other people who witnessed the burglary taking place or the events leading up to or following it, who have not yet spoken to police.

"I would like to appeal to anyone who may have any information to get in touch with me as soon as they can. Even something that may seem minor or relatively insignificant could be key to our investigation."

Anyone with information can contact DC Stacey directly via email.
