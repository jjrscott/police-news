Officers have released a photo of a man who might be able to help with their enquiries into an incident of voyeurism in Welwyn Garden City.

At around 5.10pm on Thursday 10 October, the victim - a 17 year old boy, was in a men's toilet cubicle in the Howard Centre when he noticed the offender leaning over from the next cubicle and filming him.

The victim challenged the offender who then made off.

PC Warren Potter, who is investigating, said: "This was a sickening act which understandably left the victim feeling very shaken.

"We believe that the man pictured may have been in the area at the time and he could have vital information that will help our investigation.

"If you recognise him, or have other information about what happened, please get in touch by calling the non-emergency number 101 or email quoting crime reference 41/92218/19."

You can report information online, speak to an operator in our Force Communications Room via our online web chat or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/92218/19.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form
