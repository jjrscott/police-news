Police are appealing for information and witnesses following an incident of assault in Watford.

At around 8.20am on Friday, October 5, the victim - a man aged in his 30s - was involved in a verbal altercation with a man at the Shell Petrol Station in St Albans Road.

The man then made a racial comment before punching and pushing the victim causing him to suffer cuts to his lips and nose and a graze on his knee.

PC Darren Lomax, who is investigating, said: "There were a number of people at the petrol station at the time of the incident and I would like to speak to anyone who saw what happened.

"In particular, I would like to speak to a man who was driving a black BMW 3 Series and a man driving a black Toyota Prius, as I believe you may have information that can help our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact PC Lomax by emailing, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/43340/18 or report information online.

Alternatively, contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
