Police are appealing for witnesses and information after a large climbing frame in a Watford rec was set alight.

Sometime between 4am and 4.30am on Tuesday 28 May, offenders have set light to paper at the top of the climbing frame in Waterfields Recreation Ground, on Shaftesbury Road. The fire has spread to the frame causing extensive damage which will take some time to repair.

PC George Lewin, investigating, said: "This was a mindless act of destruction that has resulted in Â£10,000-worth of damage to a public amenity. I would like to reassure residents we are doing all we can to trace the individuals responsible.

"Did you see anyone acting suspiciously in the area at the time? If so I would like to speak to you as soon as possible."

*Two boys aged 15 and 16 have been arrested on suspicion of arson not endangering life. They have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Any witnesses or anyone with information should contact PC Lewin on _george.lewin@herts.pnn.police.uk_ or the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/47673/19. You can also report information online at www.herts.police.uk/report

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
