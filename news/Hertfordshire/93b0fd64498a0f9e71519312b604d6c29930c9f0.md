Police are appealing to the public for their help in locating a wanted man.

Ben Davey, aged 30, whose last known address is in Hemel Hempstead, is wanted in connection with a common assault which is alleged to have happened on Saturday 30 November, and for breaching his court bail conditions.

Anyone who sees him, or has any information about his whereabouts, is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via 101 or report information online quoting crime reference _41/107771/19._

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form.
