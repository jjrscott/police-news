Officers have released a CCTV image of two women who might be able to help with their enquiries following a theft in Watford.

The incident happened in H&M in the Intu Centre on Thursday 17 October.

At around 1pm, a woman in her sixties was shopping when her purse was stolen from her bag.

PC Mark Emerson, who is investigating, said: "Extensive enquiries have been carried out to trace the offender(s) and I am now asking for the public's help.

"We believe the women pictured may have been in the shop at the time and could have vital information that will help the investigation.

"If you recognise them or have other information about what happened, please call the non-emergency number 101 or email quoting crime reference 41/94618/19."

You can also report information online or speak to an operator in our Force Communications Room via our online web chat.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form.
