Police investigating a theft, in which an elderly woman was targeted, are releasing images (see below) of three people they would like to speak with as part of their investigation.

At around 11.40am on Thursday, February 14 a woman in her 80s had been shopping in Sainsbury's in Brewery Road, Hoddesdon and was walking towards her car when she was stopped by a man and a woman.

The pair asked the woman for directions to a hospital. Whilst she was distracted, her credit card was stolen.

The card was subsequently used to purchase three iPhone Xs at a cost of almost Â£4,000.

It's believed the two men and woman pictured will be able to assist officers with their investigation and they are urged to make contact with police.

Additionally, anyone who recognises them, or has any other information should contact PCSO Louise Roberts on _louise.roberts@herts.pnn.police.uk_ or the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/14774/19. You can also report information online at herts.police.uk/Report
