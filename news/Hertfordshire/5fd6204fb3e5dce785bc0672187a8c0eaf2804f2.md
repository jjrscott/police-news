Police are trying to find the rightful owner of a brand new lawn mower which was found in undergrowth in The Wick in St Albans recently.

The new Honda MTD Optima petrol lawn mower is worth about Â£500.

PCSO Adriano Russo said: "Strangely, we haven't had any reported thefts of this type of lawn mower. However, it is possible the owner does not realise it is missing. We would love to reunite it with its rightful owner."

It was found by a member of the public on Saturday January 27.

If you believe it is yours, please contact police on 101 quoting 0425 of January 27, 2018.
