A free tool marking event is to take place in Tring tomorrow (Saturday, September 15) to help people keep their belongings more secure.

Engraving or marking your tools makes them less attractive to thieves as they are harder to sell on. It also makes it easier to return items if they are ever lost or stolen and later recovered by police.

Officers will be marking tools at Tring police station, in the High Street, between 10am and 2pm.

PCSO Tommy Walter, from the Berkhamsted and Tring Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "The theft of tools can have a huge impact on people's livelihoods so we want to do all we can to help them keep their valuables more secure. It only takes a few minutes and there is no need to make an appointment, just pop along on the day. We will also be giving out crime prevention advice on a range of other topics."

The tool marking scheme was launched in Dacorum in January 2017 and has seen officers engrave hundreds of tools, working with local businesses and organisations to promote the service.
