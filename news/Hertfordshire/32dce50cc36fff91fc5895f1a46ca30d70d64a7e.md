Detectives in Stevenage are appealing for witnesses and information to trace a man they believe could help with their inquiries into a burglary in the town.

On Saturday April 28, at around 7.15pm a man and a woman were discovered in a flat in the Old Town High Street. Upon being challenged by the owners they left the premises. The woman was detained by members of the public and arrested, however the man successfully made off.

Officers would like to speak to the man in the photo as they believe he was in the area at the time and could have information which could help their inquiry.

If you recognise this man or have any other information which could help the inquiry please contact DC Karen Dewar on 101 or online quoting crime reference number E1/18/3487.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.

 * Nazreen Younas aged 32 of no fixed address has been charged with burglary and has been remanded in custody until June 1.
