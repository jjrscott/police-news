Officers from the London Colney, St Stephen and St Albans East Safer Neighbourhood Team will be running a PL4TE S4FE event next week.

The event is being held outside **Sainsbury 's in London Colney** between **11am and 3pm on Friday May 4.**

Officers will be fitting tamperproof number plate screws free of charge, as well as offering crime prevention advice and signing people up to Neighbourhood Watch via OWL.

Residents can sign up to receive emails about crime and incidents in their local area, along with associated crime prevention advice by logging on to the OWL system at www.owl.co.uk.

_London Colney, St Stephen and St Albans East_ Sergeant Mark Williams, said: "Theft of car number plates can be hugely inconvenient and they can subsequently be used by criminals for offences such as bilking (stealing petrol) or evading speed camera fines. We're urging as many people as possible to come along to the event and get their plates secured. It only takes a few minutes and it's completely free."
