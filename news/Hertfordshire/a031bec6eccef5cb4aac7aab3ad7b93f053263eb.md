Those looking for fulfilling voluntary work are being encouraged to apply to Hertfordshire's Special Constabulary where successful applicants will be able to build new skills and strengths as they give back to the community.

A Special Constable is a part-time, voluntary police officer with all the same powers as regular police officers.

Specials come from all walks of life and volunteer their spare time for a minimum of 16 hours a month. They are highly trained and play an essential role in preventing, reducing and tackling crime and keeping the communities of Hertfordshire safe.

For many years, Hertfordshire Specials have been deployed in frontline policing teams, including:

 * Response (being dispatched by the control room to attend 999 calls)
 * Safer Neighbourhood Teams (fixing short- and long- term neighbourhood issues such as anti-social behaviour)
 * Road Policing Unit (patrolling the roads of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire responding to traffic offences and collisions)
 * Operational Support Unit (responsible for an array of capabilities including public order support)
 * Warrants and Bail (responsible for ensuring outstanding offenders are progressed through our systems and brought to justice effectively and efficiently)

Special Superintendent Tim Wade said: "If you're looking to give back to your community and are eager for new experiences and challenges, then becoming a Special Constable could be just the role for you. Not only will the new skills and strengths boost your CV, but you'll experience a real sense of fulfilment knowing that your hard work is helping to keep the people of Hertfordshire safe.

"Being a Special really is an experience like no other. As a Special you will work closely with regular police officers and there is opportunity for you to gain experience in specialisms such as rural policing and major crime which includes murder investigations and kidnaps. Just like regular police officers you'll be able to progress through the ranks to become Special Sergeants, Inspectors and so on. If you like the sound of this, we welcome your application to join us!"

Police and Crime Commissioner David Lloyd said: "Special Constables play a vital role in helping to tackle local priorities and it is a great way to give something back to your community. Our Specials not only support frontline roles but those with specialist skills also increase the Constabulary's capacity to tackle complex crimes such as cybercrime and domestic abuse.

"Much has been done to ensure the Special Constabulary are integrated within the existing police structure and that they receive the same training, protective uniform and perform the same role."
