Three teenagers are due to appear at court in connection with an alleged assault in South Oxhey.

The teenagers, two 14-year-old girls from South Oxhey and a 15-year-old boy from Rickmansworth, have been summoned to court via postal requisition.

They are scheduled to appear at St Albans Youth Court at 10am on Wednesday, June 19 for their first hearing.

The teenagers cannot be named publically as those under the age of 18 are granted automatic anonymity under Section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933.

Breaching this anonymity is a criminal offence for which you can be prosecuted.

Each teenager will answer a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH). No pleas have yet been entered.

The court appearances are in relation to an alleged assault in a children's playground off Henbury Way, on Sunday, March 3, where a 14-year-old girl sustained injuries.
