Officers have arrested three people in Welwyn Garden City on suspicion of drug dealing.

Following multiple reports of suspected drug dealing in Pollards Close, a 17 year old boy was stopped in the street by Operation Scorpion* on Friday 19 March at around 2pm. The 17 year old, who is from Luton, was arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply.

As a result of the arrest, a search was immediately carried out at a flat in Pollards Close. Inside the home, officers seized around 60 to 70 wraps of suspected class A drugs (crack and heroin) which were found in a laundry basket. Two women who were present during the search were also arrested on suspicion of possession of a class A drug with intent to supply. The women, both aged 31 and from Welwyn Garden City, have been released under investigation, along with the 17 year old, while further enquiries are carried out.
