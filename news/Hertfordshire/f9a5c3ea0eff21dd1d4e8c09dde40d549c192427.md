Following numerous reports of dangerous parking outside schools, East Herts Community Safety Partnership (CSP) has secured funding for a new initiative to help educate drivers.

As part of Operation Stomp, the partnership has purchased a number of 'parking buddies' which have been deployed outside primary schools across Bishop's Stortford this week.

The signs, which depict school children dressed in Mini Police uniform, were researched and chosen by East Herts Mini Police co-ordinator PCSO Tea Prow, who was successful in securing the funding bid. PCSO Prow came up with the idea following engagement sessions with Mini Police students, who had highlighted dangerous parking outside their schools as an issue.

Safer Neighbourhood Sergeant Mark Collins said: "So far the engagement between parents and police has been really positive. The parking buddies work really well to help keep children safe near schools and provoke a discussion. They are hard to ignore, being dressed as the Mini Police and if that makes drivers think about road safety, then they could help prevent injury to our young people."

So far, the figures have been utilised at Northgate Primary, Summercroft and Windhill21.
