 * ### A man has been arrested in connection with the investigation.

Police are appealing for the public's help to trace two men who are wanted.

Ali-Reza Masavi, aged 20, from Ashburnham Road in Luton, and Mohammed Amjad, aged 38, from Mildred Avenue in Watford, are wanted in connection with an alleged kidnap which occurred in Watford earlier this month.

Anyone with information on their whereabouts is asked to contact the Watford Local Crime Unit via non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/47822/18. You can also report information online.

If you believe you have seen them in the last few moments, call 999.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.

 * A 39-year-old man from Watford has been arrested and charged in connection with the investigation and is currently remanded in custody to appear at St Albans Crown Court on November 19.
