 An hour later, there was another fight, this time at Tesco in High Street at 7.05pm ~~~~ where a man suffered a broken arm.

 Detective Constable Claire Sprent, from the Cheshunt Local Crime Unit, said: "I understand that news of this incident may cause concern within the community, and I would like to reassure local residents that myself and my team are doing all we can to determine the circumstances around what happened.

 "I would appeal to any persons who witnessed this incident to come forward with information about what they saw. I would also appeal to any persons with dash cam passing this location, which may have caught this incident on their footage."

 Any witnesses or anyone with information should contact DC Sprent on claire.sprent@herts.pnn.police.uk or the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/52847/19. You can also report information online at www.herts.police.uk/report _._
