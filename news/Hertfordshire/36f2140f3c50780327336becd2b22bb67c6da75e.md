Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a woman who has gone missing from Hertford.

Alison Long, aged 55, was last seen in the Bengeo area at 7am on Tuesday, March 26.

She is described as white, 5ft 3in tall slim build with straight hair.

She also wears glasses.

Officers are growing increasingly concerned for Alison's welfare.

She may have travelled to Cornwall or the Isle of Wight. She also could have travelled to the Suffolk area where she contacted local housing shelters from Welwyn.

If you have seen Alison since she was reported missing or have information about where she has been, please contact Hertfordshire Constabulary as soon as possible quoting reference **ISR 572 of April 5**.

You can do this by reporting information online, speaking to an operator in the Force Communications Room via online web chat here

You can also call the non-emergency number 101.

If you believe you are with Alison now or have seen her in the last few moments, please call 999 immediately.
