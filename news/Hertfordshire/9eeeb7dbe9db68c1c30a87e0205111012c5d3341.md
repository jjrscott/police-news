Officers are appealing for information and witnesses following an assault in St Albans on Friday, October 5.

The incident happened at around 5.15pm in the recreation ground in Sherwood Avenue.

Following a verbal altercation, an 11 year old boy was slapped, causing a reddening to his cheek.

The offender is described as a white boy, aged around 15 to 16 years old with blond hair and he had an earring. He was wearing tracksuit/jogging bottoms and had a bag over his shoulder. He was also riding a bike with blue handlebars.

PC James Keene, who is investigating, said: "I am appealing for anyone who saw what happened to get in touch. The incident happened during a busy time in the park after school so there should hopefully be people who saw what happened.

"A member of the public stopped to help the victim but their identity is unknown at this time. I would like to appeal to this person to get in touch as you may be able to help with our enquiries.

"Anyone who can help should get in contact on the non-emergency number 101 or email james.keene2@herts.pnn.police.uk quoting crime reference 41/43395/18."
