We're recruiting volunteers to help us grow our Neighbourhood Watch scheme in Tring.

Tring's Safer Neighbourhood Team is looking for helpers to grow the OWL (Online Watch Link) membership. OWL is a free online messaging service which sends Neighbourhood Watch members email alerts about crimes in their area along with the latest crime prevention advice.

We're also appealing for Neighbourhood Watch street co-ordinators and volunteers to get involved with crime prevention events such as the Safer Streets Scheme and speed awareness initiatives.

If you're interested in volunteering please contact Philip Waine from the Constabulary's Community Safety Team by emailing philip.waine@herts.pnn.police.uk
