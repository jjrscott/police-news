At around 7am on Thursday, April 4, a 12-year-old girl was walking on High Avenue, at the junction with Unwin Close, when a man she was walking past grabbed her wrist. The victim managed to break free and ran away. Luckily she was uninjured.

The man is described as white, aged in his mid to early 30s, 5ft 8in tall, of slim build and with a slim face. He was wearing a hooded top and skinny fit jogging bottoms.
