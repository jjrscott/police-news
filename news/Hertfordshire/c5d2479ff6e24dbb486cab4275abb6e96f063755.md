Two men charged in connection with a collision in Stevenage, have appeared at St Albans Crown Court today (Wednesday 5 August).

The incident took place in Stevenage on Thursday 18 July 2019 and occurred after a car cruise meeting, which had been held in the town.

Officers attended Monkswood Way at around 9.45pm, to reports that two cars, which had reportedly been driven at speed in the area, had collided and subsequently hit crowds which had gathered to watch.

Dominic Brown, aged 21 and from Park Street Lane, St Albans, and 21-year-old Julian Castano-Perez from Fitzwalter Place, Dunmow in Essex, appeared at Stevenage Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 1 July, where they were charged with 19 offences in connection with the collision.

Both drivers are charged with nine offences of serious injury by dangerous driving and 10 offences for wanton/furious driving.

Today, both men pleaded not guilty to all charges. A case management hearing has now been set for 11 December.
