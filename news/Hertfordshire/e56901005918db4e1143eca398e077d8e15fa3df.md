Officers are re-appealing for witnesses and information following a fire that happened in Royston in the early hours of yesterday (Sunday, December 9).

Police were called by Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service shortly after 3.45am yesterday to advise they were responding to reports of a fire at St John the Baptist Church in Melbourn Street.

Initial enquiries suggested that the fire was a result of arson, however the cause of the fire is not yet known and is subject of an on-going investigation by officers and the Fire and Rescue Service.

Detective Inspector Mike Keane said: "Thankfully nobody was hurt during the incident but the church is of great significance to the local community.

"It is devastating to see damage caused to such a historic building and I would like to reassure the community that we are doing all we can, with assistance from our colleagues at Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service, to find out the cause of the fire in what is a difficult working environment.

"Anyone with information linked to this incident, or any witnesses, should get in touch with us on the non-emergency number 101, quoting ISR 143 of December 9.

"Any information you have, no matter how small it might seem, could prove to be significant to the investigation."
