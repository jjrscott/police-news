A new Closure Order has been secured on a property in Hertford after the local Safer Neighbourhood Team, East Herts Council and Sanctuary Housing took action against those involved in drug related crime.

The Closure Order was granted under the Anti-Social Behaviour Crime and Policing Act 2014 at St Albans Magistrates court on Monday, March 26 and bans anyone from entering the flat in Beane River View for three months. Should any unauthorised person enter the premises they will be arrested, which may result in imprisonment or a fine of up to Â£5000, or both.

The property was being investigated by police following complaints from local residents about people using the property in an anti-social manner, several reports of crime, drug dealing and people causing a disturbance.

Safer Neighbourhood Sergeant Michael Clark said **:** "The closure was sought following numerous complaints regarding the address from concerned residents who were affected by the behaviour of the occupants and their associates.

"By taking this action to fully close the address, we hope to provide neighbours with some respite from the on-going issues. We take reports like this very seriously and along with our partner agencies, have worked extremely hard to gather evidence to support the application."

"I would continue to urge members of the community to report any anti-social behaviour of this nature to the police."

Sharon Jones, Area Manager for Sanctuary Housing, commented: "Obtaining this Closure Order demonstrates the importance of working in partnership with the local police force and we're pleased that this will see the end of the anti-social behaviour issues the neighbours have been experiencing."
