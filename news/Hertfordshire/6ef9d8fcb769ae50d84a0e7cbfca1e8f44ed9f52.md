* ### Public invited to support new police service award.

 * ### Aimed at recognising outstanding contribution and dedication.

 * ### In three key areas - keeping people safe, reducing crime or catching criminals.

As part of a committed drive to work with the public in different ways to recognise and celebrate good service, the Constabulary is launching a new award.

Hoping to generate interest and community support, the new award has been created by Chief Constable Charlie Hall, QPM. It will form one of the special categories that are honoured at the Force's annual award ceremony which takes place this year in October.

"The Public's Award in Recognition for Commitment to policing" is aimed at either police officers or police staff who have been nominated by a member of the public in recognition of their outstanding contribution and dedication - keeping people safe, reducing crime or catching criminals.

Charlie explained: "I am hoping the public of Hertfordshire will really get behind us on this and to make the category as open as possible the areas of recognition are broad, falling into line with our wider force plan to keep people safe, reduce crime and help to catch criminals. If a member of the public has experienced great service in any of these three areas then I would urge them to nominate.

"Our service to the public is the heart of what we do as an organisation and I want this award to become a coveted prize in Hertfordshire Constabulary. Every day I see the great work of colleagues across the organisation and I know the public see that from a different perspective. I want to celebrate professionalism and dedication in this new way and share further good practice across the organisation."

Anyone who wants to nominate a Police Officer, PCSO, Special Constable or member of police staff can do so easily by emailing stating who they want to nominate and what that individual or team has done for them to make such a difference.

"By telling us what's important to you and how we can make a difference, I am hoping to bring some fresh thinking into the organisation as well as recognising the positive impact good service can have," added Charlie.
