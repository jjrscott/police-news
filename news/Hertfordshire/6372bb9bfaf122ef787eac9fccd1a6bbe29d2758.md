Officers arrested a man after a CCTV operator in St Albans spotted someone acting suspiciously outside the Oxfam bookshop in Catherine Street yesterday.

The operator was monitoring surveillance screens in the early hours of Wednesday 15 April when he noticed the suspect walking around the deserted streets.

A 45-year-old man was arrested in St Peter's Churchyard on suspicion of burglary at the Oxfam store. He was later released pending further investigation.

St Albans City and District Council has a CCTV system that covers the City Centre and other locations.
