Officers investigating a serious injury collision in Cuffley are appealing for information and witnesses.

It happened in Station Road at 3pm on Monday, September 3.

A blue Ford Fiesta was in collision with a bollard and a gas main before striking another vehicle.

The driver, a man in his 60s, suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital for further treatment, where he remains.

Sergeant Keith Evans, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit, said: "We are working to establish the circumstances that led to this collision and would like to speak to anyone who witnessed what happened, or who saw the Fiesta prior to or following the incident.

"If you have a dash cam fitted to your vehicle and were driving in the vicinity of Station Road at 3pm yesterday, we would be very keen to see any footage you may have."

Any witnesses or anyone with information should contact Sgt Evans on keith.evans@herts.pnn.police.uk or the non-emergency number 101, quoting ISR 442 of September 3. You can also report information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
