POLICE in Hertfordshire will take part in a week-long enforcement campaign from Monday (22 January) focused on raising awareness of the dangers caused by using a mobile phone whilst driving.

The campaign will encourage members of the public to #PutItDown while driving in order to combat a growing trend of mobile phone use behind the wheel.

Officers from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing unit will carrying out enforcement activity to support the campaign.

Last year in Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire, 2047 people were caught using a mobile phone while driving by the tri-force unit. Additionally in a recent poll, 24 per cent of people in Hertfordshire admitted to using a mobile phone to make a call, change music or text while driving.

Inspector Chris Huggins, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit, said: "Mobile phones are now an integral part of society, with drivers aged 21-40 being the most likely to be using a phone whilst driving, putting themselves and others at risk of serious or fatal injuries."

"We hope that by highlighting the tragic consequences of using a mobile phone and the long term impact it has on those families who lose loved ones that we can encourage people to 'put it down'.

"For those who choose to ignore that message we will be conducting enforcement checks across the three counties to enforce the law."

Throughout the planned week of action officers will be dedicated to detecting the use of mobile phones by drivers in order to send a clear message that it is both dangerous and unacceptable.

The campaign will also be supported by the local council & fire service who will join the police in engaging with the public directly, handing out free literature on dangerous driving.
