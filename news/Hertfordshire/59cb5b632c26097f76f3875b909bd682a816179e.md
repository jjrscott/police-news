"We always had each other through everything. She loved so hard and no matter what Christie was facing she always put on the bravest face for her three most beautiful children.

"I feel robbed and gutted. She was so strong and I hope she is only ever remembered for the brave and gentle soul she was. She is truly loved and missed. "I love you for ever and always baby girl. Until we meet again princess."

The family have requested that their privacy be respected at this very difficult time.
