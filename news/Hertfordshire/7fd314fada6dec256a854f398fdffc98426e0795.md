Police are appealing for information and witnessed following a serious collision in Letchworth this morning (Friday, October 5).

At around 11.20am, a black Peugeot 508 was involved in a collision with a toddler in Broadway.

The boy suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital.

Sergeant Will Hood, from the Road Policing Unit, said: "We are still working to establish exactly how this collision occurred and would like to speak to anyone who may have witnessed the incident.

"I would also appeal for any motorists with dash cams who were in the area around the time of the collision to check their footage for anything that may assist our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Sgt Hood by emailing william.hood@herts.pnn.police.uk, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting ISR 316 of October 5 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
