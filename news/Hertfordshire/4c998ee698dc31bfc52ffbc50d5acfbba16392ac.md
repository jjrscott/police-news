Fifteen new Special Constables were warmly welcomed into Hertfordshire Constabulary during their Attestation Ceremony at Police Headquarters in Welwyn Garden City on Thursday, March 8.

During eleven weeks of training, the new recruits learnt about basic law around theft, public order, assaults, traffic, powers of arrest and Stop and Search. They also used a virtual learning environment which trained them in legislation.

Each graduate went through a rigorous selection process and had to pass a final exam and practical assessments to enable them to qualify for the role of Special Constable.

Those that graduated are:

 * **Catherine Button** , who will be based at Broxbourne Police Station
 * **Abby Palmer** , who will be based at Broxbourne Police Station
 * **Gemma Luke** , who will be based at Hemel Hempstead Police Station
 * **Graeme Miller** , who will be based at Hemel Hempstead Police Station
 * **Christopher Pye** , who will be based at Hemel Hempstead Police Station
 * **Phoebe Davies** , who will be based at a police station in East Herts
 * **George Peek** , who will be based at a police station in East Herts
 * **Rochelle Staddon** , who will be based at a police station in North Herts
 * **Anna-Marie Wick** , who will be based at a police station in North Herts
 * **Archie Wiggs** , who will be based at a police station in North Herts
 * **Harrison Forsyth** , who will be based at St Albans Police Station
 * **Anthony Pearson** , who will be based at Rickmansworth Police Station
 * **Jordan Day-Cook** , who will be based at Watford Police Station
 * **Anthony Wilcock** , who will be based at Watford Police Station
 * **Mitchell Holloway** , who will be based at Hatfield Police Station

They were joined by their family and friends.

Over the next 12 months, the new recruits will continue their training, allowing them to pass out as substantive Special Constables once they are assessed as fit for independent patrol.

**Detective Chief Superintendent Michael Marren awarded the Specials with their certificates. He said:** "It is a great honour to welcome these new Special Constables to the Constabulary. The work they do is vital in helping us to police the county. I want to wish them all well as they now move on to undertake this important role within the communities of Hertfordshire."

**Special Superintendent Mike Allardyce said:** "As one of the Special Constabulary's senior leaders, I was delighted to meet our new Special Constables and I am very proud to welcome them to our dedicated team. Becoming a Special Constable brings with it the promise of being involved in something exciting, worthwhile and making a real difference in the local community as well as having the chance to learn new skills. I have no doubt they will make a significant contribution to policing in Hertfordshire."

**Police and Crime Commissioner for Hertfordshire, David Lloyd said:** "We're very fortunate to have such a dedicated team of Special Constables in Hertfordshire and they bring a different and valuable perspective to our policing.

"Our Specials have in the past provided specialist knowledge to some of the most challenging policing situations, including during major cyber-attacks, and we want to build on this by recruiting even more people to the role."

**Recruitment of Special Constables**

Hertfordshire Constabulary is actively recruiting Special Constables. It is looking for motivated team players wanting a challenge. Special Constables have full police powers, uniform and protective equipment and work alongside the regular force.

Special Constables get involved in all areas of frontline policing - from high visibility patrols around pubs and clubs at the weekend and being called to assist at the scene of a road traffic collision or burglary to arresting offenders or reassuring and advising residents after a crime has occurred.

Aside from 'response' or local Safer Neighbourhood policing, there are constantly evolving opportunities to work within specialist policing environments, such as the investigation of modern slavery, human trafficking, child sexual exploitation, cybercrime, domestic abuse and prisoner processing.

Those with an interest or expertise in countryside and rural issues can become Rural Special Constables who are dedicated to the needs of rural communities. They work alongside our Rural Operation Support Team (ROST) and local police Safer Neighbourhood Teams investigating heritage crime or wildlife offences, tackling hare coursing or poaching, to dealing with fly-tipping or the theft of heating oil.

Once initial training is complete, Specials are coached by regular officers to complete their Police Action Checklists and are then deemed fit for independent patrol. On average this can take around 12 months.
