More than 1,600 people attended an emergency services open day in Harpenden at the weekend.

The event on Saturday (September 1) was the first of its kind in the town and saw the police, fire and ambulance services come together at the fire station to give demonstrations and advice to visitors of all ages.

Neighbourhood Watch representatives were also in attendance to sign people up to the OWL messaging service, which allows people to receive alerts about crimes and incidents in their local area.

While the event was free to attend, visitors were invited to make donations to The Fire Fighters Charity and the local Volunteer Police Cadets. More than £2,300 was raised.

St Albans and Harpenden Volunteer Police Cadet leader Sergeant Steve Alison, who helped organise the event, said: "It was a huge success and I want to say a big thank you to everyone who played a part in that. The feedback from members of the public has been overwhelmingly positive and we will look to hold a similar event in future."
