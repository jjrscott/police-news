Police are appealing for witnesses following an incident of criminal damage in Hatfield.

At around 3.30pm on Monday, March 12 damage was caused to the front fog light of a BMW which was sitting in stationary traffic in Queensway, at the junction with Asda.

It is alleged that the damage was caused by another motorist who had walked over to the BMW.

PC Martin Field said: "It is believed that a woman driving a grey vehicle witnessed what happened and I am appealing for her to come forward. I would also like to hear from anyone else who saw the incident or events leading up to it. If you have any information please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact PC Field on the non-emergency number 101, or by email to martin.field@herts.pnn.police.uk, quoting crime reference B2/18/1051. You can also report information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report
