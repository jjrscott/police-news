Police in Bishop's Stortford are appealing for help and information in order to find three men who they believe could assist them with their investigation into a break-in at Sainsbury's in the town.

On Sunday January 14, at around 2.30am, a group of males broke into the store in Jackson Square via a staff door. Once inside they were challenged by staff and quickly left.

Officers would like to speak to the men in the photos, as they believe they were in the area at the time and may have information which could help their inquiry.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact PC Paul Lillie on 101 quoting crime reference number A2/18/81.

Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or submit information through their anonymous online form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court.
