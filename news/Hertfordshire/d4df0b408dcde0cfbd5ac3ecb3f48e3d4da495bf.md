A man has been jailed to a total of seven years following drugs offences in Welwyn Garden City.

Zamir Akram, age 21 of Kent Street, London, appeared for sentencing at Maidstone Crown Court on Thursday, January 24. This was following a trial in which he was found guilty of two counts of being in possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply.

Akram was stopped by the Operation Scorpion Team* in Thistle Grove on 17 October, 2018, and found to be in possession of crack cocaine and heroin.

He was sentenced to two years in prison for each offence, to run concurrently.

In addition to this sentencing, Akram was sentenced to five years for other drug offences in Kent and this will be served consecutively.

Detective Constable Ben Dransfield, who investigated the case, said: "Hertfordshire Constabulary is committed to keeping communities safe from drug dealing and associated criminality. I hope that this sentencing sends a clear message to those who wish to sell drugs.

"Reports from members of the public make a real difference to our investigations and I would urge anyone who suspects drugs activity in their local area to please continue to report it to us. Any information you provide could be the missing jigsaw piece which will lead us to catching an offender."

You can report information about drugs through the non-emergency number 101 or online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report.

*Operation Scorpion officers work in a specialist unit that tackles acquisitive crime - such as burglaries, robberies and drug offences - by relentlessly pursuing criminals and bringing them to justice.
