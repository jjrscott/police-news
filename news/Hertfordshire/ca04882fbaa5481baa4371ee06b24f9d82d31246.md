Evans was arrested after officers spotted him in Radlett Road, Watford, on November 12, 2018. He had been circulated as wanted and following a foot pursuit, was detained and arrested.

He was initially charged with three offences and remanded in custody. Further investigation was carried out and he was later charged with nine more offences.

Detective Constable Steve Mason, from the Three Rivers Local Crime Unit, said: "Evans is a prolific offender and has consistently displayed complete disregard for decent, hard-working members of the society by ruthlessly targeting homes, businesses and individuals for his own personal gain. He has shown himself to be a risk to the public with his willingness to threaten innocent people in order to get what he wants.

"I want today's sentencing to serve as a warning to travelling criminals - Hertfordshire is not a weak target for you. If you choose to commit offences in our county, we will catch up with you."
