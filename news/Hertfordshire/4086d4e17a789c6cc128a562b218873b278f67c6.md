Police are appealing for witnesses to an attempted robbery which occurred on Saturday (July 7) in Letchworth.

At 8.20pm the victim, an 80 year old woman, was at the junction of Station Way and The Meads when she was approached by a man who attempted to pull her shopping bag from her. The victim refused to let go, shouted at the offender and he made off towards Letchworth train station.

No items were stolen and the woman was not injured.

Anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident and saw what happened is asked to contact Detective Sergeant William Ainsworth by emailing or calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference number 41/15345/18. You can also report information online.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
