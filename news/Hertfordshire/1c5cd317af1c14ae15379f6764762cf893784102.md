* ### Man who threatened shoppers in Stevenage appears at court.

 * ### James Subbington stole knives from Tesco before heading into town centre shopping precinct.

A man who threatened people with knives in Stevenage town centre was sentenced last week.

James Stubbington (31) formally of Kingfisher Rise in Stevenage, was arrested on March 9, 2019, after he stole two knives from Tesco in the Forum and then went into the shopping precinct waving them around and threatening other shoppers.

He was subsequently charged with:

 * Two offences of possession of a bladed article in a public place
 * Theft from a shop
 * Affray

Stubbington was remanded in custody and appeared at St Albans Crown Court on Thursday June 6, where he pleaded guilty to all of the offences. He was sentenced to:

 * Six months in prison for the theft
 * Eight months in prison for the affray and possession of the knives
 * Two months for breaching a conditional discharge

All of the sentences will run concurrently.

Officer in the case PC Chris Jones said: "Although no one was hurt as a result of Stubbington's actions, this was a very frightening experience for many people who were shopping in the town centre at the time.

"By pleading guilty to the offences I hope he understands the gravity of his actions and will seek help to ensure this kind of behaviour is not exhibited again."
