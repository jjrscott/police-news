Police investigating the theft of a purse in Bishop's Stortford are releasing images of two people they would like to speak to for help with their enquiries.

At around 11.40am on Saturday, February 2, a woman had her purse stolen after shopping in Waitrose. It is believed it was taken while she was in the car park.

Her cards were then used to make transactions totalling £700.

Officers would like to speak with the people pictured as they may have information which could assist the investigation.

Anyone who recognises them, or has information about the theft, should contact PCSO Adam Pemberton via email or by calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/10693/19. You can also report information online _._

PCSO Pemberton said: "We would always advise people to remain vigilant while out and about and take some simple steps to help keep their property secure.

"When using bank and credit cards, always be aware of your surroundings and make sure to shield your PIN when entering it. Keep your purse at the bottom of your bag, make sure it's fully zipped up and never leave it unattended. If you're carrying a wallet, keep it in a front pocket.

"If you witness anyone acting in a suspicious manner, please report it."

 * Officers from the Local Safer Neighbourhood Team will be giving crime prevention advice at their upcoming 'Coffee With A Cop' events. Keep an eye on the @BStortPolice Twitter account for dates and locations.
