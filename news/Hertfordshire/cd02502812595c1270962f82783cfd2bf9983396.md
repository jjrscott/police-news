Detectives are appealing for witnesses following a house burglary in Station Way, Letchworth.

An eight-piece solid silver cutlery set, two solid silver candlestick holders, a silver hip flask and other silver and kitchenware were among the belongings stolen between 9.50am and 12noon on Thursday, May 23.

Burglars had forced entry by smashing a rear window and made an untidy search, taking a large JB sports bag.

Detective Constable Simon Goodship, who is investigating, said: "We are keen to hear from anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area on Thursday morning or anyone who is offered any silverware for sale in the coming days and weeks."

You can email DC Goodship via simon.goodship@herts.pnn.police.uk, report information online - quoting reference 41/46229/19 - at www.herts.police.uk/Report or speak to an operator in our Force Communications Room via web chat. This can be launched here: www.herts.police.uk/Contact
