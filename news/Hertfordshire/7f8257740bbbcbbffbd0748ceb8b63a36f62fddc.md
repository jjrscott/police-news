* ### A man has been jailed for over 3 years after pleading guilty to various drug offences.

 * ### Umar Baig, aged 26, was found in possession of both Class A and Class B drugs.

 * ### Detective Constable Geoff Webb says he hopes the custodial sentence serves as a warning to others who choose to involve themselves in drug related criminal activity.

A man has been jailed for 3 years and 6 months after being found in possession of both Class A and Class B drugs in St Albans last month.

Umar Baig, aged 26 and from Luton, appeared at St Albans Crown Court for sentencing on Monday 19 October, after previously pleading guilty to:

 * Possession with intent to supply Class A drugs (cocaine)
 * Possession with intent to supply Class B drugs (cannabis)
 * Possession of criminal property
 * Breach of suspended sentence.

The court heart how at around 3.30pm on Wednesday 9 September, officers stopped Baig's vehicle on Hatfield Road, St Albans.

Officers noticed that the vehicle smelt strongly of cannabis, and the occupants and vehicle were searched under Section 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. A large quantity of both Class A (cocaine) and Class B (cannabis) drugs were found in the vehicle. Baig was arrested at the scene.

Officers then attended his home address in St Albans to conduct a Section 18 search, where further drugs were found, as well as nun chucks, several mobile phones and almost Â£7,000 cash.

Detective Constable Geoff Webb, who investigated the case, said: "I am pleased that another drug offender has been taken off our streets. Drugs can have a hugely negative impact on our communities, and have particularly devastating consequences for vulnerable members of our society.

"We are dedicated to disrupting this type of criminality in Hertfordshire, and I hope that the custodial sentence Baig has received serves as a warning to others who choose to involve themselves in this sort of criminal activity: it will not be tolerated.

"We are always working to gain intelligence on criminality involving drugs, and I would urge any members of the public who suspect there is drug activity in their local area to please report it to us."
