Officers are appealing for information and witnesses following a garage burglary and car theft from two neighbours in Shrublands Avenue, Berkhamsted, at the weekend.

Between 5pm on Saturday, April 13, and 8am Sunday, April 14, offenders entered a garage and stole power tools, including three chainsaws, two power saws, an angle grinder, electric drill, a circular saw, a jigsaw and power breaker. A mountain bike was also stolen, while a second bike, which had a puncture, was found discarded nearby.

Police believe offenders loaded the haul into a neighbour's white Hyundai i10 Classic as it was also stolen overnight.

Sgt Ryan Hemmings said: "I am appealing for anyone who saw what happened or anyone who saw suspicious activity in the area at the time to get in touch. Also, if anyone is offered tools or a white Hyundai for sale, or have noticed the car abandoned, please get in touch.

"These crimes have caused distress for two residents so if you have information that could help, please call the non-emergency number 101 or email me at _ryan.hemmings@herts.pnn.police.uk_ quoting crime reference 41/33818/19."
