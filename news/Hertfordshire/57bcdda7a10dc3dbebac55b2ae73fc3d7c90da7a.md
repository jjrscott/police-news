Officers investigating an incident of ABH in St Albans are appealing for information and witnesses.

It happened on London Road at 4.35am on Saturday, March 24.

The victim, an 18-year-old man, was walking along the pavement with a female friend when a car slowed alongside them.

The occupants of the car, three or four white men, shouted verbal abuse at the pair.

The victim asked them to go away but the occupants of the car got out of the vehicle and assaulted him.

As a result, he suffered wounds to his head and right ear that required hospital treatment. He is now recovering at home.

PC James Irlen, who is investigating, said: "The victim was walking his friend home after a night out to make sure she was safe when he was set upon in this sickening attack.

"He has suffered some really nasty injuries and I want to reassure him that we are doing all we can to try and trace those responsible. I would also like to reassure the community that this type of incident is unusual in St Albans.

"I am eager to hear from any member of the public who was driving or walking by and may have passed the altercation as it was happening."

If you witnessed what happened, or have any further information that could assist the investigation, please email james.irlen2@herts.pnn.police.uk, report information online at www.herts.police.uk/report or call 101, quoting crime reference number F1/18/1350.
