Officers from the Stevenage Safer Neighbourhood Team have arrested four men following four commercial burglaries in the Bedwell and Town Centre areas of Stevenage. The offences took place in the early hours of Saturday 29 February.

The men were arrested a few hours later at an address in the town. The premises targeted were the Bedwell Pharmacy, Keach Hospice Care, the Card Factory and the library. The stolen property included a till and charity boxes.

Detectives from the Local Crime Unit have charged 33 year old Ben Horton of Brent Court with four offences of burglary. He was already on license and was recalled to prison after appearing at Hatfield Remand Court yesterday (Monday 2 March), where he pleaded guilty to the Bedwell pharmacy burglary.

Two men aged 28 and 31, both from Stevenage, have been released under investigation whilst inquiries continue. No further action has been taken in relation to the fourth man arrested.
