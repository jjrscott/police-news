Motorcycle owners are being invited to attend an event in Watford aimed at helping them to keep their vehicles more secure.

Officers from the Safer Neighbourhood Team will be present at the event on Saturday, April 7, along with representatives from security specialists.

Motorcyclists will be able to get advice on general security, as well as alarms, trackers and immobilisers. Officers will also be fitting tamperproof number plate screws.

PCSO Dominik Tokarczyk, who has organised the event, said: "There are many things that motorcycle owners can do to help keep their vehicles more secure. We hope that by bringing a number of services together in one place we can better equip owners against opportunist thieves."

The event will take place at B&Q in Lower High Street, between 10.30am and 1pm.
