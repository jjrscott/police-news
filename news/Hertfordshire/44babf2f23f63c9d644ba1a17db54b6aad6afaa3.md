Detectives in Stevenage are appealing for the public's help in order to trace a man they would like to speak to in connection with a series of cash thefts from shops in the town.

Officers believe the man pictured could have information which will help their inquiries. The thefts occurred between January 24 and February 10.

Anyone who recognises the man pictured is asked to contact Detective Sergeant Ben Dixon via the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/13483/19. You can also report information online.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form. In over 30 years, Crimestoppers charity has always kept its promise of anonymity to everyone who contacts them.
