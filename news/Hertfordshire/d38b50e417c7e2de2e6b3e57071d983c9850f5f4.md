A multi-agency operation took place in Hemel Hempstead on Wednesday (September 12) to detect, disrupt and deter cross border criminals.

Officers from the Safer Neighbourhood Team, Operation Scorpion, Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire (BCH) Road Policing Unit, BCH Dog Unit and Special Constabulary were involved in the action which saw several vehicles seized and a quantity of Class A drugs recovered.

Vehicles of interest were stopped on the busy arterial route near the M1 and taken to check points where drivers' details were verified and their vehicles were also examined for any defects.

Representatives from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) were in attendance to test for illegal fuel and the DVLA were also present to deal with any road tax offences.

Over 50 vehicles were stopped during the 6 hour operation.

 * 11 vehicles were seized for having no insurance
 * Two vehicles were seized for DVLA tax offences
 * One vehicle was found to be using red diesel and the vehicle was seized, with the driver fined
 * Four people were given Traffic Offence Reports (TORs) for offences including no MOT and driving with tyres below the legal limit
 * One person was issued with a cannabis warning

The following arrests were also made:

 * A 45 year old man from Oxfordshire was arrested on suspicion of drink driving and released without charge. He was also arrested on suspicion of driving whilst disqualified and was reported for this matter
 * A 21 year old man from London was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A and B drugs and has been bailed
 * Palitey Faye, aged 21, of Southborough Road, London, was charged with driving whilst disqualified and with no insurance

Dacorum Chief Inspector Paul Mitson said: "This kind of high-visibility multi-agency operation sends out a clear message that cross border offenders risk being caught if they come into Hertfordshire to commit their crimes. I was pleased with the results and we will look to hold similar operations in future."
