Police would like to identify the owner of the van pictured as part of their on-going enquiries following a fail to stop collision in Oxhey hall on Thursday afternoon (June 28)

At around 12.15pm, a vehicle was involved in a collision with two male pedestrians in Hampermill Lane.

Both pedestrians suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospital for treatment.

PC Mick McLeod from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit said: "We would like to urgently identify the owner of this van as we believe that person may have information that can help us with our enquiries."

Anyone who recognises the vehicle or knows who the owner is asked to contact PC McLeod by emailing michael.macleod@herts.pnn.police.uk, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting Op Cowl, or report information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
