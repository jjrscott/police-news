A man has been charged and remanded in connection with a neighbourhood dispute in Stevenage.

Carl Adaway, aged 52, of Holly Copse, Stevenage was charged with using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause fear/provoke unlawful violence (Section 4 of the Public Order Act 1986).

This is in connection with an incident on Thursday 30 July where a number of people in Holly Copse were verbally threatened. One person was threatened with a hammer.

Adaway was remanded in custody and is scheduled to appear at Stevenage Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 15 September.

Sergeant Chris Adshead, who leads the Stevenage Central Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "We will not tolerate communities being subject to persistent anti-social behaviour issues, and I would like to thank our colleagues from the Case Investigation Team in Stevenage whose diligent work greatly assisted us in achieving a charge and remand for this incident.

"We now await the outcome of Adaway's court appearance in September."
