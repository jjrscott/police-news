Police are appealing for information and witnesses following a GBH in Watford.

The incident happened on Wednesday, May 30, just before 5pm.

At this time, the victim - a 64 year old man, was cycling along Bushey Mill Lane when the offender, who is described as a white male, was cycling towards him. The victim moved to avoid him and the offender then kicked him off his bicycle before continuing along Bushey Mill Lane.

Detective Constable Matt Cox, who is investigating, said: "This was a nasty attack which left the victim with a serious spinal injury. He was taken to hospital, where he is still receiving treatment.

"I am appealing for anyone who might have seen what happened, or saw the offender, to get in touch.

"I'd like people to take a look at the image of the victim's bicycle - if you remember seeing the victim riding this, do you remember seeing the incident?

"Anyone with information should contact me on matthew.cox@herts.pnn.police.uk or the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/2686/18. You can also report information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report."

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
