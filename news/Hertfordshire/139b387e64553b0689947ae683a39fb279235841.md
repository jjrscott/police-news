Officers from the local Safer Neighbourhood Team attended a multi-faith community event in Watford.

'Plant for Peace' was organised by the Watford Inter Faith Association (WIFA) and took place in Cassiobury Park.

Hate crime officer PC Rachael Byrne and PCSO Sarah Thomas joined representatives from a number of different faiths and religions to plant bulbs across the park area.

PC Byrne said: "Watford has a very diverse community and this event was a fantastic way to engage with people from a number of different faith groups and religions. It was a great day and I'm looking forward to seeing the results of our efforts in the spring."
