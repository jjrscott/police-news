Police are releasing an image of a man they would like to speak to as part of their enquiries following an incident of cashpoint fraud in Leavesden.

A skimming and recording device was placed on a cash machine outside the Co-op in Cunningham Way, Leavesden.

The device was noticed by a member of the public who used the cashpoint just before 6.30pm on April 4. It was removed and the police were informed.

Officers would like to speak to the man pictured as they believe he may have been in the area and may have information that could assist the investigation.

Anyone who recognises him is asked to contact PC Jamie Negrello by emailing jamie.negrello@herts.pnn.police.uk, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/30818/19 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, you can stay 100 per cent anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or submit details via their untraceable online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
