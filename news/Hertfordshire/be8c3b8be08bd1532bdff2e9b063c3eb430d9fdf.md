Officers are appealing for help to trace the victim of an assault in Letchworth Garden City.

It happened outside a property in Grange Road just before 4.30am this morning.

Police were called to report that there were an unknown number of people involved in a physical altercation in the street.

Officers attended the scene to make enquiries but those involved had already left the area. Evidence of an assault has been found in the vicinity, however the victim has not yet made contact with police, so officers are now trying to trace them.

Inspector Mark Corkin, who is investigating, said: "We believe the person who was assaulted was injured as a result, and we need to speak to them as soon as possible as we have concern for their welfare.

"I want to reassure residents that officers are currently making enquiries in the area, as well as checking local hospitals and medical care centres to see if someone has presented with injuries consistent with being assaulted.

"If you are the victim, or one of your family members or friends appears to have been assaulted, please let us know and encourage them to seek medical treatment as soon as possible.

"Any witnesses or anyone with information should call the non-emergency number 101, quoting ISR 168 of December 1. You can also report information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report, or by speaking to one of our control room operators via web chat."

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
