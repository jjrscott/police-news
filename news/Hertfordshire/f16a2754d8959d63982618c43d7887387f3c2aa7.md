* ### PC Ryan Proudlock and PC Thomas Coulton both received awards in recognition of their life-saving actions

 * ### In February last year, they gave CPR to a man in cardiac arrest outside the YMCA in Watford

 * ### Their initial actions meant paramedics were able to administer life saving treatment to the man, who later made a full recovery

Two police officers in Watford have received Royal Humane Society awards after their quick-thinking actions saved a man's life.

In February last year, PC Ryan Proudlock and PC Thomas Coulton attended a concern for welfare incident outside the YMCA in Watford, where a man was in cardiac arrest.

The man was cold to the touch, unresponsive and was not breathing so the officers cleared his airway and began CPR, which they carried on until paramedics arrived on scene.

The officers, from Watford's Intervention and Response Team 4, continued to give CPR while the ambulance service administered live-saving treatment to the man before he was rushed to hospital.

Thankfully he made a full recovery and was discharged from hospital a few days later. PC Proudlock met the man a few weeks later, who thanked the officers for their actions.

The officers said: "Working on the Intervention team means you never quite know what incidents you are going to be called to, and this shows that sometimes, you could be required to save a life. We are so pleased the man made a full recovery and wish him all the best."
