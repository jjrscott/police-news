Police in Watford will be carrying out a series of operations to target drivers illegally using a purpose-built road, constructed for emergency vehicles.

Police have received several calls about motorists deliberately contravening the 'No Entry' signs situated at both ends of the top section of Thomas Sawyer Way.

PC Graham Green, from the Local Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "This route can potentially save vital minutes of travel time for ambulances on a blue-light run. However, many drivers have been using the road to bypass the town centre, to gain access to the M1 or routes towards Bushey and beyond.

"Doing so is illegal and we will be issuing Traffic Offence Reports (TORs) to anyone caught using the route. The road is for use by emergency vehicles and buses only and this is very clearly displayed through signage."

A TOR can be issued by police for a minor road traffic offence and can lead to drivers receiving a fine.
