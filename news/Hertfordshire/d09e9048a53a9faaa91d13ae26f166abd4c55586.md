Officers in Bishop's Stortford have issued a CCTV photo of two people they would like to speak to following a purse theft in the town.

Between 4pm and 4.30pm on Friday, October 26, an 82 year old woman had her purse stolen from her bag while shopping in Aldi in London Road.

Officers would like to hear from the man and woman pictured as it's believed they were in the area at the time and could have vital information.

PCSO Tea Prow from the Bishop's Stortford & Sawbridgeworth Safer Neighbourhood Team said: "Extensive enquiries have been carried out and we are now asking for the public's help in identifying the people in these CCTV images.

"If you recognise them, or have other information about the theft, please get in touch on the non-emergency number 101 quoting crime reference 41/50459/18. You can also report information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report.

"As we lead into the Christmas period with the shops becoming busier, I would like to remind shoppers to be vigilant in all stores and be aware of what is going on around you. Remember to always keep your bag in sight. It can be a good idea to wear your bag diagonally across yourself so that you have it close to you at all times."

You can also contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
