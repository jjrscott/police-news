Officers have released a CCTV image of a man who might be able to help with their enquiries following a public order offence in Stevenage.

At around 9.45am on Sunday, May 5, the victim, a man in his 30s, walked out of the One Stop shop in Broadwater Crescent and noticed a man shouting into his phone.

The man then began verbally abusing the victim and pulled out what is believed to be a penknife before continuing to shout at and threaten the victim.

The victim started to walk away and said he would call police, after which the offender ran in the opposite direction.

Officers would like to speak with the person pictured as he may have information which could assist the investigation.
