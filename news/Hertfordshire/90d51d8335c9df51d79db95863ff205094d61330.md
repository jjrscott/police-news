Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a man who is wanted.

Ishtiyak Shah, aged 46, whose last known address is Kensington Avenue in Watford is wanted in connection with a robbery, which is reported to have occurred in Park Avenue, Watford, on July 20.

He also has links to the South Oxhey area.

Anyone who sees Ishtiyak or knows of his whereabouts is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/19569/18 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
