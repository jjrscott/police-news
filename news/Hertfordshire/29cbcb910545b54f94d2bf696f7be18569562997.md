Officers investigating a robbery in Waltham Cross are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to get in contact.

At 2.20pm on Monday, February 4 a man parked his car in the High Street Car Park when a blue Ford Focus reversed up to him.

One man got out of the car and grabbed the victim's rucksack which contained thousands of pounds and personal items, before assaulting the victim and running back to the Ford Focus and driving off.

Sergeant Adam Bridges, from the Broxbourne Local Crime Unit, said: "If you witnessed this incident or have seen two males in a blue Ford Focus acting suspiciously in this area, please get in touch."

Any witnesses or anyone with information should contact Sgt Bridges on _adam.bridges@herts.pnn.police.uk_ or the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/11395/19. You can also report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report
