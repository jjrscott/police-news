* ### 55-year-old Michael Summerville was sentenced to 9 years and 9 months for wounding with intent and possession of an offensive weapon.

 * ### Summerville stabbed his former partner multiple times on Wednesday 27 November.

 * ### The victim sustained a serious injury to his eye.

A man has been sentenced to nine years and nine months in prison following a stabbing in St Albans.

55-year-old Michael Summerville, of no fixed address, was jailed at St Albans Crown Court last week (Tuesday 3 March) having previously pleaded guilty to Section 18 wounding with intent and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place.

Police were called to St Peters Street, St Albans, in the early hours of Wednesday 27 November 2019, to reports that a man had sustained multiple stab wounds.

Upon arrival they found the victim, who was Summerville's partner at the time, had sustained serious injuries - there were three stab wounds in total; one in his eye, one in his chest and one in his back.

He was taken via air ambulance to a London hospital where he received specialist treatment.

Summerville fled the scene, and was caught on CCTV discarding the knife he used in the attack down a drain. He was arrested shortly after.

Detective Constable Richard Staff, who investigated the case, said: "The victim sustained horrific injuries in what was a vicious, unprovoked attack. Thankfully, he has since recovered, but still suffers with some eye complications and of course the emotional trauma of what happened to him.

"As well as the impact on his physical health, Summerville's actions have had a huge impact on his mental health. No one should ever have to experience abuse from their partner, or live in fear. We hope this result gives him some peace of mind, and serves as some sort of closure for him.

"I hope Summerville now uses his time in prison to reflect on what he did, and also that this sentence sends a strong and clear message to anyone considering carrying a knife. If you use a knife as a weapon, we will use all the powers at our disposal to bring you to justice and you can expect to be sent to prison.

"Regardless of the fact that it's illegal, carrying a knife poses very real risks and serious consequences. Not only do you risk a custodial sentence for possession of a knife, but you could end up causing serious harm to someone, taking someone's life or losing your own."
