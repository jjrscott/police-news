Police are releasing an image of a man they would like to speak to as part of their enquiries following a commercial burglary in Watford.

At around 3.30pm on Monday, September 24 an offender entered an office in Colonial Way and stole a wallet. The victim's bank card was used a short time later to pay for goods at a grocery store in Watford.

Officers would like to speak to the man pictured as he may have information that can help the investigation.

Anyone who recognises him is asked to contact PC Mo Huzair by emailing, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/40473/18 or report information online.

Alternatively, if you'd rather provide information anonymously contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
