Hertfordshire Constabulary has made a referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) with regards to an arrest made in Hatfield earlier this week.

The original incident occurred when uniformed officers on patrol saw a male acting suspiciously on Tuesday 14 July. The male made off from police. Officers then pursued and an arrest was made.

A 16 year old was arrested on suspicion of drug possession with intent to supply and assaulting a police officer with intent to resist arrest. He was released under investigation.

It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.
