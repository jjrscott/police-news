A man has been charged with attempted robbery following an incident in St Albans.

Abdul-wali Ahmadzai, aged 27, of no fixed address, was charged on Friday evening (27 November) as part of an investigation by the St Albans Local Crime Unit.

He appeared before Hatfield Remand Court the following day, where he was remanded into custody to appear before Crown Court at a later date.

Police were called to a property in Drakes Drive on the evening of Thursday 26 November.

It is alleged that a man entered a house via an insecure front door and was challenged by the occupant in the hallway. The man reportedly demanded money, before a struggle ensued. He was detained until police arrived.

No one was injured during the incident and nothing was taken.
