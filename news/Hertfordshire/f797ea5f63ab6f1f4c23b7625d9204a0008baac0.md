Officers are appealing for the public's help to trace a man who is wanted.

Martyn Reilly, aged 59 and of no fixed address, is wanted for failing to appear at St Albans Magistrates' Court on July 3 in connection with a burglary offence.

He has connections to the Welwyn Garden City and Hatfield areas.

Anyone who knows of Martyn's whereabouts is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101 or report information online.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
