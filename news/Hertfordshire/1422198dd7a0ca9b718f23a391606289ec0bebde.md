Police are appealing for information and witnesses following an incident in Hertford.

On Sunday, September 23, the victim - a man aged in his 20s - suffered serious facial injuries after leaving Popworld in Bull Plain at around 2.30am.

Detective Constable Shaun Turner, from the Hertford Local Crime Unit, said: "The victim, who suffered a fractured jaw, a serious eye injury and cuts to his face, has no recollection of how he sustained these injuries.

"At this stage we are exploring the possibility that he may have been the victim of an assault. We know that after leaving Popworld he travelled to his home near Ware Road, Hertford, and I'm appealing for anyone who may have seen an incident between 2.30am and 3.30am in the area to get in touch as you may have information that can help us piece together exactly what has happened."

Anyone with information, no matter how small, is asked to contact DC Turner by emailing calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/39450/18 or report information online.

Alternatively, contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
