Officers from the Roads Policing Unit are currently investigating a collision in Watford.

The incident happened at 5.10am this morning (Tuesday 22 October) on the Watford Town Hall roundabout and involved a car containing three occupants.

 Police and other emergency services are on the scene and the entire roundabout and the Colosseum car park are currently closed off and will remain this way for some time.

 Traffic diversions are in place, but we are asking people to avoid the area where possible while the road closure are in place.
