Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a man who is wanted.

Ackeron Alleyne, aged 24, who has links to Stevenage and North Herts, is wanted in connection with failing to appear at court and breach of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order.

Ackeron is also known as 'Kieron' and 'AK'.

Anyone who sees him or knows of his whereabouts is asked to contact the Stevenage Scorpion Team via the non-emergency number 101 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
