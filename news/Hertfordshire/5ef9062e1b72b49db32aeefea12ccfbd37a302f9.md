Police investigating a burglary where a car, jewellery and £20,000 in cash were stolen from a house in Grangewood, Little Heath, have released photographs of two suspects.

The offenders stole a safe containing jewellery, watches and cash and drove off in the homeowner's orange Ford Ranger just after 3.05pm on Friday, March 29.

"The two suspects entered the house in broad daylight wearing balaclavas. They were disturbed by the householder, who raised the alarm before giving chase and attempting to open the car door as they drove off. If you recognise either man, please get in touch as soon as possible," said Detective Sergeant Dean Trollope.
