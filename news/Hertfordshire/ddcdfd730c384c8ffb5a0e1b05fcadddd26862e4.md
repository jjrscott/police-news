The victim, a 19-year-old man from Watford, was taken to hospital, where his condition is described as stable.

Both of the arrested people have now been charged:

 * A 17 year from Colindale has been charged with attempted murder.

They will both appear at Hatfield Remand Court today.

Officers are continuing to appeal for the public's help in relation to this incident. Anyone who saw what happened, or has information that could assist the investigation, is asked to get in touch via the non-emergency number 101 quoting ISR 583 of November 7 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

In particular, officers are working to recover two items of clothing that could help with the investigation.
