Officers investigating a theft in St Albans are releasing CCTV images of a woman they would like to speak to as part of their enquiries.

Between 2.30pm and 2.56pm on November 24, 2018, a man's bank card was stolen when he walked from Metro Bank into the Card Factory next door on St. Peters Street.

The victim, a man in his 30s, only realised his card had been stolen from the back pocket of his jeans when he was in the Card Factory store.

The offender made contactless purchases on the victim's card on six occasions at two different stores, after which the bank stopped the card.

PC John Endersby from the St Albans Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT) said: "We have carried out extensive enquiries since this incident occurred, but we are now appealing to the public as the suspect remains outstanding.

"We believe the woman pictured may be able to assist with our enquiries so we ask that anyone who recognises her to please get in contact."

Any witnesses or anyone with information should contact PC Endersby on _john.endersby@herts.pnn.police.uk_ or the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/59324/19. You can also report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report
