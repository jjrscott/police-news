Officers investigating a collision in Hitchin are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information to get in contact.

At around 11.15am on Saturday, April 20, a blue Honda Jazz was in collision with a blue Hyundai i10 in the Iceland car park on Biggin Lane.

No one sustained any injuries.

PC Chris Brown, who is investigating, said: "It was a busy market day and we suspect there are a number of people who saw the collision and the events leading up to it.

"We are asking any witnesses to get in contact via email on _chris.brown@herts.pnn.police.uk_ or the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference ISR 228 of April 20. You can also report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report _. "_

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.

 * A 76-year-old man from Letchworth Garden City was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol and was released under investigation while enquiries continue.
