Police are continuing to appeal for witnesses and information following a fail to stop collision in Stevenage and are particularly keen to trace a male cyclist who stopped at the scene.

The incident occurred in Vardon Way, at around 6.35pm on Monday 13 January. An 81-year-old man was struck by a vehicle, which was not at the scene on police arrival.

He remains in a serious but stable condition in hospital at this time.

Sergeant William Hood from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit said: "We are continuing to appeal for witnesses to the incident to please come forward.

"Enquiries suggest that a red Toyota Prius may have been involved in the collision and we are keen to trace this vehicle and its driver as a matter of urgency. It's likely that the vehicle may have sustained noticeable damage so I would ask people to please keep an eye out for it.

"I am also appealing for the cyclist who initially stopped at the scene to please come forward, as you may have vital evidence which could assist us. It is believed he was a Polish man.

"Additionally, if you have a dash cam which may have recorded footage of the incident, or events prior to it, please contact us."
