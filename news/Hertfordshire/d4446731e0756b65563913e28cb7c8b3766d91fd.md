* ### Extension granted to Monument Court Closure Order

 * ### Action aimed at preventing owner from returning

 * ### Local resident's lives dramatically improved since the adddress was closed

An extension has been granted by Stevenage Magistrates today (Thursday April 11) to a closure order on a flat in **Monument Court,** in a bid to prevent the residents returning. The Closure Order was due to expire on Sunday April 14.

The flat is privately owned and had been linked to drug dealing, drug use and people causing a disturbance in the flat and the communal areas

The original Closure Order was granted on Tuesday January 15, under the Anti-Social Behaviour Crime and Policing Act 2014. It banned anyone from entering the property for three months.

Sergeant Simon Mullan from the Stevenage Community Safety Unit said **:** "Since we have closed this property we have seen a dramatic reduction in the amount of anti-social behaviour at Monument Court.

"Having spoken to residents we know that their quality of life has significantly improved. People have a right to feel safe in their own homes, which is why we have sought this extension while we work with partners to find a permanent solution.

 "I would continue to urge members of the community to report any anti-social behaviour of this nature to the police."

**_Anyone with information about anti-social behaviour should call the non-emergency number 101 or report online at www.herts.police.uk/report. Remember if a crime is in progress or someone 's life is in danger, always call 999 straight away._**
