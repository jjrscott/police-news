A black Vauxhall Astra was travelling in the direction of Stotfold Road when it was in collision with two other stationary vehicles, causing damage to both.

"If you saw a vehicle matching the description driving erratically in the vicinity of Wilshere Crescent, we would like to hear from you.

"If you think you can help please email me, report information online or call 101, quoting reference ISR 70 of the August 27.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
