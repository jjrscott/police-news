Seven new Special Constables were warmly welcomed into Hertfordshire Constabulary during their Attestation Ceremony at Police Headquarters this month.

They join our ever-growing force of 265 volunteer Special Constables, who have full police powers, uniform and protective equipment and work alongside the regular force.

Assistant Chief Constable Nathan Briant awarded the Specials with their certificates on Thursday 8 August. He said: "The work that our Special Constables do is vital in helping us to police the county and it is a great honour to welcome these hardworking Specials to the Constabulary. I was delighted to meet them and wish them all well as they now move on to undertake this important role within the communities of Hertfordshire."

If you'd like to follow in their footsteps, we have regular information evenings at Police Headquarters for people to find out more about joining the Special Constabulary. If you wish to attend the next one, please email _specialsrecruitment@herts.pnn.police.uk_

During 11 weeks of training, the new recruits learnt about basic law around theft, public order, assaults, traffic, powers of arrest and stop and search. They also used a virtual learning environment which trained them in legislation.

Each graduate went through a rigorous selection process and had to pass a final exam and practical assessments to enable them to qualify for the role of Special Constable.

Those who graduated are:

**East Herts**

 * **Daniel Moakes** who works as a network engineer.

**Hertsmere**

 * **Robert Cordiner** who is studying for an HND in Public Services.

**St Albans**

 * **Daniel Graham** who works as a senior production manager.
 * **Nathan Scott** who is a supermarket buyer.

**Three Rivers**

 * **Anton Deacon** who works for a borough council.
 * **Conor Fountain** who is a chef manager at a private school.

**Watford**

 * **Elaine De Oliveira** who works in a steak house.

They were joined on the evening by family, friends and local dignitaries, including East Herts Mayor Rosemary Bolton, Hertsmere Mayor Alan Plancey, St Albans Mayor Janet Smith, Watford's Deputy Mayors Karen Collett and Stephen Cavinder and Welwyn Hatfield Mayor Roger Trigg.

Over the next 12 months, the new recruits will continue their training, allowing them to pass out as substantive Special Constables once they are assessed as fit for independent patrol.

**Special Constabulary Chief Officer, Mark Kendrew said:** "I am very proud to welcome our new Special Constables to our dedicated team. They have been through a rigorous recruitment process and spent a number of weeks completing the intensive training required to fulfil the role of a Special Constable.

"Becoming a Special Constable brings with it the promise of being involved in something exciting, worthwhile and that makes a real difference in the local community as well as having the chance to learn new skills. I have no doubt they will make a significant contribution to policing in Hertfordshire."

**Assistant Police and Crime Commissioner** **for Hertfordshire** **Stuart Nagler** **said:** "What a delight it was to welcome our new Specials to our expanding police team in Hertfordshire. We are very fortunate to have such a dedicated team of Special Constables, who bring a wealth of skills and life experience to policing. I wish them all the very best as they embark on their first shifts."

A short film has recently been launched to showcase the exciting role of a Special Constable in the hope it will encourage more people to volunteer with Hertfordshire's Special Constabulary. You can view the video on the Herts Police YouTube channel.

**Recruitment of Special Constables**

Hertfordshire Constabulary is actively recruiting Special Constables. It is looking for motivated team players wanting a challenge. Special Constables are volunteers who have full police powers, uniform and protective equipment and work alongside the regular force.

Special Constables get involved in all areas of frontline policing - from high visibility patrols around pubs and clubs at the weekend and being called to assist at the scene of a road traffic collision or burglary to arresting offenders or reassuring and advising residents after a crime has occurred. Hertfordshire Constabulary are piloting 'Career Pathways' and have a number of specialist opportunities for officers.

Once initial training is complete, Specials are posted to local response or neighbourhood teams and are coached by regular officers to complete their Police Action Checklists and are then deemed fit for independent patrol. On average this can take around 12 months. Once the officers are fit for independent patrol, they can apply for a posting to a specialist teams.

Aside from 'response' or local Safer Neighbourhood policing, there are constantly evolving opportunities to work within specialist policing environments, such as the investigation of modern slavery, human trafficking, cybercrime, domestic abuse, proactive units targeting local drug dealers, wanted persons, night time economy issues and prisoner processing.

Those with an interest or expertise in countryside and rural issues can become Rural Special Constables who are dedicated to the needs of rural communities. They work alongside our Rural Operation Support Team (ROST) and local police Safer Neighbourhood Teams investigating heritage crime or wildlife offences, tackling hare coursing or poaching, to dealing with fly-tipping or crop damage.
