We have intelligence to suggest that an illegal rave is due to take place at a location in the north of the county this evening (Friday, March 16).

A large number of people are expected to arrive at either Stevenage or Hitchin railway stations later tonight and resources are in place if this occurs.

Inspector James Lant says: "We would like to reassure the community that we are fully prepared for this eventuality and we will be attending and dispersing any illegal raves that happen in our county this evening - it will not be tolerated.

"Officers will not hesitate to use their powers under Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 to give those attending the rave orders to leave, as well as seizing any sound equipment where necessary.

"We will crack down hard on any individuals or groups that exhibit anti-social behaviour and cause a noise nuisance within our community.

"If you have concerns that a large group is gathering within your street or neighbourhood, please do not hesitate to call us on 101. If there is an immediate danger or threat to life, always call 999."
