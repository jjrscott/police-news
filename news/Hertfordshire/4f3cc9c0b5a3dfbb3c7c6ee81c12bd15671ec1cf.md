* ### Two new neighbourhood police officers will be posted to London Colney and Colney Heath later this month.

 * ### Increasing visibility in London Colney and Colney Heath is a priority.

 * ### Thefts from insecure motor vehicles remain a big problem - **lock your car and double check it is secure**.

Safer Neighbourhood Inspector Jon Roche is reassuring residents that police are continuing to deal with crime robustly in London Colney and Colney Heath.

He said: "Residents may not have seen as many high-visibility officers in London Colney and Colney Heath recently and I understand that this might have raised some concerns. I would like to reassure residents that is a temporary situation while vacant posts in the Neighbourhood team are filled. Two new police officers will take up their posts later this month.

"However, colleagues from the _London Colney, St Stephens and St Albans East Safer Neighbourhood Team_ have been covering the area and they are well supported by intervention officers, who deal with emergency calls. Colney Heath also has a dedicated PCSO Abbie Proctor and PCSO Debbie Daniels covers London Colney and Colney Fields."

Increasing visibility across London Colney and the rest of the district is really important to us as we know that the presence of police in the area helps to make our communities feel safe and reassured. Please be assured that we are committed to doing exactly that."

He explained: "London Colney and Colney Heath have safer neighbourhood officers (PCs and PCSOs), intervention officers and the Local Crime Unit, who investigate burglaries and robberies. More serious or specialist crimes are dealt with by other departments, so both areas are well policed. Some of this work may be covert and residents would not usually be aware that this work is ongoing. Whilst both areas are well policed, we accept it is not as visible as we are aiming for."

He said: "We are seeing a significant number of thefts from motor vehicles in London Colney and Colney Heath, however this is not an issue that is unique to this area. More than 80 per cent of vehicles are left insecure. This is incredibly frustrating from our point of view as these crimes could be easily prevented by residents **locking their vehicles and double checking they are locked**.

"We also work closely with partner agencies including St Albans City and District Council and other organisations, including housing associations, to deal with crime and anti-social behaviour and want residents to continue to report incidents to us. You can call 101 or report online \- always call 999 in an emergency if a crime is in progress or a person's life is in danger."

He added: "When you report a crime please provide as much evidence as possible to assist us in the investigation. Dependant on the circumstances this may include checking with your neighbours whether they witnessed anything or have any CCTV before reporting the matter to us."

The Safer neighbourhood team regularly runs crime prevention events, including a vehicle plate safe event in London Colney in May. For further crime prevention advice.
