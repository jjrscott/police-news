* ### The operation aimed to check that licensed premises were correctly adhering to age verification schemes.

 * ### A total of 24 premises were visited in Watford and Three Rivers.

 * ### The majority did ask for ID and refuse underage sales.

Volunteer Police Cadets assisted with a test purchase operation conducted across Watford and Three Rivers last week.

Four cadets from Hemel Hempstead, aged 16 and 17, assisted the local Community Safety Unit with the operation on Wednesday (July 18), which aimed to check that licensed premises were correctly adhering to age verification schemes.

They were tasked with attempting to purchase cigarettes or alcohol from 24 locations.

Sergeant Luke Mitchell from the Watford and Three Rivers Community Safety Unit said: "It was pleasing to see that the majority of premises visited did ask for identification and subsequently refuse the sales.

"However, there were a handful that did fail and words of advice have been given. These stores will also receive follow up visits and information has been passed on to Trading Standards.

"I'd like to thank the cadets for volunteering their time to take part. It was an interesting operation and we will be conducting similar visits in future."
