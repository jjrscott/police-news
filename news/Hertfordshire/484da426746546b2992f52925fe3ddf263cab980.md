Detectives in East Herts have released images of a man they would like to speak to following a burglary in Hertford.

On Friday January 5, a house in Ware Road was broken into and a quantity of cash and other items taken. The burglary happened sometime between 3.30pm and 4.20pm.

Officers would like to speak to the man pictured as they believe he could have information which will help the investigation.

Officers are also releasing a photograph of some cufflinks and war medals which were stolen in the burglary.

Investigating officer Nicola Morris said: "If anyone thinks they know this man or has seen any of the items stolen, please contact me as soon as possible on 101 quoting crime reference number A1/18/80. The items stolen are quite unusual and should be easily identifiable.

"Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court."
