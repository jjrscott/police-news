Officers are warning motorists not to speed as people return to the county's roads following the government's announcement to gradually lift lockdown restrictions.

A two-week speeding campaign starts Monday 25 May that aims to prevent people from being seriously injured or killed as the number of road users increase.

Chief Inspector Jon Roche, Head of the BCH Roads Policing Unit, said: "As people return to work and roads get busier it is vital that everyone takes extra care when driving. One of the best and easiest ways to do this is to reduce your speed. This is because the faster you drive, the less time you have to react to changing circumstances. Please drive carefully, be mindful of others and get to your destinations safely."

Motorists are also being urged to look out for cyclists and pedestrians who may have become accustomed to quieter conditions. CI Roche added: "Driving within speed limits can give motorists precious extra time to look for cyclists and pedestrians. A few seconds might not seem much but it can be enough to prevent a collision. And if you do collide with someone, the slower your speed, the less likely you are to kill or seriously injure them or yourself."
