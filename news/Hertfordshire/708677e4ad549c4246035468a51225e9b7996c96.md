* ### Officers investigating arson at former school

 * ### Did you see anything suspicious?

 * ### Call 101 quoting reference number 41/66448/19

Police investigating an arson at the former Norton school site in Letchworth Garden City are appealing for witnesses and information.

Between 1pm and 1.40pm on Monday 22 July, offenders started two small fires in the doorway of the old school gym at the rear of the building, causing a large blaze.

Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service attended and extinguished the fire, which damaged the doorway.

Officers from the Letchworth and Baldock Safer Neighbourhood Team are appealing for anyone who saw anything suspicious to get in touch.

PC Caroline Fathers, who is investigating, said: "The gym block is fenced off and the only entrance is through a locked gate, so offenders would have scaled the gate or tampered with the lock. I'd like to speak to anyone who has noticed people acting suspiciously in the area."

Anyone who has information about the incident should contact PC Fathers _caroline.fathers@herts.pnn.police.uk_ at Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/66448/19. You can also report information online at www.herts.police.uk/ Report or speak to an operator in our Force Communications Room via our online web chat, which can be launched here: www.herts.police.uk/Contact
