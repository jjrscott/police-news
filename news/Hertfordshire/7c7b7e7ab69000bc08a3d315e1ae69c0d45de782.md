Officers are appealing for information and witnesses following a burglary in Welwyn.

Between 8.30am and 5.23pm on Wednesday, January 9, offender(s) gained access to a house in Canonsfield after smashing a rear patio door.

An untidy search was carried out and a quantity of cash was taken along with passports. The following jewellery items were also taken:

 * A silver Pandora charm bracelet
 * A bangle
 * A chain bracelet
 * A ring
 * Earrings
 * A white ring
 * A pink and gold charm bracelet

It is believed that the offender(s) were disturbed by an occupant returning home before making off via the rear of the house in an unknown direction.

Detective Constable Kylie Davies, who is investigating, said: "I am appealing for anyone who might have seen what happened, or suspicious activity, to get in touch. Similarly, if you believe you've been offered any of the jewellery for sale, I would like to hear from you.

"If you can help, please get in touch on the non-emergency number 101 or via email at _kylie.davies@herts.pnn.police.uk_ quoting crime reference 41/2792/19."
