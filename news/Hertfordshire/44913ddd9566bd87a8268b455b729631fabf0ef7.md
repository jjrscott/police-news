Police are appealing to the public for their help in locating a wanted woman.

Kelly Cross, aged 34, who has no fixed address, is wanted for failing to appear in court and for not complying with a Supervision Order.

She is frequently in Welwyn Garden City and is believed to be living in Liverpool.

Anyone who sees Kelly, or has any information about her whereabouts, is asked to contact Paul Hollis from the Local Policing Command intelligence Unit by emailing, submitting information online quoting crime reference 41/10826/19 or call the non-emergency number 101.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form.

For over 30 years, Crimestoppers has always kept its promise of anonymity to everyone who contacts them.
