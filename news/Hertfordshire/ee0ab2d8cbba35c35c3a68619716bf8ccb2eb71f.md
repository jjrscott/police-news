Detective Inspector Alexandra Warwick, from the St Albans Local Crime Unit, said: "The victim has been left shaken and scarred by this vicious attack and I understand this incident may also cause concern in the local community. I want to reassure people that we are doing all we can to establish the circumstances around what happened and to trace anyone who may have been involved.

"There will be an increased police presence in the area over the weekend and a section 35 dispersal order has also been put in place, which allows officers to direct people to move on from the area if they feel they may cause harassment, alarm or distress to residents or increase the risk of crime and disorder. If you have any concerns, please do not hesitate to speak with us.

"I would also encourage anyone with information to assist the investigation to make contact."
