* ### We're appealing for witnesses to a fatal road collision

 * ### Were you travelling on Anchor Lane, Wadesmill?

 * ### A motorcyclist, aged 45, sadly lost his life

Police investigating a fatal collision are appealing for witnesses and information.

Officers are appealing to anyone who was travelling along Anchor Lane, in Wadesmill, at around 6.05pm today (Wednesday 16 September) and saw a red Ducati motorcycle on the route.

The motorcycle left the carriageway and collided with a tree and the rider, a 45 year old man, sadly suffered serious injuries which proved to be fatal.

His next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specially-trained family liaison officers.

Sergeant Tim Davies, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit, said: "Our thoughts are very much with the family of the man who sadly lost his life, and we are conducting extensive enquiries to determine the circumstances of the collision.

"We are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision and has not yet spoken with police. Equally, if you have a working dash cam fitted to your vehicle and you were travelling along Anchor Lane at the time of the incident, we would like to hear from you."

You can email Sgt Davies at timothy.davies@herts.pnn.police.uk, report information online at herts.police.uk/report, talk to one of our Force Communication Room operators via web chat at herts.police.uk/contact, or call our emergency number 101 quoting reference **Operation Karela.**
