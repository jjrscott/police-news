* ### Did you witness a white BMW X5 driving erratically in Potters Bar?

A man has been arrested after a police pursuit in Potters Bar and now officers are appealing for information and witnesses.

Just after 10am today (Sunday 2 February) police were called to report that a man had acted aggressively in the BP garage on the High Street, before he left in a white BMW X5.

Officers attended the area and identified the vehicle before signalling for it to stop.

It failed to do so and a pursuit was carried out. The vehicle came to a stop on Darkes Lane where the driver was detained.

During the pursuit, the BMW collided with several vehicles belonging to members of the public.

Sergeant Martin Kemp, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit, said: "Thankfully no one was seriously injured as a result of this morning's incident and we are pleased that an arrest has been made. However a lot of damage has occurred to innocent people's vehicles.

"We have now launched an investigation and will be carrying out enquiries such as checking CCTV, however we are keen to speak to anyone who was travelling on foot or in a vehicle on the High Street, Darkes Lane or the surrounding area between 10.10am and 10.20am today.

"Did you witness a white BMW X5 driving in an erratic manner? Do you have a working dash cam fitted to your vehicle? Do you think you may have captured something of use to our investigation? If so, please get in touch."

If you have any information about the incident and have not yet spoken to us, please get in touch quoting ISR 189 of 2 February.
