* ## Residents reminded to keep homes secure and valuables out of sight this Christmas

 * ## Don't leave bags, purses or other valuables in your car

 * ## Follow our advice for a crime-free Christmas

Hertfordshire Constabulary would like to wish all residents in the county a merry, crime-free Christmas.

During December police are reminding residents to keep their homes and valuables secure by following some simple crime prevention tips to make sure everyone enjoys a wonderful Christmas.

Inspector Andrew Palfreyman, from Hertfordshire Constabulary's Crime Reduction Unit, said: "At this time of year everyone is busy buying gifts and preparing for Christmas. Criminals know that homes are full of gifts and will be on the lookout for opportunities to steal them. Leaving gifts in outbuildings or in cars makes them more accessible to thieves. If you leave anything valuable on view either at home or in the car, you may be presenting a thief with an opportunity."

 * Make sure you keep all your gifts in a secure place - don't leave them in the shed or garage, or on view near windows or doors.
 * Don't leave bags, purses or other valuables on view in your car.
 * Lock up when you leave - make sure all windows and doors are securely locked when you leave the house or go up to bed.
 * Security mark valuables and register them for free on www.immobilise.com _._
 * Security marking and registering your children's Christmas gifts will help to keep them safe and get them returned if they are lost or stolen.
 * When out shopping push your purse to the bottom of your bag and zip it securely, wallets should not be carried in back pockets.
 * Consider installing a door bell camera, internal camera and/or monitored burglar alarm.
 * Install 'dusk to dawn' external lighting and use timer switches in your home to control internal lights, radios and a simulated TV.
