Detectives are appealing for witnesses and information following a suspicious incident in Baldock during the early hours of today (Sunday 2 August).

Police were called at around 1.30am to report a disturbance involving a group of people and a possible collision, in Woodland Way.

Officers attended but those involved had left the area. A search was carried out but there was no sign of a collision or anyone having been injured.

A white van was however located, with damage to the tyres.

Detective Sergeant Will Ainsworth, from the North Herts Local Crime Unit, said: "We are currently working to gather evidence and information to establish the circumstances around what happened. At this time, no one has reported any injuries or disclosed any offences to us.

"If you witnessed the incident or have any information about what happened, please contact us."

You can report information online, speak to an operator in our Force Communications Room via our online web chat or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting ISR 102 of August 2.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form.

You can use our community voice platform 'echo' to let us know what you think we should be prioritising in your area. Your feedback will help towards shaping our local policing priorities, initiatives and campaigns.
