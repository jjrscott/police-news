The bad weather was snow problem for officers from the Chorleywood Safer Neighbourhood Team as they braved the cold conditions to hold a bike marking event at the weekend.

PCSOs Lauren Maberly, Jessica Hill and Steven Jacob marked around 30 bicycles in Lower Road on Saturday (March 17) and also issued crime prevention and safety advice to cyclists.

Details of the bikes were then registered on the online database immobilise.com so that they can be reunited with their owners if they are ever lost or stolen and subsequently recovered.

PCSO Lauren Maberly said: "Despite the terrible weather, we still had a good turn out on the day. Security marking your bike makes it safer. It not only helps police to reunite lost or stolen items with the owners, but also acts as a deterrent to thieves as bikes that are clearly security marked are far less attractive to criminals.

"We will be holding similar events in the coming months so keep an eye out for details.
