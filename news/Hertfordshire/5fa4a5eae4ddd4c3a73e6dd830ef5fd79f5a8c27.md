A 14-year-old girl from Letchworth has been charged in connection with three arsons which happened in recent weeks around the town.

On Sunday, January 28, police officers from Letchworth and Baldock Safer Neighbourhood Team were carrying out targeted patrols around Cowslip Hill in connection with the arsons. They spotted a girl who they believed appeared to be acting suspiciously and arrested her.

The girl was taken to Stevenage police station where she was charged in connection with three arsons. These include:

 * An incident in Rowland Way where a bin was set alight in a multi-storey car park on January 2.
 * An incident in Southfields where a bin was set alight behind a Nisa store on January 7.
 * An incident at the allotments in Cowslip Hill where a shed was set alight on January 28.

The girl was remanded and appeared at Hatfield Remand Court yesterday (January 29). She was released on bail with conditions, including a curfew, pending further investigations and is next due to appear at the youth court on February 1.Twelve additional arsons have happened around Letchworth during January. The incidents happened in Leys Avenue, Hawthorn Hill, Runnalow and the allotments on Bedford Road. **Sergeant Alan Clarke, who leads Letchworth and Baldock Safer Neighbourhood Team, said:** "We have been working closely with Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue in relation to this series of arsons to get to the bottom of who is responsible. Arson is an extremely serious offence which has the potential to put people's lives in serious danger and I would urge anyone with information about these offences to come forward as soon as possible."

Anyone with information is asked to contact the Letchworth and Baldock Safer Neighbourhood Team on the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference number G2/18/15. You can also report information online.

**Sergeant Clarke added:** "To protect your sheds, outbuildings and the outside of buildings from arson, I would recommend the public to consider the following fire safety advice:

 * don't stack flammable waste against or near your building, i.e. wood, cardboard, plastics, oils or bottles of gas
 * always store items in a large skip with metal covers or euro bins
 * gas bottles should be stored in locked metal cages, if possible, away from the building
 * oils and fuel, whether unused or not, should be stored in fire proof containers and made secure
 * avoid storing ignition and fuel sources together
 * consider security lighting and CCTV
 * lock gates and secure all vehicles when not in use."
