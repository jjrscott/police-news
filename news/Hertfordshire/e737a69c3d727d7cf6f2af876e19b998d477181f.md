Officers investigating an affray in Hatfield are appealing for information and witnesses.

It happened in Market Square at around 9.50am on Monday, June 25.

It was reported that two men had an altercation in the street, which moved from Market Square on to Queensway in the vicinity of The Town Inn pub.

PC Christopher Mobbs, who is investigating, said: "The incident happened in an area with a large footfall and a number of passing vehicles so I am certain that there would have been members of the public who saw what happened. Maybe you filmed it on your mobile phone? If so, we would be very keen to view that footage.

"If you witnessed the incident and have not yet spoken to police, please contact me by emailing christopher.mobbs@herts.pnn.police.uk, report information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report or call the non-emergency number 101 quoting crime reference 41/10936/18."

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.

 * A 22-year-old man from Hatfield has been arrested in connection with this incident and has been released under investigation.
