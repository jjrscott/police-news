A woman who pretended she had cancer to get money from her family members has been sentenced after being found guilty of fraud.

Ellen Danagher, aged 48 and of Elsons Mews in Welwyn Garden City, told her family in 2009 that she had bowel cancer and had been offered a new innovative treatment that she would have to pay for.

Three of her relatives gave her a total of £21,000 towards the treatment.

Several years later they became suspicious of Danagher and questioned whether the money had been used for cancer treatment.

They hired a private detective and established that a hospital letter regarding the medical treatment that Danagher had shown them was a fake. The family then contacted the police.

Following a trial at St Albans Crown Court on November 23, Danagher was found guilty of three counts of fraud by false representation.

Yesterday (Wednesday, November 19) she was sentenced to a total of 18 months in prison suspended for two years, 200 hours of unpaid work and must pay a £15 victim surcharge. Danagher must also pay back her relatives £1,200 each at £35 per month for three years
