Police have released images of two women they would like to speak to following a theft from a shop in Bishop's Stortford.

Shortly after 3pm on Saturday January 6, a gilet was taken from a rack in Joules in South Street by a woman. She placed the item in a bag and left the store without attempting to pay for it.

Officers have released images of the two women as they may have seen something or have information about the incident.

Anyone who recognises either of these women is asked to contact PCSO Adam Pemberton in the East Herts Safer Neighbourhood Team using the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference A2/18/29. Or you can report information online.

Alternatively, if you have any information about this incident you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
