Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a man who is wanted.

Charlie Brinkley, aged 22, is wanted in connection with breach of licence. He has connections with Welwyn Garden City and Northampton.

You can report information on his whereabouts online at herts.police.uk/report, speak to an operator in our Force Communications Room via our online web chat at herts.police.uk/contact or call the non-emergency number 101.

If you have seen him in the last few moments, call 999.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
