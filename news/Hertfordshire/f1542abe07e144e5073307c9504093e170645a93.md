At around 9.30am on Monday, January 21, a man was seen entering the front garden of a property in Longmead before taking a vacuum cleaner which was outside the front of the house behind a box.

The victim saw the man place the vacuum in the back of a white Mercedes 308D van, and after knocking on the van's window and questioning the man, he returned the vacuum and said he thought it was scrap.

The man and the driver of the white van then drove off.
