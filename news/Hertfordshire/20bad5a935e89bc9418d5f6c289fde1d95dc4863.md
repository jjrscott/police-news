Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a person who has gone missing from Hatfield.

Mohamed Belacem was last seen near to the De Havilland campus at the University of Hertfordshire around 11.30pm on Saturday, March 17.

He is described as tanned, around 5ft 8in tall and of medium build.

Mohamed was last seen wearing blue jeans, a blue hooded jacket, a blue baseball cap and grey trainers. He may also have two tattoos on the back of one of his hands.

It is believed he may have made his way to London and could possibly be staying in the areas of Victoria, Brixton and Edgware Road.

Officers are growing increasingly concerned for Mohamed's welfare. He has limited use of the English language.

Anyone who has seen Mohamed or who knows where he is should call Hertfordshire Constabulary's non-emergency number 101, quoting ISR 264 of March 18.
