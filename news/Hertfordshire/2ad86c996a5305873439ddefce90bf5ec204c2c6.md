Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a man who is wanted.

Umar Haq, aged 27 and whose last known address is Chelmsford Road, South Woodford in Redbridge, is wanted in connection with the theft of a vehicle in Purfleet, Essex on 17 July 2017.

He has links to Hertfordshire, Essex and London - in particular, Romford, Ilford and Plaistow.

Anyone who has seen Umar or knows of his whereabouts is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/report.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
