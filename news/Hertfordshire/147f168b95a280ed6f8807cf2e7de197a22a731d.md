Police are releasing a CCTV image of a man they would like to identify as part of their enquiries following the theft of post in Cuffley.

Just before 11.30am on January 15, a man removed a white envelope from an external post box at a property in Tolmers Road. Then just before 11am on January 18, a man was seen interfering with a private post box on a fence outside a property in the same road. It is suspected that he stole items from the post box.

Officers would like to speak to the man pictured as they believe he may be able to help them with their enquiries.
