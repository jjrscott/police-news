A Dispersal Notice will be enforced in Berkhamsted from 4pm today (October 31) to 4am tomorrow (Thursday, November 1).

The powers, under Section 35 of the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014, allow officers to order anyone to leave the area for a period of time up to a maximum of 48 hours if they have reasonable grounds to believe that person is committing or likely to commit anti-social behaviour, crime and disorder.

Officers can also give direction to a person aged under 16 to leave and can take them home or to a place of safety.

Under the Notice, any item that could be used to commit harassment, alarm or distress to members of the public can be confiscated.

Refusing to comply with a direction to leave is a criminal offence and can result in a maximum of three months in prison and a fine.

Inspector Jeff Scott, from the Dacorum Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "This Notice has been put in place following a number of incidents where young people have travelled from outside of the town into Berkhamsted to carry out anti-social behaviour and commit crimes.

"The bad behaviour of a few is having a negative impact on the local community so we're using these powers to proactively target potential offenders before incidents take place.

"This decision is not taken lightly however following a number of reports to police we believe this is a proportionate response and will enable us to positively tackle the problem."
