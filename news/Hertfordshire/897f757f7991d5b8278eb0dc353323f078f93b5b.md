Officers are appealing for information, witnesses and dash cam footage following a serious collision near Potters Bar yesterday (Sunday, June 9).

The incident happened at around 3.40am on the A1000/Barnet Road in Barnet, close to Wrotham Park, Potters Bar.

For reasons unknown at this stage, a black Mini Cooper left the road and collided with a fence and two trees.

The driver, a woman in her thirties, was taken to hospital with multiple serious injuries. She remains there in a serious condition.

Sergeant Martin Kemp, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit, said: "I am appealing for anyone who saw the collision, or the events leading up to the collision, to get in touch.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who might have captured what happened on dash cam footage.

"If you can help, please get in touch via 101 or email me at _martin.kemp@herts.pnn.police.uk_ , quoting ISR 116 of June 9."
