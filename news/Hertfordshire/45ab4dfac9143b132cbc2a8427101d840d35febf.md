Police are appealing for information and witnesses following an incident of assault in Stevenage.

At around 1.15am on Thursday, December 20, a man, aged in his 30s, was assaulted by three offenders in King George Playing Field, near the Aldi supermarket.

He suffered a broken nose, fractured cheek and broken eye socket.

Detective Constable Kirsty Richardson, who is investigating, said: "The victim has very little recollection about what happened to him so I'm appealing to anyone who may have been in the area around the time stated and believes they have information that could assist police to please get in touch."

Anyone with information can contact DC Richardson by emailing _Kirsty.richardson2@herts.pnn.police.uk_ , calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/68552/18 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report _._

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
