Detective Sergeant Annie Waylett, from the Hertsmere Local Crime Unit, said: "We do all we can to tackle burglary across Hertsmere and I would like to take this opportunity to remind residents of steps they can take to help make their homes more secure, especially while we are still in in the dark, winter months.

"Give your home a 'lived-in' look to help deter burglars. You can get timer switches to turn your lights on automatically to make it look like someone is in, and perhaps consider investing in a doorbell camera or a CCTV system - that way, if you unfortunately do become a victim, you will have footage to assist our investigation.

"If you do witness a burglary or suspect that one is in progress please call 999 straight away."

You can report information online, speak to an operator in our Force Communications Room via our online web chat or call the non-emergency number 101. If a crime is in progress or someone's life is in danger, call 999 immediately.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form.
