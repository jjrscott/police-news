Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a man who is wanted from Broxbourne.

Mark Gibbs, aged 48 from Plomer Avenue, Hoddesdon, is wanted in connection to an assault (ABH) which took place in the town.

He is believed to frequent the Broxbourne area.

Anyone who sees Mark or knows of his whereabouts is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/59467/19 or report information online.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form.
