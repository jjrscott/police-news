* ### Car thieves are using advanced technology to gain access to parked vehicles in St Albans.

 * ### Owners of keyless cars are advised to keep their fobs in a metal container such as a biscuit tin.

 * ### Motorists are also encouraged to use steering wheel locks to deter thieves.

 * ### There have been seven thefts of motor vehicles in the St Albans district between November 26 and December 9.

Car thieves are using advanced technology to steal new and valuable older cars across the St Albans district, which includes Harpenden and London Colney, in line with a national trend.

"We have doorbell video footage of a man with a laptop trying to steal a Mercedes from a driveway in Harpenden on two separate occasions over the last fortnight at around 3am," said St Albans Detective Inspector Alexandra Warwick. "He was clearly trying to connect to signals emitted by keyless car fobs. Fortunately he wasn't able to gain access because the owner had taken sensible precautions. Keyless cars are particularly vulnerable to theft as once the frequency to the fob is breached the car can be started at the push of a button.

"I strongly advise that motorists keep keys in a metal container such as a biscuit tin, fridge, or a Faraday bag (which is lined with metallic material) or even just wrap your keys in tin foil. You can also speak to your car manufacturer about unique crime prevention advice for your particular make of vehicle.

"I'd also encourage people to buy steering wheel locks as these act as a deterrent to car thieves."

There were seven thefts of motor vehicles between November 26 and December 9 in the St Albans district - five in St Albans, one in Harpenden and one in London Colney.

A variety of makes were stolen including a Nissan Micra, a Ford Fiesta and an electric Tesla car.

Det Insp Warwick added: "To help us reduce thefts from motor vehicles, please also make sure you lock your vehicle and double check by trying the door handles and make sure your windows are closed with property and any valuables removed."
