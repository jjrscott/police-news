Officers are releasing CCTV images of two people they would like to speak to after a purse was stolen in Hatfield.

Between 8.15pm and 8.23pm on Wednesday, August 1, a woman accidentally left her purse at one of the self-service tills inside the Co-op store in Bishops Rise.

The till was then used by other people who took the purse and left the store with it. The purse has not been handed into staff or the police.

PC Gav Richardson, who is investigating, said: "I'd like to speak to the man and the woman pictured here as I believe they may have information that can help with our enquiries."

Anyone who recognises the people pictured is asked to contact PC Richardson by emailing, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/23503/18, or report information online.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
