Police in Bishop's Stortford are appealing for help and information in order to trace two men they believe could assist them with their investigation into a theft from WH Smith in South Street.

On Friday January 19, at around 4.05pm, two men tried to remove a cash till from the back of the store. The till was not in use and did not contain any money at the time. The men were disturbed and promptly left the store.

Officers would like to speak to the men in the photos, as they believe they were in the store at the time and may have information which could help their inquiry.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact PC Steve Gent on 101 quoting crime reference number A2/18/114 or report information online.

Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or submit information through their anonymous online form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court.
