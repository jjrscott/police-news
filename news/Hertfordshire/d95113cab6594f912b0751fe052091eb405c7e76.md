* ## "Invest in a steering lock" is the advice from the St Albans district Detective Inspector following the theft of Ford Transits and Ford Fiestas in St Albans and Harpenden recently.

 * ## We believe the offenders are using a master key to gain access to Ford Transits which has become a national issue.

 * ## Report any suspicious incidents - if you see a crime in progress, dial 999 - look out for your neighbours, invest in doorbell cameras or CCTV and join Neighbourhood Watch via the Online Watch Link at www.owl.co.uk."

"Invest in a steering lock" is the advice from the St Albans district Detective Inspector following the theft of Ford Transits and Ford Fiestas in St Albans and Harpenden recently.

Detective Inspector Alex(andra) Warwick said: "We believe the offenders are using a master key to gain access to Ford Transits which has become a national issue. We have also seen a rise in the thefts of Ford Fiestas. We will be working with the manufacturers locally, but I'd encourage owners to buy a steering lock to help reduce the chance of their vehicle being stolen. If possible, park your car in a garage or in a well-lit area."

_A Ford Transit was stolen from Abbey Avenue between 10am on February 6 and 6am yesterday (February 7)._

_A red Ford Fiesta was stolen from the Ridgeway between 7.55pm and 9.55pm on January 29._

_A black Ford Fiesta was stolen from Charmouth Road on January 29._

She said: "I'd also encourage residents to report any suspicious incidents - if you see a crime in progress, dial 999 - look out for your neighbours, invest in doorbell cameras or CCTV and join Neighbourhood Watch via the Online Watch Link at www.owl.co.uk."
