Officers are appealing for witnesses and information following a robbery in Hertsmere.

On Thursday 17 September at around 1.45pm, the victim was cycling through the underpass underneath the M1, between Falcon Way, Watford and School Lane, in Bricket Wood when he was approached by two men, who threatened him and stole his bicycle.

They have been described as two white men, one of whom was fair skinned and the other more tanned. They were both said to be wearing surgical style face masks, with distinctive graphics on which made it look as though the masks had teeth. Both males were wearing dark tracksuits.

Detective Constable Erik Gale, who is investigating, said: "The victim has understandably been left distressed following this incident. The suspects were wearing incredibly distinctive face coverings - it is likely that if you have seen them, you would recall it. If you believe you might have witnessed the incident, or if you think you may have seen two men near the area matching this description, please get in contact as soon as possible.

"The bicycle that has been stolen has several distinguishing features - the frame is neon green, black and silver, and it has the word 'PHOENIX' written in capital letters across the side. If you have seen the bicycle, or perhaps been offered it for sale, please get in touch with me."

Anyone with information is asked to contact DC Gale directly via email at erik.gale@herts.pnn.police.uk.
