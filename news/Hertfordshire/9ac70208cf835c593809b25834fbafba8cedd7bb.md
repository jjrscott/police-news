Five people were taken to hospital for treatment, but their injuries are not deemed to be life-threatening.

Enquiries are being carried out to establish the circumstances around the collision.

Detective Sergeant Ian Siggery said: "We are appealing for anyone who witnessed the collision, or the events leading up to it, to please get in touch. We'd particularly like to hear from anyone who may have captured dash cam footage of what happened."

You can report information online, speak to an operator in our Force Communications Room via online web chat or call our non-emergency number 101 quoting ISR 177 of 31 December.

As per standard procedure, the incident has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), due to prior police interaction with the vehicle.
