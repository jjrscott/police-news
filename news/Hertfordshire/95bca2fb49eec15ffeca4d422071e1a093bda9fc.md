Residents are invited to share their suggestions on the issues that police in Welwyn Hatfield should be prioritising over the next few months.

The Welwyn Hatfield Safer Neighbourhood Team will be holding a priority setting forum on Wednesday 18 September to discuss the pressing issues in Welwyn Hatfield and which should be prioritised over the next three months, working alongside partners within the Community Safety Partnership (CSP).

The Welwyn Hatfield CSP is made up of representatives from the responsible authorities, including police, the local council, fire and rescue, probation and health. The priority setting forum will be led by Inspector Wayne Nash from the Welwyn Hatfield Safer Neighbourhood team, and attended by local councillors and public body representatives.

For the first time, the Constabulary will be live-streaming the meeting on Twitter so that members of the public can watch online. In addition, Welwyn Hatfield residents will be able to submit questions online to Inspector Nash throughout the meeting.

Inspector Wayne Nash said: "I want to make sure that the public's voice is heard when we decide on the next set of policing priorities.

"I would encourage any Welwyn Hatfield residents who are going to watch the meeting on Wednesday, to interact with us and submit your views so that we can discuss them.

"To submit your views while you watch, visit slido.com and enter WELHAT1809. Simply choose the area you live in (maps attached) and then put your street name or ward before your question or comment.

"Submissions can be entered anonymously and you don't have to wait until Wednesday to submit your views as they can also be submitted in advance.

"I look forward to hearing from as many Welwyn Hatfield residents as possible and working with you and your local councillors to help fix the issues that matter most to you."

**The live-stream will start at** **7pm at on Wednesday 18 September on the Herts Police Twitter page: twitter.com/hertspolice.**
