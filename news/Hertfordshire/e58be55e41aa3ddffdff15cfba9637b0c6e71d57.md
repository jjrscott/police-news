Police are releasing an image of a man they would like to speak to for help with their enquiries following a distraction theft in Bishop's Stortford.

The incident occurred in Waitrose car park, between noon and 12.30pm on Tuesday, February 26.

A woman was unloading her shopping when she was approached by a man who informed her that someone had damaged her vehicle.

As she walked round to check, the man walked off. No damage was found and the woman drove home, where she then realised her purse was missing from the front passenger seat.

Officers would like to speak with the man pictured as he may have information which could assist the investigation.

Anyone who recognises him should contact PCSO Pemberton via email to _adam.pemberton@herts.pnn.police.uk_ or by calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime number 41/18702/19. You can also report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report _._

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.

For over 30 years, Crimestoppers has always kept its promise of anonymity to everyone who contacts them.

PCSO Adam Pemberton said: "We would always advise people to ensure they do not leave personal belongings, such as handbags, mobile phones and purses, unattended - especially in busy shopping areas. It takes just seconds for an opportunist thief to strike.

"If you are approached in similar circumstances, please remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to police."
