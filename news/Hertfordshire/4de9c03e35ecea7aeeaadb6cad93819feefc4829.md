Detectives are appealing for information following an assault in Letchworth and are particularly keen to trace a member of the public who came to assist the victim.

The incident occurred near the war memorial in Station Parade, during the early hours of Saturday, October 6.

A man aged in his 20s sustained significant facial injuries after he intervened in an altercation between a group of unknown males.

Investigator Maurice Burton, from the Hitchin Local Crime Unit, said: "The victim was assisted by a man who helped him to get home. We are keen to trace this person as he may have information that could assist our enquiries.

"I would also like to hear from anyone else who may have witnessed the incident or events leading up to it. If you have any information at all, please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to email or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/44331/18. You can also report information online.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
