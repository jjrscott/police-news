* ### Officers stopped a man while on proactive patrol.

 * ### A large knife was recovered by officers.

 * ### Police are continuing to crack down on knife crime.

A man has been charged after a large knife was recovered by police on a proactive burglary patrol in Croxley Green yesterday (February 22).

Officers from the Scorpion team stopped a man in Barton Way Park who then allegedly ran off before being detained.

A large hunting style knife was subsequently located and an arrest was made.

Three Rivers Chief Inspector Nick Lillitou said: "In response to an increase in knife related crime, Hertfordshire Constabulary took part in a national amnesty last week which saw 160 knives surrendered across the county. However, while incidents remain very low in Three Rivers, our work to tackle knife crime is continuing. Going forward, we will be working to raise awareness and educate young people about the dangers of carrying knives."

 * Kalim Khan, aged 18, from Grove Crescent, Croxley Green, has been charged with being in possession of a bladed article. He has been bailed to appear before Central West Herts Magistrates on March 16.
