A knife has been seized by police after being found discarded under a van in South Oxhey.

Officers from the Safer Neighbourhood and Scorpion teams were on patrol in the South Oxhey Parade area when they came across a group of males acting suspiciously, late on Wednesday afternoon (January 9).

As they approached the group, they fled the area, with one of the males discarding an object.

This was recovered by officers and was discovered to be a large knife.

PC Honor Greaves, from the Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "Thanks to the vigilance of officers on patrol, a dangerous weapon has been taken off our streets and our work is now continuing to trace those involved.

"Dealing with violent crime is a priority for the police and we are working closely with partner agencies to educate people around the dangers of carrying a weapon. We want to send a clear message that carrying a knife is illegal and extremely dangerous; you are not only putting yourself at risk but could also face a prison sentence if caught."
