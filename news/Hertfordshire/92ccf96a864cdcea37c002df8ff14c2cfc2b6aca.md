 * ### Victims can contact the service direct without any contact with police.

An award-winning centre that provides support to sexual assault victims was visited by Hertfordshire's Chief Constable and Deputy Police and Crime Commissioner on Monday (November 27).

Herts SARC's Independent Sexual Violence Advisor (ISVA) team recently received national recognition at the LimeCulture Limelight Awards. To mark the award, Chief Constable Charlie Hall and Deputy PCC David Gibson visited the centre where the pair learned more about their work and congratulated the team on their prize.

Charlie Hall said: "I was pleased to be able to visit Herts SARC and see first-hand the service they offer to those affected by rape or sexual assault in Hertfordshire.

"It is excellent news that this work has been recognised at a national level. I hope this will give confidence and reassurance to victims who may not want to go to police, but who still want access to support."

David Gibson said: "I'd like to congratulate the team on their hard work and am pleased to see them getting the national recognition they deserve. The ISVA team support some of the most vulnerable people in society and are fantastic at what they do.

"The SARC is an important facility and people should be confident they will receive impartial and independent support, regardless of whether they have reported an incident to the police."

Herts SARC manager Sandra Lewin said: "We have seen a considerable increase in the number of referrals recently - my whole team have worked endlessly to support those cases. I am proud of the team and pleased they've been recognised for their continued hard work."

Herts SARC's ISVA team received the 'Exceptional Team' award at the third National ISVA Conference. Judges commented that they were "high-performing and making a real impact in their local community".

The team is made up of four ISVAs. It has seen a considerable increase in the numbers of referrals in recent times. July this year was their busiest ever month with 56 cases referred to them.

Herts SARC is managed by Mountain Healthcare and jointly commissioned by the Constabulary and NHS England. It offers free support and practical help to anyone in Hertfordshire who has experienced sexual abuse or sexual violence through the ISVAs and its helpline.

Anyone affected by rape or sexual assault can contact Herts SARC's 24/7 helpline 0808 178 4448 for access to help and support or visit .
