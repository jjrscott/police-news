* ## Local residents have their say.

 * ## OWL and echo survey results analysed.

 * ## Rural Hitchin Safer Neighbourhood Team set new policing priorities.

With the help of local residents, the Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT) in rural Hitchin have now set their new policing priorities for the next three months.

The SNT is responsible for dealing with short and long-term neighbourhood issues, such as anti-social behaviour and criminal damage, and they work with local partners, including North Herts District Council, to ensure that the rural areas surrounding Hitchin, are safe places to live and work.

Prior to setting the new priorities, the team ran a feedback campaign in which local residents were encouraged to submit their views on what issues their local officers should focus on. They did this via OWL - the Constabulary's online watch link and via echo, the new community voice platform.

After analysing the feedback, the following priorities have been set and the dedicated Hitchin Rural team of PCs and PCSOs will be working to address them:

 * #### Drug use and anti-social behaviour in and around recreation grounds and playing fields in the rural communities.

 * #### Speeding - specifically through Kings Walden, Breachwood Green, Kimpton and Whitwell.

 * #### Re-launching Operation Astare which focuses on damage to farm land caused by vehicles driving over crops, seed beds and sites of special scientific interest, poaching and hare coursing.

Safer Neighbourhood Sergeant Guy Westwood said: "These are the issues that matter most to local residents and I would like to thank them for taking the time in sharing their concerns with us. It's really useful to understand what issues are really affecting their lives, so we can tailor our patrol plans to tackle these as priorities.

"These priorities will be reviewed again in three months, but in the meantime, you can still provide us with feedback using echo. Simply go to echo, Hitchin rural and have your say. It's important to note that some comments we receive are about things that aren't police matters, such as parking and litter, however we do pass these comments to our partner agencies, such as North Herts District Council so that they are aware and can look to tackle them."
