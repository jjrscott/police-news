Two men have been arrested, charged and remanded for conspiracy to commit 21 burglaries including offences in Potters Bar and Bushey.

Gavin Prentice, age 23, of no fixed abode and Myles Moorhouse, age 28, of Chadwell Heath in Romford have been charged with the burglaries in Hertfordshire, Essex and London between January 3, 2017 and November 24, 2017.

The Hertsmere offences include a burglary on 17 February 2017 in Northlands in Potters Bar and Clays Lane in Bushey Heath on 24, March 2017.

They have been remanded in custody and are due before Uxbridge Crown Court at a date to be set.

Hertsmere Chief Inspector Steve O'Keeffe said: "My team of detectives worked hard to secure a complex conspiracy charge for these offenders. My message is clear - we will relentlessly hunt down burglars and will continue to pursue you long after the offences, as reflected in these charges for offences committed last year in Hertsmere."
