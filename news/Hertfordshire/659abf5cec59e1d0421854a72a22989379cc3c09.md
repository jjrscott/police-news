Over 200 young people at Hertswood Academy in Borehamwood were given an insight into the dangers and consequences of knife crime on Wednesday (February 6).

The event for Year 9 pupils was hosted by the Borehamwood and Elstree Safer Neighbourhood Team with Hertfordshire Fire & Rescue Service, St Giles Trust and The Josh Hanson Trust*. The day received funding from Hertsmere Borough Council.

PCSO Callum Ellis said: "Although we don't have a problem with knife crime in Borehamwood, we felt it was important to arm our young people with the real consequences about knife crime.

"The pupils were spoken to by Tracey Hanson whose son died in a stabbing three years ago. She shared her heart felt story and there was not a dry eye in the room. They were then joined by Patrick Boyce who told his story. His son was stabbed and survived, but now needs 24/7 care, he cannot speak or move and now lives in a hospice. I think these real stories had a big impact on the young people and we hope it may, quite literally, save a life."

The students were given a lesson in emergency first aid from Borehamwood fire officers. The St Giles Trust ended the day talking about county drug lines, gangs and grooming.

Loran Kingston, Community Safety Intervention Officer for Hertsmere Borough Council, said: "We are working with our police colleagues and others in the Community Safety Partnership to try to raise awareness of the dangers of knife crime and getting involved in county lines and gangs across the borough.
