"The many years that he has avoided the police have been a constant reminder of Paul's death. We have been at court listening throughout the trial and we now have many questions that were unanswered, answered.

"We would like to thank the police for the hard work and efforts put in over the years. The determination to locate and arrest Justin Clarke has been very impressive and we are very grateful. The result provides justice for our family."
