Police are appealing for information and witnesses following a collision in Hitchin.

Between 4.30am and 5am on Sunday, October 14, it is alleged that a silver Ford KA was taken without consent from Radcliffe Road before colliding with parked vehicles in Dacre Road.

A 26 year old man from Hitchin has been arrested on suspicion of aggravated taking a vehicle without consent (TWOC) and drink-driving. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

PC Tim Houssein, who is investigating, said: "I'm appealing to anyone who saw the collision to get in touch by emailing, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/46179/18 or report information online.

"If you'd prefer to provide information anonymously call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or submit details online."
