Police have released CCTV images of three men they would like to identify following criminal damage to a taxi in Hatfield.

At around 12.15am on Monday 22 June a grey Toyota Avensis was damaged in Clarkes Road.

The people in the images were in the area at the time and could assist with enquiries.

PC Mike Thomas, who is investigating, said: "Unfortunately the CCTV images are not the clearest, but I am hoping that they may jog memories or may look familiar to someone who knows them or who saw them in the Hatfield area.
