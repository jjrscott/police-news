We were called just before 7pm yesterday (Friday, June 15) to Verulamium Park, St Albans.

Upon arrival officers established that an altercation had taken place between two groups and a 16 year old boy had suffered an injury to his abdomen.

The air ambulance attended and the teenager was taken to hospital where he remains in a stable condition.

Investigations are continuing at this time.

Chief Inspector Stuart Orton said: "I understand that news of this will have caused concern among the local community.

"I would like to reassure you that we believe this is an isolated incident involving young people who are known to each other and significant enquiries are on-going by officers to identify those responsible."

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/8052/18 or report information online at https://www.herts.police.uk/Report.
