Officers are appealing for information and witnesses following the theft of a caravan on the outskirts of Tring.

At around 4.13am on Tuesday December 4, a new Lunar Delta Ti caravan, which is less than a year old, was stolen from Coppice Farm Park, St Leonards.

PCSO Jake Smith said: "This theft occurred close to the Hertfordshire border near Tring and Aston Clinton. The tracker signal was lost on Newground Road near to Cow Roast in Hertfordshire, so the stolen caravan may be in the county."

"If you have information about the incident, please get in touch with me through email at _jake.smith@herts.pnn.police.uk_ or on the non-emergency number 101."

PCSO Smith added: "We recommend securing your caravan using a wheel clamp or installing bollards/posts on your driveway to secure the caravan. Also, put a cover over your caravan to make it less appealing to passers-by."
