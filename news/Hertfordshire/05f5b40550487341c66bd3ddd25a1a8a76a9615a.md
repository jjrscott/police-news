As Ramadan draws to a close, Chief Constable Charlie Hall QPM has given a message.

Chief Constable Charlie Hall said: "As I write this, we're now in the last few days of Ramadan, with Eid al-Fitr taking place this weekend.

"The very spirit of Eid is centred on the community - coming together to pray, visiting family and friends. I know that the mosques being closed has been problematic for the Muslim community this year. Just as Ramadan hasn't been without its challenges, the festival of Eid will be equally as difficult. It will mean not being able to celebrate outside your homes or to embrace all your loved ones, whilst we likewise recognise that some will sadly also be grieving.

"Despite all the obvious difficulties though I'm delighted to say that the community, not unexpectedly, has very much risen to the challenge this year and remained at home, observing Government advice. I anticipate that Eid will be no different.

"On behalf of the Constabulary, can I take this opportunity to wish all our Muslim residents an Eid Mubarak."
