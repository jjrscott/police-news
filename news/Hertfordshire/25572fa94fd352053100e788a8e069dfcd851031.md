Officers investigating reports of assault in Watford town centre are appealing for witnesses to get in touch.

At around 4.15am on Sunday, February 3, three people - two men and a woman - were the victims of assault in Market Street.

The trio were walking along the street when they were assaulted.

One of the male victims suffered a fractured left cheek bone and fractured nose, while the other man suffered facial injuries. The woman victim was punched in the face by one of the offenders causing pain.

Detective Constable Jennifer Stoddart, who is investigating, said: "I'm appealing for a family who were waiting at a nearby bus stop and may have seen the incident to get in touch.

"I'd also like to hear from the taxi driver who took the victims to hospital as he may have information that could help our enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact DC Stoddart by emailing jennifer.stoddart@herts.pnn.police.uk, calling the non-emergency number 101 quoting crime reference 41/10991/19 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, you can stay anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
