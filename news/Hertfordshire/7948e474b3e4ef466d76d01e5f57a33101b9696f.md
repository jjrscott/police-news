Officers have released CCTV images of a woman they would like to speak to in connection with an assault in St Albans.

Sometime between 11.05pm and 11.23pm on Saturday, February 2, an altercation broke out between a woman and a group of people in the Slug and Lettuce bar on Victoria Street.

During the incident, glass was thrown causing a woman to sustain a severe gash to the forehead, which required hospital treatment.

Officers are keen to speak to the woman pictured as they believe she may have information which could help the investigation.
