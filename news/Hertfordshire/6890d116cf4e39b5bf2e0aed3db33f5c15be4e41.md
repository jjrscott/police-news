Police are releasing a CCTV image of a woman they would like to identify as part of their enquiries following a distraction theft in Cuffley.

At around 11.50am on Wednesday, February 13, the offender asked a member of staff at The Orchid florist and cafe in Station Road for a drink from the fridges behind him. As he got her the drink she took his mobile phone from behind the counter.

Officers would like to speak to the woman pictured as they believe she may have information that can assist their investigation.

Anyone who recognises her or has information that could assist police is asked to contact PC Jessica Gibbs by emailing jessica.gibbs@herts.pnn.police.uk, calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/14419/19 or online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, you can stay anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
