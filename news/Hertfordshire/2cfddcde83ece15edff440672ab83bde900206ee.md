Officers are appealing for information and witnesses following a burglary and arson at Jungle Mania soft play centre in Gosling Sports Park, Stanborough Road, Welwyn Garden City.

Between 5.50pm and 6.05pm on Monday, April 1, a group of teenagers gained access to the creche area of Jungle Mania before setting alight to some netting and stealing drinks. Officers attended the scene but the group had left the area.

The offenders are described as two teenage girls and five or six teenage boys, all white and aged around 13 to 14 years old. They were wearing tracksuits with shoulder bags.

PC Callum Walford, who is investigating, said: "Thankfully the fire was able to be put out using a fire extinguisher but this reckless action could have had very serious, or even fatal, consequences.

"This sort of anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.

"I am appealing for anyone who saw what happened or anyone who saw suspicious activity in the area at the time to get in touch.

"If you have information that could help, please call the non-emergency number 101 or email me quoting crime reference 41/29870/19."

You can also report information online.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form.
