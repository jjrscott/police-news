Officers are appealing for the public's help in tracing a man who is wanted.

31 year old Stuart Remer, whose last known address is Old Vicarage Road, Harwich, Essex, is wanted for failing to appear at Stevenage Magistrates' Court on Thursday, October 25 in connection with criminal damage.

He has links to Hertford and it is believed that he might be in London.

Anyone who has seen Stuart or knows of his whereabouts is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101, quoting warrant reference 41/1488/18 or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court
