Officers investigating reports of a potential suspicious vehicle in Welwyn Garden City and Hertford are appealing for anyone with information to get in contact.

The vehicle was parked in a car park in The Vineyard, Welwyn Garden City on January 14, January 21 and January 28.

At around 8.40pm to 8.45pm on the three occasions, the car was seen in the car park with lights on and the engine running. It has also been seen driving into the car park and immediately leaving.

The same person also reported a suspicious vehicle with headlights on in Duncombe Road, Hertford on February 5 and February 7 at around the same time, and which is believed to be the same white car on both occasions.

No one was seen to get into or out of the vehicle on any occasion.
