Officers are appealing for information and witnesses following a burglary at a Honda garage in Letchworth.

The incident happened at the garage in Norton Way North on Thursday, October 11.

Shortly before midnight, a red Honda motorcycle and an African Twin Honda motorcycle were taken from the premises.

They were loaded into a vehicle, believed to be a Ford Transit van or similar, which then made off in the direction of the town centre.

The van is believed to have travelled to the Honda garage via Icknield Way past the Esso garage.

PC Lee Jessup, who is investigating, said: "I am appealing for anyone who saw what happened or has information about the burglary to get in touch.

"If you think you saw suspicious activity in the area around the time, please also get in touch. Any information, no matter how small it might seem, could be vital in the investigation.

"We understand that a pedestrian and a cyclist travelled past the garage at the time of the burglary, and I would particularly like to hear from them as they may have seen or heard suspicious activity.

"If you can help, please call the non-emergency number 101 or email me at _Lee.Jessup2@herts.pnn.police.uk_ quoting crime reference 41/45410/18."
