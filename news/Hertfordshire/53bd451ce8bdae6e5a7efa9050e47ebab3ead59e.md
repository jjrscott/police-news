Police investigating an assault in Welwyn are appealing for witnesses and information.

The incident occurred on the Great North Road (B197), near the junction with The Avenue, at around 11am on Friday, 19 July.

The male drivers of two vehicles were reportedly involved in an altercation, before one of them was allegedly punched to the face and struck to the groin, causing him to fall to the floor and hit his head.

PC Ben Swapp, who is investigating, said: "The victim required hospital treatment for his injuries and has been left severely shaken by what happened.

"Due to the time of day the incident occurred, I believe there may have been witnesses to what happened. If you were in the area at the time and have information which could assist our enquiries, please get in touch. I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have captured dash cam footage of the incident, or events leading up it."

Anyone with information should contact PC Swapp via email or by calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime number 41/65589/19. You can also report information online or speak to an operator in our Force Communications Room via our online web chat, which can be launched here.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form.

 * A 45-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
