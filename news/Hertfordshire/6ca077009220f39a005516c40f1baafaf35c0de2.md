Officers have released a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to following a burglary in Hatfield.

Between 7pm and 8pm on Monday, March 25, an offender gained entry to a property in Onslow Close and took a Samsung Galaxy mobile phone and more than Â£100 in cash.

Detective Constable David Johnson, from the Welwyn Hatfield Local Crime Unit, said: "We believe that the man pictured may have been in the area at the time and could have vital information that will assist the investigation.

"If you recognise him, please get in touch through the non-emergency number 101 quoting crime reference 41/28049/19.

"I would also like to hear from anyone who saw the burglary, or anyone who believes they might have been offered the phone for sale. If you think you can help, please don't hesitate to get in touch."
