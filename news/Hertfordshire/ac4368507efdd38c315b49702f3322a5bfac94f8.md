The following police constable and member of the public received the Chief Constable Commendation for Bravery Award:

 * Police Constable Joanna Witkiewicz, **who is based at Watford.**

On September 19, 2018, Joanna was off duty in **Stevenage**. On approaching a cycle path she heard a commotion and people shouting "Run, run, he has a knife. **"** She then saw three men arguing. Two of the men had large pieces of wood in their hands.

The third man was holding two weapons - a metal bar and a knife. The men holding the pieces of wood approached the third man, and fearing serious immediate harm Joanna declared herself a police officer and shouted at them to "drop the weapons."

The first two men manoeuvred and stood still behind Joanna. The third man began running towards them all waving their weapons. Joanna grabbed his t shirt and tackled him to the ground. After a struggle and violently kicking Joanna he managed to get up and run off.

Police received several calls in relation to this disturbance which additionally evidences the serious nature of what occurred. The third man was subsequently identified, arrested and charged with public order, affray and possession of a bladed article.

 * Member of the public Clive Miles, **who is from Radlett.**

On November 7, 2018, two police constables were on duty in **Watford** when they responded to a report of a naked man walking along the A41. On being approached by the officers he became extremely violent, punching and kicking them. It was clear he was under the influence of drugs causing Acute Behavioural Disorder which can increase a person's physical strength and ability and reduce their pain threshold.

They managed somehow to take the man to the ground where he continued to be violent and aggressive. They were in a highly visible area and whilst some members of the public shouted and laughed as they walked by, this was not the case when Clive Miles saw what was occurring.

Clive was driving when he realised the officers were struggling with this violent drug induced man. He stopped so suddenly it caused a puncture to his car tyre on the kerb! He ran to the officer's aid and being an ex-police officer he instinctively knew what he could do to help. He lay his body across the suspect's legs to help prevent the man's continued kicking towards the officers.

Clive was a significant help in preventing further assault on the police officers and potential serious harm. He was injured himself from being kicked in his head but he never gave up helping. Once the man was restrained Clive was also taken to hospital for treatment.

 * Annie-Laure Promonet, **who is from Watford**.

On July 22, 2017, Annie-Laure returned home to find a burglar trying to flee with her property. She instinctively grabbed the bag he was stealing and this resulted in a struggle between her and the man. Annie-Laure was thrown to the floor but did not let go, showing great courage.

She knew if she scratched the offender somehow she would secure his DNA. This was not an easy task, as during the struggle he picked up a glass bottle and hit her several times with the bottle on the back of her head.

She _still_ managed to recover her laptop from him and sit on it. She also, remarkably scratched his neck securing vital evidence. On top of all that, she went to great lengths to memorise his clothing. At this point he gave up and ran off.

On arrival, police were able to secure the DNA evidence which subsequently provided a match to the suspect.

He was located, arrested, charged and remanded by the courts, pleading guilty to burglary and assault at St Albans Crown Court. Annie-Laure was awarded Â£350 for her bravery.

The offender went on to admit another 18 dwelling burglaries in Hertfordshire, mostly in and around Watford. He received a seven and a half year sentence.

 * Lee Ascott, **who is from Harpenden.**

On August 21, 2018 PCSO Daniel Urquhart was called to an incident at the Maltings Shopping Centre in St Albans. On arrival a man informed him he had been the victim of an assault. The man smelt of cannabis and a member of the public handed the officer a bag that had been dropped by the man which clearly had a large quantity of cannabis inside it.

The man was asked by PCSO Urquhart to remain a there with him while he radioed for support. As he did this the man ran off in an attempt to escape.

The man was chased by the officer onto London Road then into Marlborough Road. At this point, Lee Ascott witnessed the chase. The man turned into an alleyway to continue his escape only to find Lee blocking his path with his arms wide and refusing to let the man get past him.

Although he was unaware what the man had done, or if he had any weapons on him, Lee wanted to assist the officer in detaining him. The man continued to try and escape and with no thought for his personal safety Lee grabbed the man and held onto him to prevent further escape.

He did so until PCSO Urqhart and two other police officers were able to arrest and secure the man. The man was subsequently cautioned with drugs possession.

 * Josh Lilley, **who is from Hatfield**.

On December 1, 2018 Police Constables Matthew Howell and Laura Frelford were on patrol in Cavendish Way, Hatfield when they saw a man being supported on the floor by a member of public - Josh Lilley.

The officers stopped to assist and as they did so were made aware on their radios that someone matching the man's description had recently tried to commit suicide from the Galleria, Hatfield.

The officers spoke with both Josh and the man to establish the circumstances and the man's welfare. Josh explained to the officers he had been out for a jog when he had spotted the man standing on a concrete wall of the over bridge to the A1(M).

He approached the man calmly to try and talk to him and as he did so the man stepped over the railings on top of the wall, in an effort to jump off and take his life.

In immediate response to this Josh, at great risk to himself, struggled with the man, taking him by the arm and managing to pull the man back over and down to safety.

Josh then restrained the man for his own safety whilst another member of the public called the police. As a result of the incident the man was seen by the mobile triage nurse and taken to hospital for further help with his mental health.

The following officers received a Chief Constable's Commendation award:

 * Inspector Ian Grout, **based at** **Watford** on Local Policing Command Operational Support Group. Ian is aged 50 and lives in Hemel Hempstead.
 * Police Constable Peter Lea, **based at Hertford** on Local Policing Command Investigation. Peter is aged 38 and lives in Biggleswade.
 * Detective Constable Christopher Dale, **based at Hatfield** on Local Policing Command Specialist Investigation Team. Christopher lives in Stevenage.

Operation Zetec was an operation to execute a warrant under the Firearms Act. The male subject of the operation had come to the attention of Counter Terrorism due to articles he had bought online. These included chemicals, hardware and tools to improvise a viable explosive device, mirroring the device used in the Manchester Arena attack.

The operation saw Operational Support Group officers, Authorised Firearms Officers, Police Search Teams and Local Policing Command support deployed as well as many staff from other agencies.

It was clear from the information and developing intelligence that the man had clear capability, equipment and intent. Due to the threat, harm and risk posed, this was a fast time policing operation.

The professionalism and resilience of the teams ensured a timely and safe arrest. The search recovered firearms, pre-cursor chemicals and items acquired to improvise an explosive device. Officers additionally recovered a recognised terrorism manual which proved to be a vital piece of evidence to enable the Crown Prosecution Service to support terrorism charges.

The man was charged with 13 offences under the Firearms Act, Explosive Substances Act and Misuse of Drugs Act and was convicted on all counts resulting in a 15 year prison sentence.
