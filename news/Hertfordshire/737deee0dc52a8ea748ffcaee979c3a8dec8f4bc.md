* ### People in Berkhamsted are being urged to be vigilant following a distraction theft.

Police are appealing for information and are urging people to be vigilant following a distraction theft in Berkhamsted.

Between 4.05pm and 4.25pm on Wednesday (February 6) a man was reversing his car into his garage in Doctors Common Road when he was approached by two men.

They said there was an issue with the rear of his vehicle and asked the victim - a man aged in his 70s - to open his bonnet. While he was distracted one of the offenders removed the victim's wallet from his pocket and took his credit card before leaving.

The victim later discovered that his bank card had been used to withdraw hundreds of pounds in cash.

Inspector Jeff Scott, from the Dacorum Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "I'm appealing for anyone who witnessed this incident or saw two men acting suspiciously in the area around the times stated to please get in touch.

"If you believe you may have been approached by these offenders and have not already called police, please contact us as soon as possible.

"I'm urging people to remain vigilant. If you're approached by individuals who you don't know, be wary and make sure your belongings are secure, politely decline any offers of help and contact police as soon as possible.

"Descriptions of the offenders and details of any vehicles, including their direction of travel, would help us identify the people responsible, so please if possible and safe to do so make a note of these details."

Anyone with information about Wednesday's incident is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary online or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/12089/19.

Alternatively, you can stay 100 per cent anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form.
