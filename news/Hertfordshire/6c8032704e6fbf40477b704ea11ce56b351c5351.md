* ### Arrests made after call about suspicious activity

 * ### Officers stopped a vehicle on the A1M

 * ### Two men in custody on suspicion of theft

Two men have today been arrested following reports of a van seen in suspicious circumstances in Buntingford this morning (23rd February).

Police were called to Barleycroft at 10.20am reporting a van driving slowly around residential streets.

Officers deployed to the area, located the van and followed it before being able to stop it on the A1M near to Stevenage with thanks to colleagues from the Beds, Cambs and Herts Road Policing Unit. Two men, aged in their 20s, were arrested on suspicion of theft and have been taken to custody.

Inspector Martin May said: "There have been a number of reports to police this month of a similar van acting in similar circumstances where people from the van have stolen items from skips and from driveways in North Herts, East Herts and Stevenage. We believe these incidents may be linked.

"I would like to reassure residents we take reports of this seriously and will do all we can to ensure the matters are investigated fully."
