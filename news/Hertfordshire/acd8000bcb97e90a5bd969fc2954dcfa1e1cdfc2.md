Officers in Hemel Hempstead have been granted authorisation to stop and search members of the public suspected to be carrying knives from 3.15pm until 11.59pm today (Friday, March 29), under Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.

The areas that the Section 60 applies to are:

 * In the north west corner of Adeyfield Road junction with Longlands, heading south along Longlands to the junction with and including St. Albans Road.
 * In the north east corner of Adeyfield Road junction with Leverstock Green Road, south to the junction with St. Albans Road.

A dispersal order has also been authorised for these areas which will run simultaneously with the Section 60. This means that anyone found gathering in the area can be directed to leave and prevented from returning until tomorrow.

A Section 60 temporarily gives additional powers to police officers, which allow them to stop and search anyone in a particular area for a set period of time, without the officers requiring reasonable grounds to do so.

They are different to the stop and search powers they already have, which can be used at any time and - when used - do require reasonable grounds.

Under the Home Office's best use of stop and search scheme Hertfordshire Constabulary will, where practicable, publicise Section 60s to the public.

Dacorum Safer Neighbourhood Inspector Jeff Scott said: "These measures are response to intelligence to suggest a number of people are carrying knives in certain parts of the town. We have reason to believe those involved in this activity are known to one another.

"There are serious consequences if you choose to carry a knife. Not only will you face a possible custodial sentence and criminal record, which could affect your job prospects in later life, you could cause yourself or another person serious injury or even death.

"While some people feel pressured to carry a knife, perhaps as protection or because their friends say it will earn them respect or make others fear them, the truth is that it simply puts you in more danger."
