Officers investigating a dog attack in Croxley Green are appealing for information and witnesses.

It happened on Watford Road at 7am on Friday, May 10.

The victim, a man in his 30s, was working in the street when a man and a woman walked past with two Beagle-type dogs on leads.

One of the dogs jumped up and bit the victim on his arm, leaving him with puncture wounds. The man and woman then left the scene with both of the dogs.

The man is described as tall, with short dark cropped hair. He was wearing a dark-coloured suit. The woman is described as white and of medium build with long blonde hair. She was wearing a mint green-coloured sweatshirt.

The victim later went to hospital for treatment and was administered antibiotics.
