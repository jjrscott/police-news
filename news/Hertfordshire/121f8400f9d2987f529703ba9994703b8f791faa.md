Police are appealing for the public's help to trace a man who is wanted.

Sonny Woolgrove, aged 26, whose last known address is Lawrance Gardens in Cheshunt, is wanted on recall to prison.

He has links to Ware, Hoddesdon, Cheshunt, Waltham Cross and is also known to frequent North London, Bournemouth and Jaywick in Clacton.

Anyone who sees him is asked to contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101, or report information online.

Alternatively, contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their anonymous online form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.

Wanted: Sonny Woolgrove
