Officers are appealing to trace the owners of a number of recovered items they believe to be stolen.

The items, which include jewellery, were recovered from a vehicle in Wembley.

The vehicle, a Volkswagen Polo, was stolen from an address in Radlett on December 17, 2018 and has now been recovered.

There were also items in the vehicle which were stolen from a property in Harrow on January 18, 2019, which has been returned to its owner.

Detective Constable Ian Waldock, from the Borehamwood Local Crime Unit, said: "A number of these items are very distinctive and we would like to reunite them with their rightful owners.

"We believe they could have been stolen from locations in Hertfordshire, possibly Radlett where the recovered vehicle was stolen from.

"If you think that any of these items may be yours, please call Hertfordshire Constabulary on the non-emergency number, 101."
