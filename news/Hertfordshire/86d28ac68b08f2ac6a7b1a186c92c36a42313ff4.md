Hertfordshire Constabulary has been working with partners today (Friday 9 October) to deal with a protest that took place near Maple Cross. The incident has now concluded and no protesters remain at the scene.

The protesters arrived in the area from 7am this morning, assembling large structures with complex lock-on devices to block entrances to the HS2 site. Specialist officers worked throughout the day to remove them.

The site was cleared of protesters at approximately 3pm and some 20 people were arrested on suspicion of public order and associated offences. They are currently in police custody at a number of police stations at this time.
