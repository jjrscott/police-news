As the temperature looks set to drop tonight, the Constabulary is advising motorists of the potential dangers of freezing ice and snow.

Side roads in particular could still be difficult to negotiate as thawing snow turns to ice. Unsalted pavements may also be dangerous.

Superintendent Richard Liversidge, who is based within the Force's control room, said: "Hertfordshire is in for some very cold weather in the next 24 hours and I would ask that everyone travelling around the county take some common some sense precautions. This includes ensuring you have adequate clothing and footwear for the harsh weather conditions.

"The temperature could drop to -4 degrees which could lead to black ice on roads and pavements. Please take care and allow extra time for your journey. Indeed, if your journey isn't important then consider making it later in the week when forecasters say the weather will improve."
