Police have established that there was no third party involvement in the death of a cyclist who was found on the A505 near Therfield on Bank Holiday Monday (May 7).

The man aged in his 50s was found at around 11.45am and appeared to have come off his bicycle. He was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

His family have been updated and the case has now been passed to the coroner for Hertfordshire.

"The family of the man would like to thank all those who stopped to help their loved one and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank members of the public who came forward following our appeal for information."
