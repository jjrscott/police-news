* Cash and animal medication seized during multi-agency raid in Kings Langley
 * Two suspected pit bull terriers were also seized but have since been returned to their owner after it was established the pets were not the banned dog breed
 * The Investigation is on-going

A large amount of cash and animal medication was seized after a multi-agency warrant was conducted at an address in Kings Langley.

Officers from the Abbots Langley Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT) entered the property on Toms Lane just after midday on Wednesday 27 May, under Section 5 of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991.

They were supported by colleagues from the Three Rivers Scorpion Team, and partner agencies including Three Rivers District Council, The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), the Royal Veterinary College and animal welfare specialists.

Following a search of the property, a large amount of animal medication, cash and paperwork was discovered.

These items were seized and are forming part of an ongoing investigation alongside partner agency enquiries into suspected animal welfare offences.

Two dogs - suspected to be pit bull terriers which are banned in the UK - were also seized.

However after an independent assessment, both dogs were confirmed not to be pit bull types and were returned to their owner. Enquiries are continuing.

Sergeant Amy Stansbury, from the Abbots Langley SNT, said: "We took action after receiving intelligence that suggested dogs which are banned breeds in the UK were being kept at the address, and that there were also concerns around the suspected ill-treatment and breeding of the animals.

"This operation highlights just how important partnership working is to neighbourhood policing and also the why it is so vital that the public continues to share information with us so we can build a picture and take action where appropriate."
