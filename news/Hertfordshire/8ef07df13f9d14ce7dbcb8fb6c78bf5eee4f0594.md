* ### Stevenage man jailed for coercive control of former partner

 * ### Pateman would bite and punch his victim

 * ### He threatened to kill himself, his victim and her father

A Stevenage man has been sentenced to three years and nine months in prison after pleading guilty to four offences, including the coercive control of his former partner.

Daniel Pateman, aged 37, of no fixed abode, appeared before St Albans Crown Court on Tuesday (31 July), for mentally and physically abusing his then-girlfriend, including biting her, punching her and threatening to kill her.

Pateman would threaten to kill himself and his girlfriend and her father, saying he would stab her and burn her house down.

The court heard that he would often turn up at her workplace and be aggressive, accusing her of cheating on him with other men and would control who she could spend time with. He caused £5,000 damage to her house after breaking in, threatened to stab her and her family.

Investigating officer, Detective Constable Ryan Lloyd, from the Domestic Abuse Investigations and Safeguarding Unit (DAISU), said: "Pateman is a persistent domestic abuser who constantly prays on his victim to control every aspect of her life. He didn't admit all the offences until day two of the trial, which just added to his victim's distress. I am glad to see him jailed for a lengthy spell.

"We take every report of domestic abuse extremely seriously, and will always fully support victims throughout the investigative process. We are here to bring offenders to justice."

He was sentenced for:

 * Controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship - three years and nine months imprisonment and a restraining order for five years, not to go to his victim's home in Stevenage, plus a £170 fine
 * Assault by beating - three months' imprisonment, to run concurrently
 * Sending electronic communication with intent to cause distress or anxiety - 12 months' imprisonment, to run concurrently
 * Damaging property - 12 months' imprisonment, to run concurrently

If you have been a victim of domestic abuse, you can report it to police on the non-emergency number 101, or online at www.herts.police.uk/report
