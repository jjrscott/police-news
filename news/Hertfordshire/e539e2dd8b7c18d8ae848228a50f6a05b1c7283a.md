Police in Dacorum are reminding people of the action they can take if they are approached by individuals who are begging in an aggressive manner.

PC Natasha Webbe, from the Dacorum Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "We know that members of the public often want to help those they see begging in the street however, these individuals often have complex issues and addictions that will not be helped by spare change. We instead advise people who would like to help the homeless to donate to recognised charities who can offer structured and long-term help and support.

"We're aware that some people beg in an aggressive manner that can be distressing and intimidating to members of the public. If this happens to you please report it to police as soon as possible so that we can take appropriate action.

"We always work with our partners to support vulnerable people and those in genuine need of help to turn their lives around.

"Police also have the power to issue Criminal Protection Notices and Criminal Behaviour Orders, which are designed to stop the illegal behaviour and direct the person concerned towards help from organisations that can provide support and expert advice. If these notices and orders are not adhered to further action can be taken including the individual being arrested."

Please report any incidents of aggressive begging to Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101 or online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.
