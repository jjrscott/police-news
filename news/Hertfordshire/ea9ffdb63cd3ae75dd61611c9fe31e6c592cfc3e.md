Police are appealing for the public's help to identify two suspects following an attempted robbery in Hemel Hempstead.

At around 7pm on Saturday, March 3 a woman was walking through the 'Magic Roundabout' underpass, towards Riverside, when she was approached by a man and woman who attempted to steal her handbag from her.

A scuffle ensued and the suspects fled empty-handed.

The male suspect is described as being aged in his 20s, white, with green eyes and was wearing a hood.

The female suspect, who was wearing a long coat, is described as having blonde hair with dyed dark roots and several facial and ear piercings. She also had tattoos on her hands and neck. She is described as being white and aged in her 20s but looked older than the man.

Detective Constable Katherine Stevens, from the Dacorum Local Crime Unit, said: "Thankfully no property was taken but the victim fell to the ground during the incident and sustained injuries to her face.
