An 18 year old man has been arrested and charged following a serious assault in Watton-at-Stone earlier this month (December).

Tyler Petrie, whose last known address was in the village, was arrested at Stevenage Police Station on Thursday 24 December. He was charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent and possession of an offensive weapon. He appeared at Hatfield Remand Court on Saturday 26 December and has been remanded in custody until a further court hearing next month.

The charge was brought in connection with a serious assault which occurred on Station Road on the evening of Saturday 5 December.
