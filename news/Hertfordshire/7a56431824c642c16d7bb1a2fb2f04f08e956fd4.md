The victim, a man in his 30s, left his Fuji road bike in the rack outside his office but when he went to go home, he found it had been taken.

PC Darren Arbuthnott, who is investigating, said: "This bike is distinctive in that it has red tape around the white handle bars, so I would like to know if anyone has seen this bike around, or been offered it for sale."
