A man has been jailed in connection with a number of drug and driving offences committed in Hertford.

Abdulaziz Sekkoum, aged 19, from Great Cambridge Way in Enfield, was sentenced to three years and four months in prison at St Albans Crown Court on January 2.

On November 23, 2018, officers on patrol attempted to stop a vehicle being driven by Sekkoum in Campfield Road, as he did not have a full licence. He failed to stop and crashed into a garden fence as he attempted to get away.

He was found to be in possession of a quantity of Class A drugs.

Sekkoum was arrested by officers from Operation Scorpion and subsequently charged with:

 * Driving otherwise in accordance with his licence
 * Possession with intent to supply Class A drugs
 * Driving with no insurance

Sekkoum was also given six points on his driving licence.
