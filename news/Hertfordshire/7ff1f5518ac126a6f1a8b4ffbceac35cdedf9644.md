Detectives investigating two robberies in Three Rivers are releasing images of a man they would like to speak to for help with their enquiries.

Between 4.30am and 4.50am on Saturday, October 6, a taxi driver was assaulted in Owens Way and money was taken from him.

The following day, between 3.30am and 4am, a second taxi driver was assaulted in similar circumstances and had cash, bank cards and a mobile phone stolen.

The incidents are being linked by police at this time and it is believed the suspect may have links to Rickmansworth and Bovingdon. He should not be approached by members of the public.

If you recognise him, please get in touch."
