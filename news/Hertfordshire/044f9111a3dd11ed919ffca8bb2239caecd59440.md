Officers investigating an aggravated burglary at a home in Radlett are re-appealing for information and witnesses one month on from the incident.

At around 1.30am on Sunday, December 24 in Orchard Close, the victim - a man in his 70s - awoke after hearing a noise in his house to find two intruders.

They took his walking stick and hit him with it, leaving him with minor injuries, before they left empty-handed.

The offenders were described as tall and wearing dark clothing with hoods and balaclavas.

Detective Constable Ben Heath, who is investigating, said: "Thankfully the victim was not seriously hurt but understandably it has left him very shaken.

"We are still working hard to identify those responsible for this burglary and we have already explored a number of avenues, but I would urge anyone who may have seen a group of men matching the description loitering in the area or running away from the scene around the time stated to please get in touch if they have not done so already."

If you have any information that may assist the investigation, please contact Hertfordshire Constabulary via the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference J1/17/5432, or report information online at www.herts.police.uk/report.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
