* ### Police release new CCTV following burglary in Buntingford.

 * ### Officers re-appeal for information.

Police have released CCTV footage following a burglary in Buntingford last month.

The offence happened at around 5pm on Friday February 23. A grey BMW has pulled up in front of an address in Olvega Drive before being driven off. Shortly afterwards, three men have broken in to the home taking items from inside.

Detective Constable Dieter Sweeting said: "We have now released the CCTV footage in the hope that someone may recognise these men or the car they were driving in. There is a chance they could have links to the Luton area.

"Anyone with any information is asked to contact the East Herts Local Crime Unit via the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference A5/18/129, or report information online."

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
