Police are appealing for information and witnesses following an incident of arson at a hair salon in Watford.

Between 11pm and 11.20pm on Sunday December 23, two men set alight the door and letterbox at Samaira Salon in Whippendell Road using an unknown accelerant and causing damage.

The offenders did not gain entry and ran off when disturbed by members of the public.

The offenders are described as wearing dark clothing.

Detective Constable Jennifer Stoddart, who is investigating, said: "We believe two members of the public assisted in putting out the fire.

"I am appealing for them and anyone else who might have seen what happened, or may have seen suspicious activity in the area around the time of the fire, to please get in touch with me.

"If you've got information, no matter how small it might seem, call 101 or email me at _jennifer.stoddart@herts.pnn.police.uk_ quoting crime reference 41/68852/18. The information could be vital to our investigation."
