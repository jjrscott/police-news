Detectives investigating a burglary in Croxley Green are appealing for information and witnesses.

Between 2.30pm and 11pm on Saturday, September 8, entry was gained to a property in Repton Way via an unlocked rear door.

Cash was then stolen from a purse and rings were taken from an upstairs dressing table.

Detective Constable Nicola Stewart, from the Rickmansworth Local Crime Unit, said: "We have received reports that men were seen knocking on doors in the area the previous day. I would like to identify these men as they may be able to assist us with our enquiries.

"I would also like to hear from anyone living in the area who may have any CCTV or doorbell cam footage. If you can help, please contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact DC Stewart via email to nicola.stewart@herts.pnn.police.uk or by calling the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/35151/18. You can also report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
