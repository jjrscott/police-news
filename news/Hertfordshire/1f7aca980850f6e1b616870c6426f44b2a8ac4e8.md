A Hertford man has been jailed after pleading guilty to multiple offences.

Michael Cakebread, aged 30, from Oak Tree Close, appeared at Hatfield Magistrates' Court yesterday (Monday, April 8), having been charged with:

• Two counts of theft from a shop
• Taking a motor vehicle without the owner's consent
• Two counts of breaching a Criminal Behaviour Order
• A public order offence
• Failing to stop (a vehicle) for police
• Driving with no insurance
• Driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence

He was sentenced to a total of 26 weeks in prison and ordered to pay costs and compensation.

Detective Sergeant Dave Boden, from the East Herts Local Crime Unit, said: "Michael Cakebread is a prolific offender and I am pleased he is now serving a custodial sentence. We have attempted to work with him on many occasions to turn his life around but, unfortunately, his pattern of offending has continued."
