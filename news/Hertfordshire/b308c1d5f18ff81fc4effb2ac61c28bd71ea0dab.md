* ### Operation Stomp back in action in Bishop's Stortford.

 * ### Local residents visited by teams.

 * ### Local police teams tackle local issues.

Operation Stomp was back in action In Bishop's Stortford on Wednesday September 12.

The police-led, multi-agency operation aimed at protecting communities and keeping local residents safe was implemented in Ascot and Plaw Hatch Close between 1 and 7pm.

Officers from the East Herts Safer Neighbourhood Team were joined by colleagues from East Herts Council, Herts Fire and Rescue Service, Clarion Housing, Natwest, local Councillor Colin Woodward, police volunteers, police cadets and Raynet who provided their communications vehicle.

The teams were on site to give crime prevention advice and hold surgeries with local residents who may have issues and concerns.

During the afternoon officers and police volunteers visited more than 300 addresses locally to talk to residents about any concerns they may have, offer crime prevention advice and sign up over 100 people to OWL - the online watch link that keeps communities in touch with local officers.

'Safe and Well' checks were also carried out in numerous homes to ensure they had smoke alarms and to identify any other vulnerabilities.

During the operation officers dealt with the problem of nuisance parking, an issue that was highlighted by local residents as a priority and which is commonly attributed to the areas around local schools .

Commenting on the event, Bishop's Stortford Safer Neighbourhood Sergeant Mark Collins said: "Operation STOMP is about identifying vulnerability and preventing people becoming victims of crime. It has always been very well received by the local communities and we hope we will continue to see a reduction in crime as a result."

Thank you to all the agencies that took part in keeping East Herts a safe place to live and work.
