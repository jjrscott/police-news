Detectives are releasing a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to as part of their enquiries into a sexual assault that happened in Watford.

Between 2pm and 2.30pm on Monday, January 7, a woman in her 40s was walking along Leavesden Road near the junction with Acme Road with her young son, when she was approached by a man outside the Chrysalis Dental Practice.

The man spoke to her and then inappropriately touched her before he continued walking.

The victim shouted at the man and tried to confront him, after which he ran down Leavesden Road towards St Albans Road.

Detective Constable Jonathan Holmes, from the Watford Local Crime Unit said: "Incidents of this nature are concerning and I am keen to speak to anyone who recognises this man as he may be able to assist with our investigation.

"I am also keen to speak to anyone who may have driven along Leavedsen Road between these times, especially those who may have recordings on dash cameras in their vehicles."

Anyone who recognises the man pictured, or anyone who witnessed the incident, is asked to contact DC Holmes on jonathan.holmes@herts.pnn.police.uk or the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/2065/19. You can also report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.

Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.

For over 30 years, Crimestoppers has always kept its promise of anonymity to everyone who contacts them.
