A partnership that seeks to reduce crime and keep people safe in Welwyn Hatfield has won an award for its approach to tackling anti-social behaviour in Welwyn Garden City.

The Welwyn Hatfield Community Safety Partnership (CSP)* was crowned the winner of the Chief Constable's Problem Solving Award at the Chief Constable's Annual Awards ceremony.

The CSP's positive action has seen a 31 per cent reduction in anti-social behaviour between October 2017 and April 2018 compared with the previous year, and as a result demand on police resources has reduced.

Towards the end of 2017, a rise in reports of anti-social behaviour in the Woodhall area prompted the creation of a multi-faceted problem-solving plan to tackle the issue head on.

At the issue's peak, police were receiving up to 30 calls a day from residents, business owners and visitors who were being affected by the behaviour of a small minority of local young people.

Welwyn Hatfield Safer Neighbourhood Inspector Sophia Adams mobilised her team to work closely with partners including Welwyn Hatfield Borough Council, community housing, community safety organisations and Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service. Youth groups were also included as the plans progressed.

Part of that plan included a Partnership Community Information Day, which aimed to gauge the opinion of the local people. It became apparent that residents felt the shopping parade was unloved and that it was having a knock-on effect, as young people were using it as an area to congregate as there was nothing else for them to do.

Hertfordshire's Police and Crime Commissioner David Lloyd provided £19,000 to help fund outreach workers who oversaw a questionnaire asking the district's young people what provisions they thought were missing, and a plan was formulated.

As a result, work is ongoing to redesign aspects of the parade and improved CCTV cameras have been installed. Fire safety issues have been addressed and improved waste management steps have been implemented. Benches are being redesigned and anti-climb measures put in place to stop youths gaining access to the flats above the shops. The implementation of these changes has had an overwhelmingly positive effect on the area.

Inspector Adams and Welwyn Hatfield Borough Council's Community Partnerships Manager Matt Rayner accepted the award on behalf of the CSP at the Hatfield House awards ceremony on October 16.

Inspector Adams said: "It was a great honour for myself and Matt to accept this award on behalf of everyone who has been involved in this problem-solving strategy.

"When dealing with issues such as anti-social behaviour, partnership working is absolutely vital and I have no doubt that we would not be where we are today without the help and support of all the stakeholders involved.

"Complaints to both the police and the council are at the lowest recorded level since before Christmas 2017, which is something to be celebrated.

"However we will not be complacent, and we are looking forward to building on the partnership's success going forward."

Councillor Bernard Sarson, Executive Member for Community Safety, said: "It is fantastic news that the Community Safety Partnership has been recognised for all the hard work they have done to tackle anti-social behaviour throughout Welwyn Hatfield.

"The partnership has used best practice and collaborative working to meet the challenge of ASB, both in schools as well as on the streets. Work has included Paul Hannaford speaking at every secondary school in the borough to help educate and deter young people from getting involved in ASB, and setting up regular activities for young people to get involved in, including Friday Night Kicks.

"Our work to tackle ASB in the borough continues with our new Positive Pathways project, which focuses on early intervention with young people in both Welwyn garden City and Hatfield, working with their families to signpost them to the right support."
