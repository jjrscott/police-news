A man has been sentenced to five years and seven months in prison after being found with Class A drugs in Welwyn Garden City.

Hakeem Kadri, age 33 of Murphy Street, London, appeared at St Albans Crown Court on Thursday, April 4 for trial and sentencing.

Kadri was stopped by officers from the Operation Scorpion Team* in Hollybush Lane on November 2, 2018. He was found to be in possession of crack cocaine and heroin.

Detective Constable Ben Dransfield, who investigated the case, said: "Hertfordshire Constabulary takes a strong stance against drug dealing and the Operation Scorpion Team work tirelessly to target those suspected of committing drugs offences.

"I hope that this sentence reassures residents that we will do all we can to take drugs off our streets.

"If you suspect that drugs activity is taking place in your local area, please never hesitate to report it to us. You might just have the missing piece of the jigsaw that allows us to catch an offender."

_You can report information about drugs through the non-emergency number 101 or online atwww.herts.police.uk/Report. _

_Alternatively, you can stay 100% anonymous by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or via their untraceable online form atwww.crimestoppers-uk.org._

_*Operation Scorpion officers work in a specialist unit that tackles acquisitive crime - such as burglaries, robberies and drug offences - by relentlessly pursuing criminals and bringing them to justice._
