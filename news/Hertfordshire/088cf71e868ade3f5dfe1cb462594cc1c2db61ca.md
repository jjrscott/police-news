Detectives in North Herts are appealing for the public's help to trace a man they would like to speak to in connection with an assault in a Hitchin bar.

The incident happened in Osinskys on Saturday, February 23, into the early hours of Sunday February 24 and resulted in a man being hit in the face with a glass.

Officers would like to speak to the man pictured as they believe he was in the bar at the time and could have information which will help the investigation.

If you recognise the man pictured please contact Detective Mike Hardiman in the North Herts Local Crime Unit via the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 41/18251/19. You can also report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.
