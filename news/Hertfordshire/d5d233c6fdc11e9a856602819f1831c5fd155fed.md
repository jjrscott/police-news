Police patrols are being increased in response to concerns about suspected drug use in Parkhouse Court, Hatfield.

Officers from the Welwyn Hatfield West Safer Neighbourhood Team are conducting high-visibility patrols both within the blocks of flats and in the parking areas.

PC Richard Tomlinson, from the Welwyn Hatfield West Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "A number of residents have been in touch to voice concerns around suspected drug use in Parkhouse Court and the aim of these patrols is to prevent and detect crime in the area."

Welwyn Hatfield Safer Neighbourhood Team Inspector Wayne Nash added: "Drug use, and the associated criminality that often comes with it, will not be tolerated in Welwyn Hatfield.

"The public are our eyes and ears and the information they hold may be the missing piece of the puzzle that enables us to carry out further action.

"I would like to thank those residents who have got in touch to report their concerns and I would encourage anyone who has information about suspected drug use in the area to get in touch on the non-emergency number 101 so that we can tackle the issue."
