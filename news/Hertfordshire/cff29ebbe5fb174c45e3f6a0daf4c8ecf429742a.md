These are some of the reasons our Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs) applied for the role. As part of a new recruitment campaign we're asking what might prompt you to make that move.

"There are a whole host of reasons why the role of a Police Community Support Officer is attractive," said Superintendent for Workforce Development, Clare Smith. "Many people have had a career elsewhere and want a role which has a direct impact on the community. You may have built up life skills and experiences which could be a great advantage to the role.

 "As a PCSO you're given your own geographical area and it is your job to get to know the community; their issues, concerns and what may be affecting their quality of life, and find solutions to help.

"You'll be supporting victims of crime, instigating crime prevention initiatives, conducting patrols to prevent crime and reassure residents and generally being a port of call in your community. It's a very unique role that our PCSOs say is challenging, but incredibly rewarding."

PCSOs work in Safer Neighbourhood Teams across the county. Safer Neighbourhood Teams work with the community to improve the quality of life for residents and make their area safer, by proactively tackling crime and anti-social behaviour (ASB).

The role of a Police Community Support Officers is paid and there are opportunities for people who wish to work part-time or flexible hours. The role involves evening and weekend shift work, including working some weekends and evenings to 11pm. Anyone who is interested in finding out more about the role can visit.

Police and Crime Commissioner for Hertfordshire, David Lloyd said: "I see strong value in our continued investment in our PCSOs because they have a vital role in intelligence gathering and they get to know the communities in our towns and villages.

"They are a key part of neighbourhood policing in Hertfordshire and I know anyone joining the team will find the role exciting and varied."
