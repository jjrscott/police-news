Police are appealing for the public's help in tracing a missing boy from Stevenage.

_He is described as white, 4 ft tall, of thin build with short, brown curly hair and blue eyes. He was last seen wearing a black jumper, black trousers and black shoes._

Officers are growing increasingly concerned for his welfare.
