Officers are appealing for information and witnesses following three commercial burglaries that all happened on the same night in Baldock.

Police were called to a potential burglary at Ashville Trading Estate on Royston Road just after midnight on Tuesday, December 12.

On arrival they found that three business units all next to each other had been targeted. The offenders are believed to have gained entry by damaging the walls. It appears that police disturbed the offenders as no items were stolen from any of the premises. Despite extensive searches, no offenders were located.

The affected businesses were the Coil Slitting Company (crime reference G4/17/1204), the Carpet Factory (G4/17/1205) and Travel Spot (crime reference G4/17/1206).

Detective Constable Georgie Peggie, who is investigating, said: "I am appealing for anybody who might have seen anything suspicious in the area during this time to get in contact."

Letchworth and Baldock Safer Neighbourhood Team Sergeant Alan Clarke added: "I would like to urge the public to remain vigilant when passing commercial properties and to report anything they deem suspicious. I would rather police attend and confirm everything in order than not be called at all and another business owner becomes a victim."

Anyone with information should contact DC Peggie on the non-emergency number 101, quoting the relevant crime reference number. You can also report information online.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through their Anonymous Online Form. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will never need to go to court.
