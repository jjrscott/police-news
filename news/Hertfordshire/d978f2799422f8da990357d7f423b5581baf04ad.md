* ### Summer drink and drug drive campaign

 * ### Beds, Cambs and Herts Road Policing Officers continue work to make our roads safer

 * ### Drivers warned not to put themselves and others at risk

There will be further focus on targeting drink drivers and those driving under the influence of drugs in the coming weeks by the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit in support of the National Police Chief's Council summer alcohol and drug campaign.

Sgt Ian Manley from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit said: "It simply isn't worth it. Even one drink can impact your reactions and put your own and others' safety at risk. My colleagues and I know all too well the horrendous, extremely serious and sometimes fatal consequences caused by people driving under the influence of drink and drugs."

Between June 2018 and May 2019 for various offences* there were 522 arrests in Bedfordshire, 859 in Cambridgeshire and 846 in Hertfordshire.

Sgt Manley continued: "Sadly there are a very small minority of people who continue to drive under the influence but the key message from us is to have none for the road. A drink-driving conviction can be devastating, with significant criminal, personal, social and employment consequences.

"Obviously our main focus 24/7 is to reduce casualties on our roads and our work targeting all of the key factors which contribute to collisions will continue whilst supporting the campaign."

*Offences relating to the figures above:

 * Attempt to drive a motor vehicle with a proportion of a specified controlled drug above the specified limit
