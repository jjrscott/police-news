Officers from the Welwyn Hatfield Community Safety Unit have successfully secured another closure order under the Anti-Social Behaviour (ASB) Crime and Policing Act 2014.

The property - a flat in Cole Green Lane, Welwyn Garden City - was investigated following reports of suspected drug use and dealing and anti-social behaviour.

St Albans Magistrates' Court granted the closure order yesterday (Thursday 8 August). It means that no-one, except the occupant, can enter the house for three months and anyone who breaches this will be arrested.

The court was satisfied that the necessary criteria for a closure order had been met:

 1. That a person has engaged, or is likely to engage, in disorderly, offensive or criminal behaviour on the premises, or
 2. That the use of the premises has resulted, or is likely to result, in serious nuisance to members of the public, or
 3. That there has been, or is likely to be, disorder near those premises associated with the use of those premises

PC John Phelan, from the Welwyn Hatfield Community Safety Unit, said: "When we receive regular reports of ASB linked to an address we will not hesitate to use a closure order if we believe it will help improve the quality of life for our local communities.

"Drug dealing and ASB will not be tolerated in Welwyn Hatfield and I would urge any residents with concerns to report this to us so we can take appropriate action."
