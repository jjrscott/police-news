* ## Ongoing operation to combat anti-social behaviour is currently running in Letchworth.

 * ## Operation Kinematic was launched in March and numerous young people have already been arrested.

 * ## Officers are now targeting a group of youths who are using the rail stations in Letchworth and Baldock to travel around the area and commit crime.

An operation to combat anti-social behaviour and criminal damage is underway in Letchworth as a result of increased reporting of these types of activity.

Officers launched Operation Kinematic in March this year in response to issues with young people in the town centre. Working with partners, schools and parents, offenders were identified and appeared at court charged with criminal damage, robbery, assault, thefts, and knife related offences.

Neighbourhood Inspector James Lant explained: "Unfortunately we are seeing another increase in anti-social behaviour. The local railway stations in both Baldock and Letchworth are being used by a group of children and their anti-social activity is now taking place in a number of locations in Letchworth.

"I would like to reassure residents and local businesses that we are taking this issue very seriously and have measures in place to tackle the problem. We are also working with partner agencies to seek longer term solutions to ensure that these individuals cease their anti-social behaviour. "

Officers have been conducting high visibility patrols in problems areas and working with British Transport Police to identify offenders using the rail network. Three arrests have been made in relation to knife crime and Section 35 dispersal powers have once again been implemented on two separate occasions. These orders have helped to minimise the impact of the children's behaviour as they allow officers to remove people from an area and make it a crime if this is not complied with.

Officers are also looking at using Criminal Behaviour Orders and Community Protection Notices to prevent further offending as well as linking in with parents and schools.
