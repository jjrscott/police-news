Officers are appealing for the public's help to trace a teenager who is missing from her home in Stevenage.

16 year old Shian Goodman was last seen at home at around 2.30pm today (Friday 7 August).

Shian is described as white, 5ft 2in tall and of a medium build. Her hair is shaved and dark on the sides but the rest is longer and blonde.

She was last seen wearing a multi-coloured vest top and black shorts (just above the knee).

Shian has links to Stevenage, Tewin and Peterborough.

Officers are growing increasingly concerned for her welfare.

If you have seen Shian since she went missing or have information on her whereabouts please call the non-emergency number 101 quoting ISR 471 of 7 August. For immediate sightings, call 999 straight away.
