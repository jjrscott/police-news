* A tudor style dolls house has been stolen following a burglary in Hitchin
 * Anyone who sees a dolls house for sale is asked to contact police via 101

Police are appealing for witnesses and information following a burglary in Broadmead, Hitchin on March 11.

The incident happened at around 8.20pm when three offenders forced their way into the property via the front door. Offenders made an untidy search of the premises and then left the house taking a thatched dolls house with them.

The stolen dolls house is 1ft 5in high and 2ft wide, is a tudor style and has a thatched roof. It had been restored by hand.

Investigating officer DC Sarah Walsingham said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time and saw any suspicious behaviour to please get in contact.

"I'd also be interested to speak to anyone who may have been offered a dolls house similar to the one pictured for sale. It holds a great deal of sentimental value and we are very keen to recover it and get it back to its rightful owners.

 Anyone who has any information about this burglary, or has been offered a dolls house similar to the one described for sale, is asked to contact police via the non-emergency number 101 or on, quoting the crime reference G1/18/823.
