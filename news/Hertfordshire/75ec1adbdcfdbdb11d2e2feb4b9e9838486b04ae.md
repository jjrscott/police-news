Officers investigating an indecent exposure in Cheshunt are appealing for information and witnesses.

It happened on the tow path of the River Lee Navigation at 2am on Friday 26 July.

A man has approached three women on a canal boat and tried to engage them in conversation. The women asked him to leave, which he did, but he then returned a few minutes later and indecently exposed himself. He then left the area. He made no attempt to touch or grab the victims.

The man is described as black, of slim to medium build, between 5ft 9in and 5ft 10in tall and aged in his early twenties.

He had short, black curly afro-style hair and a rough complexion, possibly due to acne scarring.

He was wearing a blue Adidas tracksuit with yellow stripes and spoke with a London accent.

Investigator Kay Leverton said: "This was an understandably distressing incident for the victims and I would like to reassure them that we are doing all we can to identify the person responsible.

"We are conducting a number of enquiries however as part of our investigation I would like to appeal to the public. Have you witnessed anyone matching the description acting suspiciously in the area?

"Do you live nearby and have a doorbell camera or home CCTV system fitted to your property? If so, we would be grateful if you could check your footage in case you have captured anything of note.

"If you have any information you think may be useful to the investigation, please contact us straight away."
