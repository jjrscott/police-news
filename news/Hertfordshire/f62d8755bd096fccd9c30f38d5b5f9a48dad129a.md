* ### Winner of Halloween quiz has been selected

 * ### Five year old Cillian from St Albans announced winner

The lucky young winner of this year's Hertfordshire Constabulary Halloween and Bonfire Night competition has been selected and presented with their prizes.

The competition was open to children from the ages of five through to 16, who were asked to read through some safety and crime prevention advice on the Constabulary's Halloween and Bonfire Night web pages, and then to answer a series of multiple-choice questions. The lucky winner was then chosen at random from the list of entrants.

The winner of this years quiz was Cillian, aged five from St Albans who was the lucky recipient of the family ticket to the Warner Bros. Studio Tour - The Making of Harry Potter in London.

The prize was kindly donated to Hertfordshire Constabulary by Warner Bros.
