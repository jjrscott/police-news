Officers investigating a burglary at a riding school in Furneux Pelham are appealing for information and witnesses.

Between 6.30pm on Wednesday, 9 January and 8am on Thursday, January 10, a riding school in Barleycroft End was broken into.

Tens of thousands of pounds worth of saddles and harnesses were stolen, and cash from a float.

The victim also believes the offender(s) attempted to steal diggers and dumper trucks, and some trucks had windows broken.

PCSO Karen Broad, who is investigating, said: "I'm appealing for anyone who was in the area between the times stated and believes they saw someone acting suspiciously to get in touch.

"Please contact me if you have any information on _karen.broad@herts.pnn.police.uk_ or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting crime reference 41/2883/19."

As well as contacting the investigating officer directly, you can also report information online at www.herts.police.uk/Report.
