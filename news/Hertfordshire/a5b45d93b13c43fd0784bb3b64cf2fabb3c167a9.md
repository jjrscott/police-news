Following an investigation into a fire at a number of properties in Northchurch, police have recorded the cause as accidental and no further action will be taken.

The fire started in Herons Elm just before 1.25pm on Thursday 6 August and affected four properties.

Firefighters from Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service attended and put out the fire before making the area safe.

Police also attended the scene to make initial enquiries, in liaison with their fire service colleagues, as to the cause of the fire.

After speaking to witnesses and all involved parties, police determined that the fire began in a shed in the rear garden of one of the affected properties after a bottle of paint thinners was inadvertently ignited.

PC Michael Durrant, who carried out the investigation, said: "After speaking to all parties involved, we have come to the conclusion that this is nothing more than a terrible accident.

"Words of advice have been given and we have been working in partnership with Dacorum Borough Council to ensure those affected have been given the support they need in relation to tenancy matters and emergency accommodation where required.

"In the days following the fire, it was heartening to see local residents rally round those affected and it was reassuring to see such strong community spirit."
