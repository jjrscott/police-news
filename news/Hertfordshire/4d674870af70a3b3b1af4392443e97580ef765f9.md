* ### Bike Marking event in Hatfield on Friday 26 July.

 * ### All welcome for crime prevention advice.

 * ### Come and meet members of the Safer Neighbourhood Team.

A free bicycle marking event will take place in Hatfield on Friday (26 July).

Officers from Hatfield Town Centre Safer Neighbourhood Team will be outside the Library, in Queensway between 12pm and 2pm, security marking pedal cycles and giving out general crime prevention advice.

Marking bikes in this way makes them less attractive to thieves, as they are harder to sell on. It also means they can be reunited with their rightful owners more easily should they ever get lost or stolen.

PCSO Deborah Rogers, from Hatfield's Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "This is a great opportunity for us to meet with members of the public, add security markings to bikes and pass on crime prevention tips."

Further advice on how to keep your bicycle more secure can be found on the 'crime prevention' section of the Herts police website.
