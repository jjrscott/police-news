"We would like to hear from anyone who saw this MG either at the location or being transported. We would also like to hear from you if you have seen this car for sale anywhere. Any information you may have could help our inquiry."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact 101 quoting crime reference number A1/17/4010 or report information online.
