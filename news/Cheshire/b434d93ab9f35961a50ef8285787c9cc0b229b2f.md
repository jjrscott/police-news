Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an assault in Wilmslow.

At around 2.50am on Sunday 1 March, a man and his friend were involved in an altercation with a group of males outside a supermarket on Alderley Road.

The group then assaulted the man before fleeing the scene. The 21-year-old victim was injured as a result of the incident and was taken to hospital for treatment.

Officers are now appealing for anyone who may have witnessed what happened or may have more information to come forward.

Detective Constable Rebecca Smith said: "I would like to reassure the local community that we believe this to be an isolated incident and are doing everything we can to track down those responsible and bring them to justice.

"We have been following a number of enquiries and I am keen to speak to anyone who may have been in the area at around 2.50am to 3am and may have witnessed the incident.

"Alternatively we want to hear from anyone who may have captured any dashcam footage of the offenders leaving the scene.

"If you have any information at all please get in touch with us via 101 or through Crimestoppers anonymously."

Anyone with information is urged to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101 quoting IML 650052 or via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report/

Information can also be passed on to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or report it online via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
