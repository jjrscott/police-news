Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an attempted robbery of a car on the A49 near Spurstow.

At around 4pm on Thursday 9 July, a report was received that a Silver BMW overtook and stopped in front of a Mercedes near to Badcock's Lane.

Two males left the BMW and demanded the keys to the Mercedes.

The driver refused to hand over the keys and the offenders then kicked the wing mirror before returning to the BMW and driving towards Tarporley on the A49.

The vehicle was later spotted in Staffordshire where it was pursued by specially trained Roads Policing officers before it collided with a bus stop on A34 in Safford.

Four men were initially arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, attempted theft of a vehicle and criminal damage to a vehicle however one male was de-arrested and taken to hospital for treatment as a result of injuries sustained during the collision.

The three males have since been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Officers are now appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the incident on the A49 or have dashcam footage to get in touch.

Detective Constable Victoria Greenhoff said: "We have been following a number of enquiries in relation to this incident and are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed the incident or had seen the silver BMW to come forward.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who may have caught dashcam footage of the incident itself, or anyone who may have footage of the vehicle on the lead up to the incident and after as it may be able to assist with our investigation.

"Following the incident it is believed that the car travelled to other areas in Cheshire, including Chester and Warrington, and we are appealing for motorists in those areas who believe they may have seen the car to get in touch."
