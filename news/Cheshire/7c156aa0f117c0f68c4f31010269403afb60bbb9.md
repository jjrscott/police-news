A man who repeatedly kicked and punched a homeless man as he lay helpless on the floor has been jailed.

John Hall appeared at Crewe Magistrates Court on Monday 4 January 2021 where he was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison.

The 50-year-old previously of Medow Mill Court, Congleton, and now of John Street, Macclesfield, had earlier pleaded guilty to assault by beating.

The attack took place as the victim, a 39-year-old man, was seeking shelter in Bridestone Shopping Centre, Congleton, at around 8.30pm on Saturday 16 May 2020.

During the court hearing the judges were shown CCTV footage which clearly showed Hall repeatedly kicking and punching the victim as he lay on the floor.

Due to the severity of the assault, and the fact that it was a blatant and deliberate attack, the court were left with no option but to hand Hall a prison sentence.

Following the sentencing, Police Constable Iain Bell, who led the investigation, said: "Hall's actions were simply despicable and I welcome the sentence that has been handed to him.

"This was a totally unprovoked attack and at no point did the victim retaliate in anyway.

"Thankfully, despite Hall's actions, the victim was able to escape the attack with just minor injuries, although the outcome could have been far worse."

Cheshire Police and Crime Commissioner David Keane said: "I would like to thank all of the officers involved in this investigation for their work.

"Incidents of this nature are particularly distressing and I hope that this sentencing will provide some closure for the victim and reassurance for the local community."
