A 32-year-old man from Ellesmere Port has been sentenced to two years in prison following an investigation into indecent images.

John King, formerly of King Street, Ellesmere Port appeared at Chester Crown Court on 9 October to be sentenced after pleading guilty to possession, making and distribution and taking of indecent images. He was also given a 10 year Sexual Harm Prevention Order.

Detectives from Cheshire Constabulary's Online Child Abuse Investigation Team carried out a warrant on 10 December 2019 after it received information that an account associated to King had downloaded indecent images.

Once detectives began to examine the contents of his computers and phone they discovered hundreds of indecent images. King was subsequently charged.

DC Leanne Brundrett said: "People like King need to realise that what they are doing is putting children in danger and harming them both physically and mentally.

"Our team is dedicated to protecting vulnerable children. By working with the Child Exploitation and Online Protection agency we are tirelessly tracking down those who pose a risk to young people with their abhorrent exploitation and we will continue to put people like King before courts to ensure their victims are getting justice. People need understand that their behaviour is not going unnoticed and you could find us knocking at your door."
