**Four women who were arrested by Cheshire police in connection with a series of offences across the North West have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud.**

Emmiline Burdon, 29, Lyndsey Burdon, 36, Sarah Burdon, 40, and Sonia Malhi, 37, were all arrested on Wednesday 13 May as part of an investigation co-ordinated by detectives from Macclesfield and Northwich Beat teams and well as officers from Merseyside's fraud unit.

The detectives were supported by Cheshire Constabulary's Economic Crime Unit.

All four women were subsequently charged with conspiracy to commit fraud along with a number of other offences.

Emmiline Burdon, of Riverdale Road, Manchester; Lyndsey Burdon, of Brynorme Road, Manchester; Sarah Burdon, of Evesham Road, Manchester; and Malhi, of Hobson Crescent, Audenshaw, Greater Manchester; all appeared at Chester Crown Court on Thursday 25 June where they pleaded guilty to the all offences.

They have all been remanded in custody and are due to be sentenced week beginning 20 July

The charges relate to allegations of the fraudulent usage of stolen bank details that were allegedly used to purchase items at stores in Cheshire, Merseyside, Lancashire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester and Derbyshire.
