Mingins has also been charged with assault by beating and causing criminal damage to a property under Â£5,000 in connection with an incident in Lime Tree Avenue in Crewe on Tuesday 14 April.

The two incidents he has been charged in connection with have also led to him being charged with two counts of breaching a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) and one count of breaching bail conditions.
