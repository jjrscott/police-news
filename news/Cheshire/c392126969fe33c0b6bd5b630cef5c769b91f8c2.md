Detectives have released CCTV images of two males they want to speak to in connection with a robbery at a park in Widnes.

The incident occurred at the park behind The Observatory pub in Queensbury Way shortly after 2.20pm on Saturday 7 March.

The victim, a 13-year-old boy from Widnes, was playing football with friends when two males wearing balaclavas walked up to his bicycle.

He questioned the offenders.

At that point one of them showed him a knife and then got on his mountain bike.

The offenders then fled with the bike, in the direction of Queensbury Way and Prescot Road.

The bicycle that they stole was a black and grey Giant mountain bike with green handles and handlebars.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone who believes they may know the identity of the males in the CCTV images to get in touch.

Detective Inspector Ian Whiley, of Widnes Local Policing Unit, said: "The victim was subjected to a frightening and deeply upsetting ordeal.

"I would like to reassure members of the community that we are determined to establish the identities of the offenders, make them face the consequences of their actions and have the stolen mountain bike returned to its rightful owner.

"Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing.

"As part of our enquiries we are looking to trace the males in the CCTV images.

"If you think you recognise them from their builds and the clothes they had on please contact the team here at Widnes Police Station.

"I would also like to appeal directly to the males in the CCTV images to get in touch.

"We also want to speak to anyone who believes they may have seen the stolen mountain bike since the robbery took place, or have information regarding its current whereabouts."

Anyone with any information which may aid the investigation, no matter how small, is urged to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 655108, or give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report.

Alternatively, information can be reported to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously.
