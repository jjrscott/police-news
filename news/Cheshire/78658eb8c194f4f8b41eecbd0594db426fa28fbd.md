Police are appealing for witnesses following a two vehicle collision on the A500 in Barthomley.

At about 6.30pm on Friday 12 February a grey Renault Master van was in collision with a white Fiat Punto.

The driver of the Punto, a 53-year-old woman from Crewe, was taken to Royal Stoke hospital where she remains in a serious but stable condition.

PC Geraint Williams said: "I'd urge anyone who has any information on the collision to contact us. We are especially interested in any dash cam footage that motorists may have available of the collision and - or - the events leading up to it."

Anyone with information should contact PC Geraint Williams in the Serious and Complex Collision Investigation Unit by calling 101 or going to www.cheshire.police.uk and quoting IML 916373.

Information can also be passed anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
