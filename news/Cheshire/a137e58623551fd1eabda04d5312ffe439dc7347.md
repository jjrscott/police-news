**Detectives investigating a burglary at a school in Runcorn are appealing for witnesses to come forward.**

Between 10.45pm and 11.15pm on Thursday 21 November burglars broke into Brookvale Primary School on Northwich Road and stole a quantity of cash.

Some of the money had been collected for Children in Need.

PC Stuart Beswick, of Runcorn Local Policing Unit, said: "Those responsible went to great lengths to break into the school before stealing money whilst inside the building.

"We are following a number of lines of enquiry and are keen to hear from anyone who either has CCTV footage or information which could help with the investigation.

"If you think you can help please call Cheshire Police on 101, quoting IML 570932, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
