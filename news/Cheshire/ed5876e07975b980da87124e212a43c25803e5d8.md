Shortly after 6pm on Wednesday 6 November, police received reports of a serious assault in the kitchen area at the Little India restaurant on Main Street in Frodsham.

A 55-year-old man sustained a serious injury to his neck and has been taken to hospital for treatment.

Another man, aged 62, and a 43-year-old woman were also assaulted during the incident.

Officers are working to establish the full circumstances, and are making enquiries to trace the suspect.

Detective Sergeant Stu Needham said: "We have established that a man left the restaurant and turned right on to Main Street shortly after the incident. He was wearing what appeared to be a maroon hoodie and he had a rucksack.

"As such I'd ask any motorists driving down the street at that time to check their dashcams, as they may hold vital information that will help us.

"We've spoken to several witnesses present already, but I'd appeal to anyone else who was in the restaurant or outside in the Main Street area at the time, who might have witnessed the incident or have any relevant information, to get in touch."

Anyone with information is urged to contact police on 101, quoting IML 558691. Information can also be passed anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
