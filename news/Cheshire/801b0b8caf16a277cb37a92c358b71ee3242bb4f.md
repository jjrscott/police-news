Police in east Cheshire are warning dog owners to be vigilant following a number of suspicious incidents.

Over recent months there have been incidents in Brereton, Scholar Green and Leighton which have caused owners to be concerned that someone is attempting to steal their dogs.

Inspector Kelly Johnston said: "We're also seeing some incidents on social media that haven't been reported to police and would really urge anyone who sees suspicious activity to ring us. We need these incidents reporting to us so we can investigate them.

"We would also urge you to be vigilant and keep an eye out for fellow dog walkers - if you see it, report it.

"We understand your concerns and would like to reassure you that we are taking this seriously and we are investigating the suspicious incidents reported to us."

Anyone with information should contact Cheshire Police on 101 or via www.cheshire.police.uk.
