**Officers are appealing for information from members of the public after a man had his bicycle stolen in a robbery in Runcorn Old Town.**

The victim, an 18-year-old from Runcorn, was riding his lime green VooDoo mountain bike ( _ **pictured above**_ ) along Peel Street when the incident occurred at around 7.10pm on Friday 15 January.

An unknown man kicked the bike when it came into range and knocked the victim off it.

The offender then got on the bike and rode off on it along Waterloo Road, in the direction of Mersey Road.

He was white and looked to be around 19 years old and approximately 5' 11" tall.

The offender appeared to have long, scruffy hair and a muscular/athletic build.

He was wearing black Nike Air Max 110 trainers, black combat pants and a dark grey coat.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and officers are urging anyone with any information or footage regarding the robbery, the offender or the whereabouts of the stolen mountain bike to get in touch.

Police Constable Whitfield, of Runcorn Local Policing Unit, said: "Thankfully the victim did not sustain any significant injuries as a result of this incident, but he has understandably been left shaken up by it.

"I would like to reassure members of the community that we are determined to establish who committed the robbery, make him face the consequences of his actions and have the stolen mountain bike returned to its rightful owner.

"Enquiries are ongoing and I urge anyone who was in the area and saw anything that may aid our investigation to contact us at Runcorn Police Station.

"The same goes for anyone who thinks they may know who the offender is, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of him.

"We also want to speak to anyone who believes they may have seen the stolen mountain bike since the robbery took place, or have information regarding its whereabouts."

Anyone with information or footage that may help the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 895584, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
