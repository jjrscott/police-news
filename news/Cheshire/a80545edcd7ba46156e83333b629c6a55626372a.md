Police are asking the public to help them trace a man from Widnes who is wanted on recall to prison.

Connor Standish is believed to be in Widnes but he also has links to Runcorn, St Helens and Wrexham.

The 24-year-old is white and around 6' tall with a proportionate build. He has dark blond hair and blue eyes.

Anyone who sees Standish is advised not to approach him but to instead call Cheshire Constabulary as soon as possible on 101, quoting IML 736924.

Alternatively, information regarding Standish's whereabouts can be reported anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
