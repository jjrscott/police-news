Police are appealing for witnesses following a collision in Ashton near Chester.

At around 4.24pm on December 31 2020 there was a collision involving two cars at the junction of Ashton Lane and Chester Road, Ashton.

One of the cars is thought to have swerved to avoid a white vehicle coming out of Ashton Lane onto Chester Road.

PC Nick Anderton said: "I'm particularly keen to hear from anyone who was driving in the area in the run up to and following the collision. Did you see the collision, or have you captured it on your dashcam?

"Were you the driver of the white vehicle? If you were I would urge you to contact us so that we can establish the circumstances of the collision."

Anyone with information should contact PC Nick Anderton on 101 or via www.cheshire.police.uk quoting IML 885738.
