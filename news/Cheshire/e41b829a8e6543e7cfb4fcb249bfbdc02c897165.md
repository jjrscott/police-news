Detectives have seized a large quantity of class A drugs and cash in Crewe.

At around 6.00pm on Thursday 16 April two teenagers were stopped by officers inside a supermarket on Vernon Way.

Following a search approximately 400 bags of heroin and crack cocaine was recovered along with almost Â£4,000 of cash.

A 17-year-old and an 18-year-old from Liverpool were subsequently arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs and possession of criminal property.

The men are currently in police custody being questioned by detectives.
