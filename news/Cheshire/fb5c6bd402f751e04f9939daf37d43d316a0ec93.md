Detectives are urging the public to come forward with information after shots were fired at a house in Warrington.

At around 10.20pm on Friday 20 March a vehicle was heard in the location of Reapers Close in Great Sankey - before shots were fired at the kitchen window of a house causing damage to the inside wall.

Three people were inside the house at the time the weapon was discharged, however no injuries were sustained.

A scene is in place and an investigation has begun to establish the exact circumstances.

Officers are patrolling the area to speak to residents and to provide reassurance.

Detective Inspector Jo'anne Flanagan said: "I know an incident like this will concern the local community and I would like to reassure them that officers will be visible and patrolling the area.

"Although a number of people were inside the house at the time, thankfully no one suffered any injuries.

"We are in the early stages of the investigation and conducting a number of house-to-house and CCTV enquiries.

"A number of people were in the area at the time who may have seen or heard something, have dashcam or CCTV footage and I want to encourage them to come forward.

"We are asking the public if they saw anyone acting suspiciously on Reaper Close at around 10.20pm. Or if they saw anything suspicious in this area shortly before or after the firearm was discharged.

"If you did, I really would urge you to get in touch to help with the investigation.

"If you do not want to speak directly to the police you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
