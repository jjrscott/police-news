**Detectives are appealing for information from members of the public following a burglary incident in Alsager.**

At around 6am on Tuesday 10 November a young man broke into a house on Station Road.

He demanded money from the occupants and assaulted one of them, an elderly man, before fleeing the address empty-handed.

The offender, who fled on foot in an unknown direction, is described as approximately 20 years old and around 5' 8" tall.

He had a slim build and was wearing a face mask when he entered the house but not when he left it.

The offender was also wearing a dark parka-type with the furry hood up.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone who was in the area and saw anything that may help their investigation to get in touch.

They also want to speak to anyone who believes that they may know who the offender is, or have dashcam or CCTV footage of him.

Detective Inspector Claire Jesson said: "Thankfully, the elderly man who was assaulted only sustained minor injuries and did not need to go to hospital.

"However, this was a terrifying incident that has understandably left those who were in the house extremely shaken up.

"I would like to reassure residents that this is believed to be an isolated incident and we are doing everything we can to establish the identity of the offender and bring him to justice.

"Enquiries are ongoing and we are hoping that members of the public will aid our investigation by coming forward with relevant information or footage concerning the burglary incident.

"Perhaps you were in the area and saw the offender, either before he entered the house or as he was fleeing the scene.

"Or maybe you have CCTV or dashcam footage of him, or believe that you may know who he is."

Anyone with information or footage that may help the ongoing investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 848396, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
