**Detectives investigating a burglary in Warrington are appealing for information and footage from members of the public.**

The incident occurred in Wellfield Street south, near to Sankey Way, between 5.30pm and 8.30pm on Thursday 12 March.

A house was broken into via the back door whilst no-one was at home.

A quantity of cash and jewellery was stolen from the house following an untidy search.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone who was in the area and saw anything suspicious to come forward.

They also want to speak to anyone who believes they may know who carried out the burglary, or have dashcam footage of them.

Detective Constable Laura Smith, of Warrington Local Policing Unit, said: "Burglary is a serious offence in which victims are targeted in their own home, which is the place they should be able to feel most safe.

"We are determined to establish who carried out the burglary in Wellfield Street and bring them to justice.

"Enquiries are ongoing and we want to speak to anyone who was in the area and believes they may have seen something that could be relevant to our investigation.

"Perhaps you saw whoever committed the burglary before they broke into the house, or as they were fleeing the scene.

"We also want to hear from any motorists with dashcams who were driving in the area and believes they may have footage of the offender, or offenders."

Anyone with any information or footage that may help the ongoing investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 659264, or give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report.

Alternatively, information can be reported to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously.
