A man who terrorised a Crewe family has been jailed for two years and three months and ordered to stay away from them.

Bobby Palin, 32, from Samuel Street in Crewe appeared at Chester Crown Court on 1 May to be sentenced after pleading guilty to stalking and harassment. He was also given a restraining order to further protect the victims.

Between 9 November and 12 December Palin continually called and texted the victims causing them significant fear and distress. He made numerous threats towards them which had a considerable impact on their wellbeing.

DI Claire Jesson said: "The behaviour displayed by Palin is disturbing and had a significant impact on the victims in this case - I commend the victims for being brave enough to stand up to him and come to us for help.

 "Palin thought he was above the law, but this conviction shows that no matter how scared you are, with our help and support we can make the nightmare end.

"I would urge anyone who is in this position to please have the faith in us that this victim has, and contact us. We will do everything to support you and work tirelessly to bring prosecutions against those who cause fear in our community."
