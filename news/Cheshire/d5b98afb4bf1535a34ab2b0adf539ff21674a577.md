Detectives investigating a shooting in Warrington have renewed their appeal for information from the public.

Shortly after 9am on Saturday 11 January a black Audi stopped on Monks Place in Fairfield and Howley.

One man, wearing a yellow high visibility jacket, got out of the car and was seen firing a number of shots towards another man.

The driver of the car remained in the vehicle.

The gunman then got back into the Audi and the pair drove off.

The vehicle was found abandoned a short distance away on Back Forshaw Street and set on fire.

There were no injuries as a result of the incident and enquires are ongoing.

Detective Chief Inspector Mike Evans, from Cheshire Constabulary's Serious and Organised Crime Unit, said: "This investigation is very much ongoing and we're currently following a number of lines of enquiry.

"I'd like to reassure the local community that, from our initial investigation, we are confident this was a targeted attack and there is no risk to the wider public.

"As part of our enquiries we're keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident or anyone with any information which may assist with our investigation.

"We'd specifically like to hear from anyone with any CCTV or dashcam footage of the Audi parked in the Ryland's Drive area prior to the incident.

"I'd urge anyone with any information, no matter how small, to contact us on 101. If you don't want to speak to the police directly you can also call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111."

Chief Inspector Simon Meegan, who is in charge of policing in Warrington, added: "I understand that an incident like this will cause concern within the local community and I would like to reassure those living locally that we are doing all that we can to establish exactly what has taken place and who is responsible.

"Officers will be out and about on patrol in the local area over the coming days and I would encourage anyone with any concerns to speak to them."

Anyone with any information in relation to the incident is asked to call Cheshire Police on 101, quoting IML 609602 or give us the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about .
