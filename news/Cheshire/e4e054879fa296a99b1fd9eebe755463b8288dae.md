Officers from Chester Local Policing Unit have recovered more than £30,000 along with a quantity of Class B drugs following a warrant in Blacon.

At around 5pm on Friday 12 February officers from Chester CID, supported by Special Constables and officers from the Policing Alliance attended an address on Adelaide Road to conduct a drugs raid.

As officers approached the address four men were seen fleeing the scene, as they did so the men disposed of a holdall which was found to contain a quantity of cash and class B drugs (Cannabis).

Further cash and cannabis were also located inside the property.

Three of the men who fled the scene were subsequently arrested nearby on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class B drugs.

The men, aged 24, 25 and 34, have been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Detective Inspector Nick Henderson said: "This is a fantastic result, not only have we seized more than £30,000 but we've also seized a large quantity of Class B drugs which were undoubtedly destined for the streets of Chester.

"The corrosive effect that illegal drugs have on our communities is well known and we are committed to tackling the problem and targeting those involved.

"As part of our ongoing fight, information from the public is vital and I would urge anyone with any information in relation to illegal drug use in their community to get in touch on 101 or visit https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report ."

David Keane, police and crime commissioner for Cheshire, said: "Illegal drugs have a hugely detrimental impact on our communities and it's great to see some of the proactive work taking place to ensure that those responsible are held accountable.

"I would like to thank all the officers involved in this warrant for their hard work helping to remove a quantity of drugs from the streets of Chester."

Information can also be reported anonymously, via Crimestoppers, on 0800 555 111.
