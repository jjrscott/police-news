Police are appealing for dashcam and CCTV footage following the robbery of a delivery van in Runcorn.

Sometime around 7.40am on Saturday 21 November a man was sitting in a plain white van parked up in Keckwick Lane, Daresbury when he was approached by two men. The men got into the van and threatened the driver. He was then driven to Merseyside and was left near the M57 East Lancashire roundabout in distress. The men then made off in his van with its contents.

The first suspect is described as white, 30-40 years old, 6ft 2 to 3 ins tall and of slim build. He was wearing a black or dark green top with his hood up and a hat. He was wearing a dark grey Berghaus type jacket and bottoms.

The second suspect is described as white, 6ft to 5ft 11ins tall and of large build. He was approximately in his early 30s. He was wearing a black hat and black hoodie with the hood up, and a black waterproof jacket.

DC Amanda Antrobus said: "The victim was left shocked and injured following his ordeal and was taken to hospital to be assessed. Thankfully it's not thought that his injuries are serious.

"The area of Keckwick Lane is quite busy, even at that time in the morning with dog walkers and joggers, so I'm particularly keen to hear from anyone who was in the area and saw suspicious activity, or two men getting into a white van.

"If you have CCTV or dashcam footage that may help us please contact us. This was a shocking incident and we want to find those responsible, so if you know anything that will assist our investigation we would urge you to do so."

Anyone with information should contact Cheshire Police on 101 or via www.cheshire.police.uk quoting IML 856410. If you have CCTV or dashcam footage you can send it via the website.

Information can also be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
