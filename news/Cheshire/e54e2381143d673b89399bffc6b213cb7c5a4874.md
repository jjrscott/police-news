Police are appealing for witnesses after an 11-year-old boy was robbed at knife point in Runcorn.

At around 10.50am this morning (1 November 2019) the boy was cycling with his brother when they approached the tunnel under the busway near the Palacefield shops. A teenage boy demanded the bike from the 11-year-old and threatened him with a knife.

The suspect then fled with the bike.

The suspect is described as white, approximately 6ft tall and around 15 or 16. He had a spotty complexion and brown hair which is short at the sides and longer on top.

He was wearing a grey bubble jacket zipped up and black tracksuit pants. He had a strong Liverpool accent.

DC Dan Williams said: "The boy wasn't hurt but he was shaken by his ordeal and I'd urge anyone who saw the incident or has any information that may help me with my enquiries to contact me."

Anyone with information should contact DC Dan Williams on 101 quoting IML 554051.

Alternatively information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 0555 111.
