Police are warning motorists to avoid Northwich Town Centre after flooding has forced a number of roads to be closed.

Many routes in and out are currently closed and more are likely to follow as emergency services and other agencies assess the situation. Evacuations are likely, with one care home currently already evacuated to keep the residents safe.

Superintendent Simon Parsonage said: "We strongly advise that you avoid the area. We can't stress enough the importance of staying away. Those trying to access the town centre are finding themselves stuck in the one way system and unable to turn round. So please avoid the area.

"This is a fast moving incident and emergency services and other agencies including Chester West and Chester and the Environment Agency are working hard to keep people safe. Please follow the advice given by all agencies and avoid travelling."

Roads currently closed include London Road, The Bullring, Chester Way, Hayhurst Bridge and Town Bridge.

Residents are also reminded not to drive or walk through any flood water - this is often deeper than it looks, it may be moving fast and there could be hidden hazards underneath such as raised manhole covers, which can pose a danger.

Anyone concerned about potential flooding should sign up for free flood warnings on the Environment Agency's website, follow them on Twitter @EnvAgencyNW for the latest information or you can call the Flood Line on 0345 988 1188.
