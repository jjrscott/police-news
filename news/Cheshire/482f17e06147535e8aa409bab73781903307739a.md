Detectives are appealing for information after a man was found in Crewe with serious injuries.

Shortly before 2am on Saturday 2 November the 44-year-old local man was found collapsed by a passer-by on Chester Street.

He was taken to Royal Stoke Hospital by ambulance where he is currently described as being in a critical condition having suffered injuries to his head.

Officers are urging witnesses who may have been in the area of the social club car park, including the steps leading down to the Phoenix Leisure Park, between 1am and 2am on Saturday 2 November to come forward.

Detective Inspector Nick Henderson said: "We have been working hard to establish how this man came to sustain such serious injuries and have been following a number of lines of enquiry.

"As part of our investigation I am appealing directly to the public to come forward with information. Perhaps you were near the social club or the Phoenix Leisure Park in the early hours of the morning and may have information?

"If you were driving around this area at this time and have dashcam footage then I would also like to hear from you."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 555159.

Information can also be provided anonymously through the Crimestoppers website https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
