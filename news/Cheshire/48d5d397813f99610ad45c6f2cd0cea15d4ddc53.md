Police are appealing for dash cam footage following a suspicious incident in Knutsford.

Betweem 11pm and midnight on 11 February a woman was driving along the A537 Chelford Road, Knutsford. When she got near its junction with Manor Lane and the Dun Cow pub she stopped to assist a driver whose car appeared to have broken down at the side of the road.

The victim agreed to use her phone to call for a recovery service for the man when he tried to open her door, which was locked. The man then showed what looked like the handle of a knife in the waistband of his trousers. The victim drove off unharmed but alarmed by the incident.

The offender was in a silver Ford Fiesta with the hazard warning lights on at the time and is described as white, 24 to 25-years-old and of slim build. He had brown hair which was short on the back and sides. He was wearing a plain white t-shirt and light grey jogging bottoms. He spoke with an English accent.

DC Jo Jarvis said: "We can't be sure what his intentions were and we are keen to trace the suspect or hear from anyone who had a similar encounter but has not reported it to police. If you were in the area that evening and saw a silver hatchback with its hazards on at the side of the road or have dash cam footage of the car - please also get in touch.

"I'd like to take this opportunity to remind people that if it is late at night and you do see a broken down vehicle and you are on your own, for you own safety it is always advisable that you don't stop to help. If you are genuinely concerned for the welfare of the person in the car, you could phone police on 101."

Anyone with information should contact Macclesfield Police on 101 or via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/ quoting IML 635092. Alternatively information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
