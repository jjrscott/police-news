The son and daughter of vulnerable man who was beaten to death in Warrington town centre have paid tribute to him.

53-year-old Michael Mairs died on Monday 28 October having been attacked by Daniel Sharples on Sunday 6 October 2019.

Sharples, 38, was today, Wednesday 14 October, found guilty of murdering Michael after a seven day trial at Liverpool Crown Court.

Following today's verdict, Michael's son and daughter said: "What Sharples did on the afternoon of 6 October 2019 will live with us forever; that day, Sharples set out to kill and our dad was unfortunately caught in the crossfire.

"It goes without saying that Sharples' actions were those of a vile bully. We will never forget the funny, bubbly, caring man our dad once was.

"We, as a family, would like to thank all the witnesses who came forward and those who tried to help our dad that day. We are more than grateful."
