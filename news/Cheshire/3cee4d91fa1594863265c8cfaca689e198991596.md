Wilmslow police have released a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to in relation to a number of deliberate fires.

For the past few months someone has deliberately set fire to a number of wheelie bins in Dean Road.

PCSO Kerry Hancock said: "We are looking into the incidents and would appeal to anyone who recognises the man, or the dog, in the CCTV to contact us.

"I'd also urge anyone who sees suspicious activity to report it to police. We are investigating the incidents and would urge anyone with information on the incidents to contact us or Crimestoppers anonymously.

"Meanwhile make it difficult for those who set deliberate fires. If possible place out on the morning of collection and return to your property as soon as possible after collection. There are also some helpful tips on prevention on the Cheshire Fire and Rescue website https://www.cheshirefire.gov.uk/public-safety/home-safety/wheelie-bin-fire-safety ."

Anyone with information should contact Cheshire Police on 101 or via www.cheshire.police.uk quoting IML 812264.

Alternatively information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
