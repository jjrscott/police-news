**Detectives investigating a robbery and an assault involving a teenager in Warrington are appealing for information.**

The incident occurred on East Avenue in Stockton Heath at around 4.45pm on Wednesday 2 December.

The victim, a 15-year-old boy from Widnes, was approached by two males who asked him about the jacket he was wearing.

When he refused to give them the jacket he was pushed to the ground and kicked a number of times until he handed it over. The two males then fled on to London Road.

The boy received minor injuries including bruising and marks to his body.

Enquiries have been ongoing and detectives are asking anyone with information or footage that may help their investigation to come forward.

Detective Constable Cameron Mackay, from Warrington Local Policing Unit, said: "As part of our enquiries we understand two males have assaulted the victim in order to steal his jacket.

"While we continue to investigate the incident I am appealing to anyone who either has any information, or perhaps saw something that may assist with our enquiries or maybe knows the males responsible, to please get in touch."

A 16-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of robbery and has been released on conditional bail.

If you have any information please contact Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 865017 or provide information anonymously by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
