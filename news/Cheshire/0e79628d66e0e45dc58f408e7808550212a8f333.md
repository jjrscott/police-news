**Officers investigating a burglary at a bar in Warrington town centre have released CCTV footage of the offender.**

The Lounge in Springfield Street was broken into at around 11pm on Sunday 5 April.

The offender stole an iPad from the premises.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and officers are urging anyone who believes they may know the identity of the offender in the CCTV footage to get in touch.

Police Constable Sarah McNickle, of Warrington Local Policing Unit, said: "We are determined to establish who carried out the burglary, make them face the consequences of their actions and have the stolen iPad returned to its owner.

"Enquiries are ongoing and we are appealing for anyone who believes they may know who the offender is from the CTTV footage to get in touch.

"They are wearing a face covering but we are hoping that someone may recognise them from their build, the way they walk and the clothes they were wearing.

"We are also appealing for anyone who believes they may have seen, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of, the offender that night.

"Perhaps you were out of your home for one of the reasons that we are able to go out during the coronavirus pandemic and saw the offender, either before they broke into the bar or as they were fleeing the scene."

Anyone with information or footage that may aid the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 675856, or give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report.

Alternatively, information can be reported to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
