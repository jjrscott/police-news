**Officers investigating a serious collision in Culcheth have renewed their appeal for witnesses and dashcam footage.**

At around 4.40pm on Thursday 21 November a 16-year-old girl was involved in a collision with a grey Peugeot 308 as she was crossing Common Lane, at the junction with Hob Hey Lane.

The girl, who is from the local area, sustained serious injuries and was taken to Salford Royal Hospital; she is currently in a serious condition.

The driver of the car, a 57-year-old woman from Greater Manchester was uninjured.

Enquiries in relation to the collision are ongoing and as part of the investigation officers are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident or anyone with any information that may aid the investigation.

PC Jim Rodger, from Cheshire Police Serious and Complex Collision Investigation Unit, said: "Common Lane is a busy road through the centre of Culcheth with plenty of people about. As part of the investigation I want to hear from anyone who believes they may have witnessed the collision.

"I'm particularly keen to hear from a man who was seen walking along Hob Hey Lane towards Common Lane at the time of the incident.

"I would also like to speak to the driver of a white 4x4, possibly a Porsche, which was travelling on Common Lane, towards the centre of Culcheth, behind a double decker bus.

"The same goes for any motorists who were driving in the area around the time of the incident and believes they may have captured the incident on their dashcams."

Anyone with information or dashcam footage that may aid the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 570528, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
