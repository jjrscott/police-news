**Officers investigating an arson incident at a closed down restaurant in Ellesmere Port have released a CCTV image of a man they want to speak to in connection with the incident.**

Firefighters were informed of a fire at the former Agra Fort Indian restaurant shortly after 7.30am on Wednesday 27 May.

They were able to extinguish the blaze before it could spread beyond a ground floor extension at the back of the two-storey building.

The fire caused significant damage to the extension.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and officers want to trace the man in the CCTV image as they believe he may be able to help their investigation.

They are appealing for anyone who recognises him or knows who he is to get in touch.

Sergeant Jonathan Wilson, of Ellesmere Port Local Policing Unit, said: "The blaze, which a fire investigator has confirmed was started deliberately, caused significant damage to a section of the building.

"However, the consequences of the fire could have been far worse.

"Fire spreads quickly and can endanger lives as well as properties.

"We are determined to establish who started the blaze and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"We believe that the man in the CCTV image may be able to assist us in that regard.

"If you think you recognise him or know who he is please contact us at Ellesmere Police Station on 101, quoting IML 714844, give us the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

"I would also like to appeal directly to the man in the CCTV image to get in touch."
