Cheshire Police is reminding people to keep up the good work of staying alert and staying safe this weekend.

The vast majority of people have been sticking to the guidance put in place to protect us all and keep us safe.

As a force we are confident people will continue to act responsibly.

As many of us will now be able to spend more time away from home, undertake more activities and meet up with more people than before, we each need to take responsibility for doing that within the regulations - and also follow the guidance which will help reduce the spread of the virus.

Supt Richard Rees said: "The guidance has been changed to give people more flexibility and there are understandably some questions about this as people get to grips with what it means for them. The best way to inform yourself of the new guidelines announced this week is to go to the government website.

"Our overall aim is to continue to encourage and support our communities to comply with the regulations and keep everyone as safe as possible.

"We will continue to use our 4E approach of engaging, explaining, encouraging and only enforcing as a last resort. I'd like to take the opportunity to remind people we cannot enforce social distancing and are relying on your good nature to remember to keep two metres apart, which on the whole people are remembering to do. It's vital for your own safety and that of others.

"People will also need to be mindful of the difference in the regulations between Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and England and check before you travel."

Police and Crime Commissioner David Keane said: "It has been pleasing to see that the majority of Cheshire residents have been following government advice during the lockdown period to help keep our communities safe.

"However, as more flexibility is given we are now entering a fairly critical phase where a second wave of the virus may occur if we don't continue to be vigilant. It is as important as ever that we continue to closely follow the advice issued by the government so we can continue to halt the spread of the virus and save lives."
