Detectives investigating a burglary at a property in Warrington are appealing for information.

At around 9pm on Thursday 18 June three men forced their way into the house on Georges Crescent while three people were inside.

The men searched the property but fled the scene in a black car empty handed.

One of men is described as being in his early 20s, around 6'2" in height and of a stocky build.

The second and third man are described as being their late 20s or early 30s and of a stocky build.

Officers are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen the offenders or the black car around the time of the incident.

Detective Sergeant Ian Bingley, from Warrington Local Policing Unit, said: "This was a terrifying ordeal for victims who have understandably been left shaken by the incident.

"We have been following a number of enquiries and I am keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the car or seen anyone acting suspiciously.

"If you think you can help our investigation and find these men please contact us."

If you have any information please contact Cheshire Police on 101 by quoting IML 733380 or report it via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report/

Alternatively, information can be passed on to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
