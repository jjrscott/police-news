A burglar who targeted a pensioner in her Northwich home has been jailed for four years and two months.

Jonathon Maddock, of Dean Street, Northwich, let himself into the 74-year-old woman's home at around 4.30pm on Saturday 28 September.

The woman was alerted to Maddock being in her address after hearing someone rooting around her kitchen.

The victim confronted him and felt that Maddock was going to steal from her so called the police.

Maddock, 38, fled the scene and was arrested on Sunday 6 October at his home address.

He was charged with burglary later that day.

Detective Constable Paul Matchett of Northwich LPU said: "I am pleased that the courts have handed Maddock a considerable sentence which will see him behind bars for a significant amount of time.

"Burglary is a serious crime whereby victims are targeted in the very place that they should feel safe, their own home.

"What makes this case particularly deplorable is the fact that Maddock knew his victim and yet burgled her home, leaving her feeling extremely upset.

"I hope that this prison sentence will deter others from committing similar offences and bring some closure to the victim so that she can move forward with her life."

Maddock was sentenced at Chester Crown Court on Tuesday 10 March after being found guilty.
