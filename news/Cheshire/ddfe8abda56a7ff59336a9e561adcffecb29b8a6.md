A 17-year-old boy has admitted carrying a knife in Latchford.

The teenager - who cannot be named for legal reasons - was arrested on Ashfield Gardens at 3pm on Tuesday 11 February.

He was stopped by plain clothed officers as part of a recent operation.

Following a search, the knife was recovered from his right sleeve.

The teenager has now been ordered to pay £85 to the Crown Prosecution Service and a surcharge of £21 to fund victim services after pleading guilty at Warrington Magistrates Court on Wednesday 12 February.

He has also been referred to the youth offending panel.

Detective Inspector Chris Maddocks, of Warrington Local Policing Unit, said: "Due to a number of recent incidents across Warrington we have increased patrols to reassure the public and deter offenders.

"In this case the teenager was stopped by officers because he was acting suspiciously and they recovered the knife.

"These patrols will continue over the coming weeks and should come as a warning to anyone who is considering carrying a weapon in a public place."
