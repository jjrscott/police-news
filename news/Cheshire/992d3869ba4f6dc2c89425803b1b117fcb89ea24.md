Detectives investigating an attempted knifepoint robbery in Crewe are appealing for information and footage from members of the public.

At around 2.40pm on Thursday 19 December a 16-year-old boy and his friend were walking on Harrison Drive, near to Dunwoody Way, when they were approached by two unknown masked men.

The men, who were both armed with knives, then threatened the teenager and demanded that he handed over his mobile phone. One of the men also grabbed hold of one of the teenager's wrist. Both teenagers managed to run away to safety

The first offender is described as man, of slim build and around 6' 5" tall. The second offender was also a man, around 5' 3" tall and of stocky build. They were both wearing face masks.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone who was in the area and witnessed, or has CCTV or dashcam footage of, anything that may help their investigation, to get in touch.

Detective Constable Vicki Greenhoff said: "This incident has understandably left the victim and his friend very shaken up.

"Enquiries are ongoing and I urge anyone who was in the area and believes they may have seen the offenders to contact Crewe CID.

"The same goes for anyone who thinks they may know who the offenders are or have CCTV or dashcam footage of them."
