In these unprecedented times and with so much change to our normal lives, it is important to us that we ask what you think of the policing response to COVID 19 is in Cheshire.

Officers and staff are out in your community 24/7, carrying out duties on your behalf and helping to keep you safe.

Your feedback is important to us and will influence how we continue to do our duty and help us understand the service you want from your local police at this difficult time. Thank you for taking the time to complete the survey.

### **Take the survey.**
