**Detectives in Widnes investigating a robbery in which two 13-year-old boys had their bicycles stolen are appealing for information and footage from members of the public.**

The incident occurred at a park in Upton Rocks, near to the entrance to Colvend Way, at around 2.20pm on Saturday 8 February.

Two males approached the victims, who are both from Widnes, and demanded their bikes.

One of the offenders was carrying a small knife.

The victims handed their bikes over, as well as a small quantity of cash.

The offenders then rode off along Queensbury Way towards Hough Green.

They are described as white and approximately 19 years old. They both had slim builds, stubble on their faces and spoke with Liverpudlian accents.

One of the offenders was wearing a green Parajumpers jacket with the hood up.

The other had a black bubble jacket on and was wearing a grey North Face balaclava.

The bicycles they stole are GT mountain bikes. One is dark navy blue and the other is matt black.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are appealing for anyone who was in the area and witnessed anything that may be relevant to their investigation to get in touch.

They also want to speak to anyone who believes they may know who the offenders are, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of them.

Detective Inspector Ian Whiley, of Widnes Local Policing Unit, said: "The victims, both 13-year-old boys, were subjected to a terrifying ordeal that has understandably left them extremely shaken up.

"We are determined to establish the identities of the offenders, bring them to justice and have the stolen mountain bikes returned to their rightful owners.

"Enquiries are ongoing and I urge anyone who was in the area and saw anything that may aid our investigation to come forward.

"The same goes for anyone who thinks they may know who the offenders are or have CCTV or dashcam footage of them.

"We also want to speak to anyone who believes they may have seen the stolen mountain bikes since the robbery took place."

Anyone with information or footage that may help the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 631991, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
