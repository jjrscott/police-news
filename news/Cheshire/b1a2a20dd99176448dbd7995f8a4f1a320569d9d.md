**Officers investigating a burglary at a cricket club in Widnes are appealing for information from members of the public.**

Three people wearing dark clothing and hooded tops with the hoods up broke into garages at Widnes Cricket Club on Beaconsfield Road at around 8pm on Saturday 13 February.

They stole a number of items, including a large petrol-powered lawnmower that is used for cutting pitches.

The offenders also stole two standard lawnmowers, a power generator, a leaf blower and a backpack strimmer.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and officers are urging anyone with any information or footage that may aid their investigation to get in touch.

Police Constable Jamie Chambers, of Widnes Local Policing Unit, said: "We are doing everything we can to establish the identities of the offenders, make them face the consequences of their actions and have the stolen items returned to the cricket club.

"Enquiries are ongoing and we want to hear from anyone who was in the area and believes that they may have seen the offenders or anything else that may help our investigation.

"Although the items were stolen shortly after 8pm on Saturday 13 February, at around 5.30pm that day two people wearing dark clothing and hooded tops with the hoods up trespassed at the cricket club.

"They looked around the club before leaving.

"A red Nissan Micra was in the area when the burglary took place later on. However, a larger vehicle such as a van will have been needed to transport the stolen items away from the cricket club.

"With the information we have, we want to speak to anyone who witnessed anything suspicious in the Beaconsfield Road, Pit Lane and Derby Road areas of Widnes between 4.45pm and 8.30pm that day.

"We also want to talk to anyone who believes that they may having information or CCTV or dashcam footage regarding the offenders, the Nissan Micra or a larger vehicle that may have been involved in the burglary.

"The same goes for anyone with information in connection with the whereabouts of the stolen items."

Anyone with information or footage that could be relevant to the investigation is asked to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting incident number 21000097126, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
