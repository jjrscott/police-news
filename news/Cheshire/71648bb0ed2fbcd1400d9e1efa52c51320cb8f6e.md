**A 47-year-old man from Congleton has been charged with murder following the death of a woman in the town.**

David Mottram, of Nursery Lane, appeared at Warrington Magistrates' Court on Thursday 4 March and at Chester Crown Court the following day, both via a video link.

He has been remanded in custody and is set to return to the crown court on Friday 28 May.

Mottram was arrested in Nursery Lane at around 11.15pm on Tuesday 2 March after officers found the body of a woman at an address in the close that night.

She has subsequently been identified as Samantha Heap, a 45-year-old from Congleton.

Her family are being supported by specialist officers.
