**A 24-year-old man has been charged after a cannabis farm was discovered in Widnes.**

Henri Zeqo, of no fixed address, was arrested on Macdermott Road in the town shortly before 11am on Wednesday 11 November.

He has subsequently been charged with production of a class B drug and causing criminal damage.

The charges relate to a cannabis farm being discovered at an address in Cholmondeley Street, Widnes, that morning.

The cannabis plants inside the address were seized by officers, as was equipment used to cultivate them.

Zeqo has been remanded in custody and is set to appear at Warrington Magistrates' Court, via a video link, on Thursday 12 November.
