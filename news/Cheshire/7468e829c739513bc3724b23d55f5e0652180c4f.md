**Detectives are appealing for information and footage from members of the public following an aggravated burglary in Warrington.**

The incident occurred at around 9pm on Thursday 3 December.

Three men wearing balaclavas and dark clothing barged their way into a house in Wellington Street after an occupier had opened the door to them.

One of offenders, who was armed with a machete, grabbed the occupier and pushed her against a wall.

After managing to break free from him, she ran out of the house and knocked on neighbouring doors.

As she was doing so the three offenders also ran out of the house.

They fled on foot in the direction of the Star Moon Chinese takeaway.

When she returned to her home the victim discovered that a quantity of cash had been stolen.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone who was in the area and saw anything that may help their investigation to get in touch.

They also want to speak to anyone who believes they may know who the offenders are, or have dashcam or CCTV footage of them.

Detective Sergeant Alison McLoughlin, of Warrington Local Policing Unit, said: "This was a terrifying incident that has understandably left the victim extremely shaken up.

"I would like to reassure residents that this is believed to be an isolated incident and we are doing everything we can to establish the identities of the offenders and bring them to justice.

"Enquiries are ongoing and we want to hear from anyone who believes they may have relevant information or footage concerning the aggravated burglary.

"Perhaps you were in the area and saw the offenders, either before they entered the house or as they were fleeing the scene.

"Or maybe you have CCTV or dashcam footage of the men, or believe that you may know who they are."

Anyone with information or footage that may aid the ongoing investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 865433, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
