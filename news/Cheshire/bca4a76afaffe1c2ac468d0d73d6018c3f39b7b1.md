Police in Congleton are advising residents to increase the security of their sheds and valuables following a number of incidents in the area.

Officers are currently investigating four shed breaks in Oak View Marton and one in Newcastle Road Congleton which all occurred overnight on 23 November. In some cases nothing was taken and in others, power tools were taken.

Sgt Paul Brunton said: "While we continue investigate these burglaries we would urge residents to think about their security and review how they can improve it.

"In these instances, the locks were forced in order to break into the sheds so if you do have valuable such as bikes in outbuildings or sheds you may want to think about extra ways to secure them - and with Christmas round the corner, it's particularly important not to give thieves the chance. You can help us make it difficult for thieves by following a number of steps and denying them the opportunity to steal your hard earned property."

Tips on preventing shed or outbuilding burglaries:
• Check outbuildings, sheds and garages are locked and secure
• Keep windows shut when unoccupied
• Keep personal items such as bikes and gardening tools stored away and out of sight
• Invest in strong padlocks to fit to sheds and/or garages or have them fitted with an alarm
• CCTV is also an option to consider, or security lights which come on when someone walks toward it
• Look out for yourself and neighbours by reporting suspicious activity to police.
