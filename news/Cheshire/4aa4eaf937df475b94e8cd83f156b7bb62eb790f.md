Detectives are investigating a burglary at a church in Runcorn and appealing for information.

At some time between 9.30pm on Tuesday 5 November and 8am on Wednesday 6 November offender/s broke into the church on Main Street. They have then caused damage to at least five doors including one with large glass.

Detective Sergeant Rob McLoughlin, of Runcorn Local Policing Unit, said: "The church is part of the local community and popular with residents, for it to be targeted in this way is disgraceful.

"As part of our enquiries we are currently exploring a number of forensic opportunities and establishing whether anything has been stolen. Offender/s have caused significant damage inside the church and we are appealing for anyone with information to get in touch.

"Perhaps you saw some suspicious behaviour around the church between 9.30pm yesterday, into this morning or you have information which could assist with our investigation? If so, please get in touch with us."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 558206, or provide details through the website https://www.cheshire.police.uk/contact/incident-update-form/
