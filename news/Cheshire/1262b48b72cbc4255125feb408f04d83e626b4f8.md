Detectives from Macclesfield CID are appealing to the public to help trace a man who may be able to assist with their enquiries in relation an alleged robbery in Rainow.

Collins Mukonowatsauka, who is also known as Mukanu and Mukono, is 22 years old and from the Greater Manchester area.

He is described as black, of medium build and has brown eyes, short black hair and a goatee beard.

Detective Sergeant Simon Mills, of Macclesfield CID, said: "It is essential that we speak to Collins as soon as possible and I urge anyone with any information regarding his whereabouts to get in touch.

"Collins was last known to be residing in the Openshawe area of Manchester, but he has links across the city.

"I urge anyone who believes that they may know where he is not to approach him. Instead, contact Cheshire Constabulary immediately on 999, quoting IML 698717."

Alternatively, if you do not want to speak to the police, information can be reported anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
