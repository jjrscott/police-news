**Officers investigating a business burglary in Runcorn are appealing for witnesses to come forward.**

The Poundbakery in Church Street was broken into via the roof at the back of the premises.

A quantity of cash was stolen from a safe inside the bakery and the burglary occurred between 5pm on Saturday 1 February and 9.30am on Sunday 2 February.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and officers are urging anyone with any information or footage that may help their investigation to get in touch.

PC Dawn Taylor, of the Runcorn Pro-Active Policing Team, said: "Burglary is a serious offence and we are determined to establish who broke into the bakery and stole a quantity of cash.

"Enquiries are ongoing and I urge anyone who believes they may know who carried out the burglary to contact the team here at Runcorn Police Station.

"The same goes for anyone who thinks they may have seen or have footage of the offender, or offenders, either before they broke into the bakery or as they were fleeing the scene."
