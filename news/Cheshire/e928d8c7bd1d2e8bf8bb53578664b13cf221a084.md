Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a robbery in Congleton.

At 5.20pm on Saturday 19 December a 16-year-old boy was walking on West Road, near to the Cheshire Tavern, when he was approached from behind by three unknown men.

The men threatened the teenager with knives and demanded that he handed over his wallet and Canada Goose coat.

The trio then fled the scene on foot.

All three suspects were in their late teens, they were all wearing dark clothing and had their hoods up and had local accents.

Once of the men was wearing a grey North Face coat.

Detective Constable Tom Binder from Macclesfield CID said: "This was a terrifying ordeal for the victim and we are committed to doing all that we can to trace the people responsible.

"As part of the investigation into the incident I am keen to hear from anyone who was in the area around the time it occurred and believes they may have witnessed something that may be relevant to our enquiries.

"I also want to hear from motorists with dashcams who were driving on West Road between 5.00pm and 5.45pm."

Anyone with any information which may assist the investigation, no matter how small, is urged to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 877523 or give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report .

Alternatively, information can be reported to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously .
