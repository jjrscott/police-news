**Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a burglary in Stockton Heath.**

At around 4am on Sunday 2 August an unknown male is believed to have gained entry to a property on Whitefield Road while an elderly couple were at home.

A quantity of cash and jewellery were stolen from the property.

Officers are now appealing for anyone with information that could help with their investigation to get in touch.

Detective Constable Vicky Hancox said: "This was no doubt a particularly frightening incident and a number of enquiries are currently ongoing.

"The jewellery taken during the burglary is of great sentimental value to the victims and I would urge anyone who may have seen anyone acting suspiciously around the time of the incident in the Whitefield Road area to come forward.

"The same goes for anyone who may have captured CCTV or dashcam footage in the surrounding areas.

"We are doing everything possible to trace those responsible and I would urge anyone with any information, no matter how big or small, to get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to call Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 769708 or report it via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report

Information can also be passed on to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
