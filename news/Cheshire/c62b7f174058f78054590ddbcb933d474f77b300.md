**Detectives investigating an arson attack in Ellesmere Port are appealing for information and footage from members of the public.**

At around 12.30am on Wednesday 18 March a fire was started at a house in Pooltown Road, Whitby.

No-one was at home at the time.

The fire caused extensive damage to the hallway before it was extinguished by firefighters.

Smoke from the fire caused damage throughout the house.

An investigation into the cause of the fire has revealed that it was started deliberately.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone with any information or CCTV or dashcam footage that may help their investigation to get in touch.

Detective Inspector Nigel Parr, of Ellesmere Port Local Policing Unit, said: "At that time of night people are usually asleep in bed.

"Thankfully, no-one was in the house when the fire was started and firefighters were able to put it out before it had chance to spread to neighbouring properties.

"The fire caused extensive damage to the house but the consequences of this incident could have been far worse. It could have put lives at risk.

"I would like to reassure members of the community that this is believed to be an isolated incident and we are determined to establish who started the fire and bring them to justice.

"Enquiries are ongoing and as part of our investigation we want to speak to anyone who was in the area and witnessed anything suspicious.

"We also want to hear from anyone who thinks they may know who started the fire, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of them."

Anyone with information or footage that may aid the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 663153, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
