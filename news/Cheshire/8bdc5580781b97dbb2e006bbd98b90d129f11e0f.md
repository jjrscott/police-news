**Detectives are appealing for information from members of the public following a serious assault in Widnes town centre.**

A 26-year-old man from the town was attacked by a group of three or four males as he walked along an alleyway between Kingsway and Sharp Street.

The incident, which occurred at around 7.30pm on Sunday 31 May, left the victim with a serious facial injury.

He was taken to hospital in an ambulance and has since been discharged after receiving treatment.

The offenders were wearing dark clothing and had their faces covered with masks and balaclavas.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone who was in the area and witnessed anything that may aid their investigation to get in touch.

They also want to speak to anyone who believes they may know the identities of the offenders, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of them.

Detective Constable Gary McClatchey, of Widnes CID, said: "This was a terrifying incident that left the victim with a serious facial injury and extremely shaken up.

"I would like to reassure residents that this appears to be an isolated incident and we are determined to establish the identities of those responsible for the unprovoked assault and bring them to justice.

"As part of our enquiries we want to hear from anyone who was in the area that night and believes they may have seen something relevant to our investigation.

"We also want to speak to anyone who thinks they may know who the offenders are, or have footage of them."

Anyone with information or CCTV or dashcam footage that could help the ongoing investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 772051, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
