**A 55-year-old man has been jailed for 18 months for drug offences after cannabis with a total street value of around Â£6,000 was seized during a warrant in Runcorn.**

Ian Ainge, of Davenport Row, was arrested and subsequently charged with possession with intent to supply class B drugs (cannabis) and possession of class C drugs (tramadol) when officers executed a warrant at an address at around 12.30pm on Friday 29 May.

Officers recovered a quantity of cannabis, tramadol, cash and a number of weapons including a machete and a stun gun.

Ainge pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment at Chester Crown Court on Tuesday 21 July.

Sergeant Phil Brown of Runcorn Beat Team said: "This was a great result for the Runcorn Beat Team following an investigation into drug dealing in the town.

"I hope that this result will act as a deterrence to those who believe that they can get away with drug activities in Runcorn.

"Illegal drugs can have a detrimental impact on the local community, so it is crucial that we work to stamp out this type of crime.

"If you have any information about drug offences in your area then please contact Cheshire Police via 101, or by visiting https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report/.

"Alternatively, information can be passed on to Crimestoppers anonymously via 0800 555 111 or by visiting https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously."

Police and Crime Commissioner David Keane said: "Officers across the Constabulary are working tirelessly to end the misery that illegal drugs can bring to communities.

"I am pleased that Runcorn's beat management team have prevented these drugs from reaching the town's streets and although this investigation has now concluded, I know that Cheshire Constabulary's fight against those who blight our neighbourhood with illegal drugs continues.

"I would urge anyone with information about suspected drug activity in their community to contact Cheshire Police."
