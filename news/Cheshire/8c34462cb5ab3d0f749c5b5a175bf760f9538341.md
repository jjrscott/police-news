**Residents are being reminded of the ways in which they can contact Cheshire Constabulary during this lockdown period.**

During this time it will very much be business as usual for the force with a few small changes in the way the public can contact us.

Weekly surgeries in each of the 122 community areas will now be held in alternative formats, with meetings and contact arranged directly with the local Police Constable and Police Community Support Officer.

Each area will be holding their regular meetings online or by telephone conference in a bid to maintain their relationship with their community bases.

Officers can also arrange a COVID-safe visit to your home, at police stations or at their community base.

When attending a helpdesk during opening hours the public will be asked to press button 2 on the yellow telephone outside.

They will then speak to helpdesk staff who will ask a series of screening questions in relation to coronavirus to assist us in safeguarding our staff and other members of the public.

If there are no concerns in relation to health, the member of public will be given access and can speak to the helpdesk staff.

The public can continue to contact the force by calling 101 or online via the Cheshire Police website.

To report a coronavirus breach, please visit our dedicated website page.

**In an emergency, where a crime is taking place or there is a danger to life, always dial 999.**
