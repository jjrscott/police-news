A drug dealer who police stop-checked for speeding in Runcorn Old Town has been jailed for two years and eight months.

Billy Moores of Handforth Lane, Runcorn appeared at Chester Crown Court today (Friday 1 May) and pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply class A drugs (cocaine) at his first hearing. He was subsequently sentenced.

The 32-year-old was spotted by police at 2.12pm on 3 April driving above the speed limit. They briefly lost sight of the vehicle but located the car parked in a parking bay on Mersey Road and saw Moores getting out of his vehicle.

The officers searched Moores and the vehicle, discovering 44 wraps of cocaine worth between £1,320 and £4,400. He also had in his possession £900 in cash.

Inspector Fez Khan said: "This was cracking work by our officers and demonstrates their determination to rid Runcorn of those who cause misery in our communities by selling illegal drugs.

"Moores early guilty plea is testament to the quality of the investigation by our officers.

"I hope this goes as a warning to others that we are still out there actively patrolling the streets of Cheshire, keeping our communities safe and criminals off the streets."
