Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a teenager was assaulted in Winsford.

During the early hours of Sunday 29 December a 16-year-old male was walking on Whitby's Lane when he was approached by an unknown man.

The offender then fled on a bike travelling in the direction of Oakview Academy.

He is described as white, 6ft tall, of a stocky build and aged around 19 to 24-years-old with brown hair and a thick long moustache.

He was wearing a black bubbly padded jacket with black pants and is believed to have had a black mountain bike.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who may have been in the area around the time of the incident and may have seen anything suspicious.
