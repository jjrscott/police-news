**Detectives investigating an attempted robbery in Widnes are appealing for information and footage from members of the public.**

The incident occurred at a newsagent on Victoria Road at around 9.15pm on Monday 15 March.

Two teenage boys entered the store wearing face coverings and dark clothing.

One of them brandished a hammer and demanded alcohol from a man working behind the counter.

The man challenged the boys, who then fled the shop empty-handed.

They ran off towards Ashley Way.

Another teenage boy who was stood outside during the incident ran off in the opposite direction, towards Kingsway.

He was also wearing dark clothing and a face covering.

The two teenagers who entered the store were both white.

The boy who brandished a hammer and demanded alcohol was wearing a black puffer jacket and black pants.

He was carrying a black bag around his neck and spoke with a local accent.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone with any information or footage that may aid their investigation to get in touch.

Detective Constable Anthony Evans, of Widnes CID, said: "This was a frightening incident that understandably left the man who was working at the shop shaken up.

"There were no customers in the shop at the time of the attempted robbery.

"It is believed to be an isolated incident and we are determined to establish the identities of the teenage boys and deal with them accordingly.

"Enquiries are ongoing and I urge anyone who was in the Victoria Road area of the town centre around the time of the incident to contact us at Widnes Police Station if they saw anything that may help our investigation.

"The same goes for anyone who thinks they may know who the teenage boys are, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of them."

Anyone with information or footage that may be relevant to the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 939444, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
