The family of a 15-year-old boy whose body has been discovered in Ashley have paid tribute to him.

His body was discovered outside in Ashley Mill Lane shortly before 8am on Friday 13 December.

The family of the teenage boy from the Knutsford area have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers.

In a joint statement, the family said: "He was a very loving, caring, kind, loyal and, most of all, trusting young boy.

"He loved life and made friends wherever he went.

"He will be sorely missed."

Detective Chief Inspector Simon Blackwell, of Cheshire Constabulary's Major Crime Directorate, said: "Our thoughts are with the boy's family at this extremely difficult time.

"They are currently being supported by specialist officers and we request for their privacy to be respected."
