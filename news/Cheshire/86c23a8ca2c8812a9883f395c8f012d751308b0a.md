**Detectives are appealing for information following an attempted robbery at a shop in Birchwood.**

At around 8.40pm on Sunday 13 September an unknown man entered the shop on Admirals Road and demanded money.

It is believed he was in possession of a knife and a canister he claimed contained acid.

He then attempted to enter the till area but was stopped by a staff member.

The man then fled the scene.

As a result of the incident the shop worker sustained minor injuries to his hand.

The offender is described as white, around 5'7" to 5'10" and of average build.

He was wearing a black face mask, a dark hoody, dark trousers and light coloured trainers.

Officers are now urging anyone with information about the incident to get in touch.

Detective Constable Jill Peggs said: "This incident has not only left the member of staff with slight injuries but also incredibly shaken.

"We are doing all we can to find the offender responsible and bring him to justice while a number of enquiries are ongoing.

"I would urge anyone who may have seen anything around the time of the incident to get in touch.

"Also I would like to ask anyone who may have captured dashcam or CCTV footage of the suspect to call Cheshire Police on 101."

Anyone with information is urged to call Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 804376 or report it via the Cheshire Police website.

Information can be passed on to Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 or report it via the Crimestoppers website.
