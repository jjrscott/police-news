**Detectives are appealing for witnesses and dashcam footage after a man was seriously assaulted outside a petrol station in Crewe.**

At around 2.40am on Sunday 15 December a 33-year-old man visited the Esso petrol station on Victoria Avenue with his partner.

After leaving the store the man was assaulted by a group of four unknown white men.

Following the attack the men fled the scene in a silver car, similar to a Vauxhall Astra, travelling in the direction of West Street.

The victim, who is from the local area, sustained serious facial injuries as a result of the incident and is currently recovering in hospital.

Detective Constable Kevin Lloyd, from Crewe CID, said: "A man suffered serious injuries as a result of this incident and we are committed to doing all that we can to establish exactly what has taken place.

"As part of my investigation I want to hear from anyone who believes they may have witnessed the incident or anyone with any information which may aid our investigation.

"The same goes for any motorists who were driving past the Esso Petrol station between 2.30pm and 3.00am on Sunday 15 December and believes they may have captured the incident, or the silver vehicle, on their dashcams."
