A Macclesfield sex offender has been jailed after arranging to meet a girl under 16 and failing to adhere to his Sexual Harm Prevention Order.

James Rowe, 34, from Torr Road, Macclesfield appeared at Chester Crown Court on Thursday 21 May and was sentenced to seven years in prison.

He pleaded guilty to two counts of breaching a Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO) and inciting a child to engage in sexual activity at an earlier hearing.

The breaches relate to continuing to be in contact with children, not declaring an online address and possession of a mobile phone.

The breaches came to light following a spot check from the designated sexual offender liaison officer acting on information. An investigation followed and revealed Rowe was in possession of mobile phones, which he denied when asked, and was inappropriately messaging girls under the age of 16 under aliases.

DC Chris Jackson said: "Rowe is back behind bars because of his continued behaviour. I hope this sends a message to those with a SHPO that we are monitoring you.

"I hope this also reassures residents and that our designated sexual offender liaison officers take their role and the safety of the public extremely seriously."
