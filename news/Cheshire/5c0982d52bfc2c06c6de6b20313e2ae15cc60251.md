At around 4.15pm on Wednesday 25 December emergency services were called to a serious collision on Macclesfield Road in North Rode.

Officers attended the scene and discovered that a white Audi RS5 and a Volkswagen Up had been involved in a collision.

Sadly the driver of the Volkswagen Up, a 46-year-old woman from Rainow, died at the scene.

Her next of kin have been informed and are currently being supported by specialist officers.

The driver of the Audi, a man from Stockport, was arrested on suspicion of drug driving and death by dangerous driving.

He has since been released under investigation.

Officers want to speak to anyone who may have seen the white Audi RS5 or the Volkswagen UP before the collision on the A536.

**Any witnesses or anyone with information about the collision should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 597190.**
