Officers are appealing for information from the public after vandals damaged a series of bus stops in Warrington.

Significant damage was caused to around a dozen bus stops on the A57 Manchester Road, between Helsby Street and Junction 21 of the M6.

Numerous windows were smashed during a series of incidents which occurred between 8pm and 10.30pm on Saturday 14 December.

Enquiries in relation to the incidents are ongoing and officers are urging anyone with any information or footage that may aid their investigation to get in touch.

Police Constable Alison Edwards, who is leading the investigation on behalf of Warrington Local Policing Unit, said: "Bus stops on both sides of the road were damaged over an approximate three-mile distance.

"We are determined to establish who is responsible for the mindless acts of vandalism and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"Enquiries are ongoing and we want to speak to anyone who was in the area and believes they may have witnessed something that may be relevant to our investigation.

"Perhaps you witnessed a bus stop being damaged or saw whoever was responsible for the vandalism.

"We also want to hear from anyone who thinks they may know who caused the criminal damage, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of them."

Warrington Borough Council has confirmed that it will cost thousands of pounds to repair the damaged bus stops.

Cllr Hans Mundry, cabinet member for transportation, highways and public realm, said: "Vandalism to our bus stops causes a real blight in our communities and we are determined to identify those who carry out this criminal activity.

"I am appalled by these destructive acts, carried out over such a wide area, and I urge anyone with any information to assist the police with their investigation."

**Anyone with information or footage that may help the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 588775, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.**
