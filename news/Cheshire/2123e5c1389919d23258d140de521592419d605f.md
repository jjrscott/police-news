Detectives investigating an attempted murder in Warrington have released a CCTV image of a man they would like trace.

At 11.15am on Saturday 21 March a 35-year-old man suffered serious head injuries after being assaulted on Old Liverpool Road.

The victim, from Widnes, presented himself at Warrington Hospital and has since been released.

Enquiries in relation to the attempted murder are ongoing.

Detectives are urging anyone who believes they may know the identity of the man in the CCTV footage to get in touch.

Detective Sergeant John Rhodes, who is leading the investigation, said: "This was a horrific assault which took place in the middle of the street during a busy time of day.

"The victim received hospital treatment for serious injuries to his head caused by a weapon and has now been released from hospital.

"As part of our ongoing enquiries I am looking to trace the man in the CCTV image who I believe has a Scottish accent.

"If you think you recognise him or know who he is please get in touch with us.

"I would also appeal directly to the man in the image to contact police."

A 42-year-old man arrested on suspicion of attempted murder has been released with no further action.
