**Officers are appealing for information from members of the public after a man was assaulted and had money stolen from him in Runcorn.**

The victim, a 31-year-old from Warrington, was walking along a footpath in Norton when the incident occurred at around 8pm on Friday 14 August.

After being asked for a light by a group of three males walking in the opposite direction, he dropped a quantity of cash.

The group then assaulted him and stole his money before fleeing in the direction of Runcorn East Railway Station.

The victim is believed to have only sustained minor injuries as a result of the incident. He did not go to hospital.

The group of males all looked to be around 20 years old.

One of them was wearing a full blue Adidas tracksuit. He was white, had a muscular looking face and spoke with a Liverpudlian accent.

Another of the group was also white. He was wearing blue Nike shorts and a T-shirt, as well as a surgical-type face covering.

The third member of the group had a bubble jacket on.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and officers are urging anyone with any information or footage that may aid their investigation to get in touch.

Police Constable Amy Lally, of Runcorn Local Policing Unit, said: "This was a frightening incident that has understandably left the victim shaken up.

"I would like to reassure members of the community that this is believed to be an isolated incident and we are determined to establish the identities of the three males and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"Enquiries are ongoing and I urge anyone who was in the area and saw anything that may help our investigation to contact us at Runcorn Police Station.

"The same goes for anyone who thinks they may know who the group of males are, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of them."

Anyone with information or footage that may be relevant to the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 780565, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
