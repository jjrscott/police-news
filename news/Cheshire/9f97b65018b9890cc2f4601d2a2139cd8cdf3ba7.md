Cheshire Constabulary's principal purpose is to make people safe and feel safe. It is important that the Constabulary provides a service to the diverse communities that it serves and, as such, is currently reviewing the equality objectives that were set in 2016. These objectives are also required by law as set out in the 2010 Equality Act.

The 2010 Equality Act introduced the public sector equality duty, referred to as the general equality duty with three aims: to eliminate unlawful conduct prohibited by the act; to advance equality of opportunity and to foster good relations between those who share a protected characteristic and those who do not.

Deputy Chief Constable Julie Cooke said: "We are currently undertaking a review of our equality objectives and we are keen to hear from the public, particularly those who are from a minority community

"It is important that we provide the correct level of service to all our communities.

"We encourage the communities within Cheshire to take part in this consultation to help us shape the policing of the county by having your say.

"The feedback that we receive will help to inform the review to ensure the 2020 objectives reflect what is important to our communities"
