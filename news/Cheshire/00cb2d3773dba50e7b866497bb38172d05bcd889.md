Police are appealing for witnesses after two shop robberies in Northwich.

At 7.07pm on 18 March police received a report of a robbery at a convenience store in Clifton Drive, Leftwich.

A male entered McColls and threatened staff with a firearm before fleeing the scene empty handed. A short time later police received another report of a man at The Spar in London Road. On this occasion a male fled with cash.

Officers, supported by armed officers, made a search of the area but the suspect was not located.

The suspect is described as male, white, around 5ft 8ins tall and in his early 20s. He is average build with blue/grey eyes. There were a few blond streaks of hair showing from under his hood. He was wearing a slim-fitting, grey Northface hooded puffer jacket and grey trousers. He was also wearing a woolly black face covering up to the bridge of his nose.

Police are making enquiries in the area and are appealing for anyone with information to contact police.
