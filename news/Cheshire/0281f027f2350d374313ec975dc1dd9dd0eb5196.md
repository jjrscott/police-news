Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an assault in Northwich town centre.

At around 2.15am on Saturday 2nd November officers were called to reports of an altercation between a group of men outside the Barons Quay Social.

Officers attended the scene and found that a number of people had been injured during the incident.

Two local men, age 19 and 20, were arrested on suspicion of assault in relation to the incident. They have since been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and as part of the investigation officers are appealing for information from the public.

Detective Constable Neil Wharmby, from Northwich CID, said: "This investigation is currently in the early stages and we are doing everything we can to establish exactly what took place.

"The altercation took place outside a busy town centre bar and as part of my enquiries I'm keen to hear from anyone who was present at the time of the incident and believes they may have witnessed what happened.

"I'd urge anyone with any information, no matter how small, to contact the team here at Northwich on 101."

Anyone with information should call 101, quoting IML 554778. Alternatively you can provide information anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
