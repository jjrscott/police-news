**Police are appealing for information from the public after a defibrillator was stolen from outside a children 's centre on Norton Hill in Runcorn.**

At around 7am on Thursday 12 November a member of staff at Windmill Hill children's centre discovered that it had been stolen.

An unknown person had forced open the box, which is located at the rear of the building, and stole the machine.

Inspector Leeroy Moss, of Runcorn Local Policing Unit, said: "To stoop as low as to steal a defibrillator is simply despicable and I cannot understand why anyone would commit such an offence.

"Besides this item being an expensive piece of equipment, the fact that it could potentially save lives means it is an invaluable asset to your local community.

"I would urge anyone with any information in relation to the theft to contact the team here at Runcorn on 101 so that we can ensure that the people responsible are brought to justice."

Anyone with information is urged to contact Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 849860 or report it to us via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report

Alternatively, information can be passed on to Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 or via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
