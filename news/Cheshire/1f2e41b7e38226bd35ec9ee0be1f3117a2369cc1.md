**Detectives are still urging people to come forward with information following a shooting in Crewe.**

A man is believed to have approached a group of people in an alleyway at the rear of Brooklyn Street and Nelson Street and a shot was fired.

The incident took place at around 2am on Wednesday 4 November.

A 23-year-old man received a injury to his arm and received treatment at hospital later the same day (Wednesday 4 November).

Since then an investigation has been underway to establish the full circumstances and gather information and evidence.

Officers from the local policing unit have been at the scene conducting a number of enquiries and patrolling the area to reassure the local community.

Detective Inspector Claire Jesson, from Crewe Local Policing Unit, said: "Our investigation remains ongoing and I am still keen to hear from anyone who has any information to please get in touch.

"I appreciate this is a concerning incident for those living in the area however I still believe it is not a random attack.

"I want to further reassure residents that we are working around the clock to do everything we can to find those involved.

"You will still see officers patrolling the area and I would encourage anyone with any concerns to speak to them.

"If you do not feel comfortable speaking to police directly please contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
