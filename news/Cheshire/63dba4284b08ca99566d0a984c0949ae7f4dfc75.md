A Cranage family are appealing for items from a shrine to their son to be returned after making the devastating discovery that someone had removed them.

The family, who live on the Cranage estate, had agreed with family and friends, and with no objections from the parish council, to put up a shrine to their 18-year-old son, Liam Slattery, who sadly died after an asthma attack. There was also a bench installed next to the memorial.

PCSO Liz Chesters said: "The items put on the shrine had personal meaning to those who knew and loved Liam who used to play for Holmes Chapel football Club.

"His friends, when they came home from university, would often visit the memorial and leave little tokens or flowers to pay tribute to a much missed friend.

"The items had personal meaning, so to lose them has caused his family and friends great distress. I would urge anyone who knows where the items are to return them. The family just want them back as it is causing them a lot of upset and anguish."

If you have information on the missing items you can contact Cheshire Police on 101 or email crewe.lpu@cheshire.pnn.police.uk quoting incident number 19100646412.
