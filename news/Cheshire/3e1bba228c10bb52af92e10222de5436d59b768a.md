Detectives have released CCTV images of three people they would like to speak to in relation to a serious assault at a bar in Northwich.

At 1.25am on 5 September a confrontation broke out between a group of men at the Quayside in Whitton Street as they were asked to leave the premises.

DC Helen Harrison said: "A man in his 30s was seriously injured and required hospital treatment.

"I'm keen to speak to anyone who recognises the men in the CCTV or saw the incident but has not yet spoken to us.

"I'd also appeal directly to the men to come forward and help us with our investigation."

Anyone with information should contact Cheshire Police on 101 or via www.cheshire.police.uk quoting IML 799895.

Alternatively information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
