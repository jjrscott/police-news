An Oldham man has been jailed for ATM thefts in Northwich and a burglary in Willaston.

Marian Barbu, from Kervelow Street was sentenced to five years in prison at Chester Crown Court on Thursday 19 December

The 23-year-old had earlier been found guilty by a jury of burglary at a house on Hooton Road, Willaston which occurred on 13 July 2018.

He also pleaded guilty for three theft offences in Northwich on 30 May, 6 June and 19 June 2019.

During the burglary Barbu entered the house while the occupants were out and stole jewellery and watches to the value of £4430\. Barbu left a cigarette at the scene and his DNA was found on this linking him to the incident. The DNA hit led officers to Barbu who also goes by the name of Marian Spirache.

During their investigation officers also linked Barbu to three theft offences in Northwich. On each occasion Barbu targeted elderly victims at the Halifax ATM in Northwich Town Centre.

During these offences he waited until they had entered their PIN numbers into the ATM and then approached them with a receipt and convinced them the ATM had not given him his money, he then withdrew large sums from the victims accounts which totalled £1,450 which he claimed was his money from the transaction before.

When Barbu was subsequently arrested on 24 June 2019 at his home Oldham, he claimed to be a Marian Spirache and denied being Barbu, however his identity was confirmed via his fingerprints.

DC Roy Wellings said: "Barbu stole money from elderly people and burgled a house during his spree in Cheshire, but thankfully he was caught before he could target further victims thanks to our DNA hit. Being a victim of theft or burglary can be very traumatic so I hope this sentence helps those affected come to terms with their ordeals in some way."
