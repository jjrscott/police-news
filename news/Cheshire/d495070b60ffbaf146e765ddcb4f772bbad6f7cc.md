Detectives are appealing for witnesses and dashcam footage after a man was stabbed in Tarporley.

Just before 5am on Friday 31 January officers were called following reports that a man driving a milk float had been assaulted on Eaton Road near the junction of Cobblers Cross.

It is believed that two males asked the man for a lift before attempting to steal some milk.

The two males assaulted the man who then sustained minor injuries.

He was treated at the scene by paramedics.

The two males then fled the scene towards a nearby field.

One of the males is described as being around 15 to 16-years-old, around 6' of slim build with short dark hair.

He was wearing dark-rimmed glasses and a black puffa-style coat with a small white logo.

The other male is described as white, aged 13 to 15-years-old, around 5' 4" of medium build and was wearing dark coloured clothing.

Officers are now appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the incident or may have caught dashcam footage of the suspects to come forward.

Detective Constable James Elliott, who is leading the investigation, said: "Over the last week we have been investigating several lines of enquiry.

"Thankfully the injuries sustained by the victim were minor and we are determined to track down those responsible and bring them to justice.

"We have been made aware that there was a school trip setting off around the time of the incident so there would have been people in the area who may have caught dashcam footage.

"I also want to hear from anyone else who has not yet come forward and may have key information that could help with our investigation."

Anyone who may have witnessed the incident or may have caught dashcam footage is urged to call 101 quoting IML 625126 or report it via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/
