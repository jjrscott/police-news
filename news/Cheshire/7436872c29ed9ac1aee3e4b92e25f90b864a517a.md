Detectives investigating a series of armed robberies at convenience stores across the region have charged eight men in connection with the incidents.

Daniel Adamson, 33; Christopher Burke, 24; Michael Burke, 38; Connor Kedie, 21; Michael Kedie, 28; Robert Lewis, 45; Anthony Watson, 32; and Jack Yarwood, 34, were arrested following a joint investigation by Cheshire Constabulary and Greater Manchester Police into a series of armed robberies at convenience stores across the region.

The men, who are all from the Greater Manchester area, have since been charged with conspiracy to commit robbery.

The charges relate to a total of 29 armed robberies, including six in Cheshire, which all occurred between 12 May 2019 and 21 November.

They included incidents in Lymm, Warrington, Macclesfield and Knutsford.

All eight men have been remanded in custody and are next due to appear at Manchester Crown Court on Wednesday 12 February.
