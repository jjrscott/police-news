**Detectives are appealing for information following a burglary at a home in Nantwich.**

Two men are believed to have forced entry to a property on Weaver Road sometime between 12pm and 1pm on Friday 4 December.

They made an untidy search and took a quantity of cash and jewellery before fleeing the property in the direction of Barony Park.

Officers are now appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the incident or may have any information to come forward.

Detective Constable Jackson said: "I would like to reassure the community that we have a number of enquiries underway to find those responsible.

"As a result we know that the two offenders fled on foot towards Barony Park.

"As part of our enquiries we would like to speak to anyone who was in the Weaver Road area at the time of the incident and may have seen something that didn't look quite right.

"We would also urge anyone who may have caught dashcam or CCTV footage from around the area between 12pm and 1pm to get in touch with us.

"Any bit of information, no matter how small, could help us bring the offenders to justice."

Anyone with information is urged to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101 quoting IML 865978 or report it to us via the Cheshire Police website.

Alternatively, information can also be provided through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or report it via the Crimestoppers website.
