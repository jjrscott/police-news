**Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a quantity of cigarettes were stolen during a burglary at a convenience store in Sandbach**.

At around 2.50am on Tuesday 26 November four unknown suspects broke into Co-op store on the A533, Middlewich Road, via the roof.

Once inside the building the suspects, who were wearing dark clothing and gloves, stole a large quantity of cigarettes.

They left the property at around 3.10am and fled the scene in a car travelling in the direction of Middlewich.

Detective Constable Scott Marshall-Bowater, from Crewe CID, said: "This was a serious incident and we are committed to doing all that we can to trace the people responsible.

"The investigation is currently in its early stages and we're following a number of lines of enquiry, including CCTV and forensics.

"Middlewich Road is busy road, both with local residents and HGVs, and as part of the investigation I want to hear from anyone who was in the area between 2.50am and 3.10am on Tuesday 26 November and witnessed anything suspicious.

"The same goes for any motorists who drove past the store around the time of the incident and believes they may have captured the offenders on their dashcams.

"I urge anyone with any information, no matter how small, to call the team here at Warrington on 101, quoting IML 574005."

Information and dashcam footage can also be submitted online at https://www.cheshire.police.uk or anonymously, via Crimestoppers, on 0800 555 111.
