The Serious and Organised Crime Unit (SOCU) have charged five people with drug offences following an operation to target organised crime in Warrington.

All five have been charged with conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and will appear at Warrington Magistrates Court on Thursday 28 May.

Ryan Baker, 31, from Bridgewater Avenue, Latchford was charged with two counts of conspiracy to supply Class A.

Nadia Khatib-Shahid, 32, from Durley Avenue, Cheetham Hill was charged with two counts of conspiracy to supply Class A.

Matthew Parrack, 39, from Bridgewater Avenue, Latchford was charged with two counts of conspiracy to supply Class A.

Thomas Rayment, 29, from Brookvale Close, Burtonwood was charged with two counts of conspiracy to supply Class A and possession of a taser.

Sheldon Simpson, 27, of no fixed abode but from Rochdale, was charged with two counts of conspiracy to supply Class A.

All were remanded in custody.

The charge relates to arrests made on Wednesday 27 May as part of a number of early morning warrants in Warrington, Rochdale and Cheetham Hill in-connection with a serious and organised crime operation involving the supply of cocaine and heroin.

After the warrants took place local officers carried out patrols to provide reassurance to the community.
