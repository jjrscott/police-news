Detectives investigating a report of a serious sexual assault in Poynton are appealing for witnesses.

The incident took place around 7.45pm - 8.15pm on Sunday 21 March in the Middlewood Road, Coppice Road area and officers have since made an arrest following their extensive enquiries. As part of the investigation, police are keen to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time and saw a van parked in the road.

DI Duncan Gouck said: "There has been a significant police presence while officers have been making a number of enquiries in the area, including door to door and CCTV. We understand this incident will be of concern to many and we want to reassure that this appears to be an isolated incident and we have made an arrest. The 14-year-old victim is being supported by specialist officers.

"We'd ask anyone who was in the area between 7pm and 8.15pm and has dash cam footage to check their footage in case there is anything that may help us with our enquiries. Or if you were in the area and saw a teenage girl and a man together with a van please get in touch."

A 53-year-old man has since been released on conditional bail.

Anyone with information should contact Cheshire Police on 101 or via the website quoting IML 944830. Alternatively information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
