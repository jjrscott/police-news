Detectives from Cheshire Police have charged a fifth man in connection with a series of high value thefts across the country.

Alin Malai was arrested at Luton Airport on Sunday 22 November as part of an ongoing investigation into a series of thefts at supermarkets across the UK.

The 27-year-old, of Belvidere Road, Liverpool, has since been charged with conspiracy to steal from a shop.

He appeared at Warrington Magistrates Court on Tuesday 24 November where he was remanded in custody.

Malai is the fifth person to be charged as part of the investigation which is being led by officers from Northwich CID.

The other four defendants, Forin Costea (51) of Darwin Street, Oldham, Stefan Florin (31) of HMP Risley, Marius Meiosu (25) of Darwin Street, Oldham and Mocanu (36) of Darwin Street, Oldham, have also been charged with conspiracy to steal from a shop.

The charges relate to a series of thefts at supermarkets across the UK, including stores in Cheshire, Lancashire, Manchester, Birmingham, Wales, West Yorkshire, Scotland and Derbyshire.

The total value of the items stolen during the thefts is believed to be in the region of Â£200,000, which occurred between 20 March 2020 and 3 September 2020.

All five defendants have been remanded in custody and are set to stand trial at Chester Crown Court in March 2021.
