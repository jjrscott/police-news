**Update - We're currently fully booked, however you may be able to make a reservation on our waiting list.**

**Cheshire Constabulary is to host a 'social value' event next month encouraging local businesses to consider bidding for contracts with the police and to demonstrate how taking such an ethical approach can bring great benefits to the community.**

The event, to be held on the morning of Wednesday 12 February, is an opportunity for firms across Cheshire to learn of the various tenders that may soon become available and how their products and services can support the work of the Constabulary. It will also provide an opportunity for local businesses to be shown how to access the Constabulary's contract database and tendering system.

Attendees will also be given up-to-date advice and guidance on business crime and learn more about how to develop their own approaches to social value through supporting for instance Constabulary volunteering schemes. The event will also cover how third sector bodies can understand and identify commissioning opportunities with the Constabulary.

Registration for the event will open at 8.00am, for an 8.30am start at the Constabulary's headquarters in Oakmere Road, Winsford. Book your place early by visiting https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/social-value-event-tickets-89996099757 as numbers are limited.

The event is being held as the Constabulary launch their Social Value and Ethical Procurement Policy which will support more local businesses to provide contracts to the police.

Police and Crime Commissioner David Keane will welcome businesses to the event on 12 February, and said:

"These new policies clarify our commitment to ensuring the contracts we procure have social, economic and environmental benefits for the local community.

"The Chief Constable and I are committed to putting Cheshire first and, where possible, supporting local businesses to provide our services whilst still delivering value for money, providing local jobs and reducing environmental impacts.

"I am looking forward to meeting lots of local businesses at this event and encouraging them to tender to work with Cheshire Constabulary. We have a 'leadership' role to play within our communities and I believe we can raise the profile and benefits of social value approaches through this event."

Registration for the event will open at 8.00am, for an 8.30am start at the Constabulary's headquarters in Oakmere Road, Winsford. Book your place early by visiting https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/social-value-event-tickets-89996099757 as numbers are limited.
