**Detectives investigating a burglary in Winsford are appealing for information and footage from members of the public.**

Two electric off-road motorbikes, two motorised mountain bikes and a quad bike were stolen from a shed in the back garden of an address in Wilkinson Way at around 4am on Friday 12 February.

The owners were asleep in their house at the time of the shed break-in.

Two males were seen riding off on two of the bikes in the direction of Dover Drive following the burglary.

The stolen bikes were:

 * A DECOY Pro 29 Black Magic M motorised mountain bike, in black with blue accents
 * A DECOY Elite Dark Slate M motorised mountain bike, in graphite with gold accents
 * A blue, black and white Sur-Ron Light Bee electric off-road motorbike
 * A blue and yellow Sur-Ron electric off-road motorbike
 * A mustard and black Yamaha quad bike.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing.

Detectives have released photographs of the stolen bikes and are urging anyone with any information or footage that may aid their investigation to get in touch.

Detective Constable Paul Matchett said: "We are determined to establish who broke into the shed and stole the bikes and then bring them to justice.

"We are also determined to have the stolen bikes returned to the owners.

"Enquiries are ongoing and as part of our investigation we want to speak to anyone who was in the area and witnessed anything suspicious.

"It would have taken five people to ride the bikes away from the area, unless a vehicle such as a van was utilised by the offenders.

"If you think that you may have CCTV or dashcam footage of the offenders, either before or after they stole the bikes, please get in touch.

"The same goes for anyone who believes that they may know the identities of the offenders or where the stolen bikes are.

"We also want to hear from anyone who is offered the chance to buy any of the stolen bikes."

Anyone with information or footage that may be relevant to the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 915912, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
