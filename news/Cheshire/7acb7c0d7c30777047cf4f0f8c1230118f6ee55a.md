**Detectives are appealing for information from the public following a robbery in Warrington.**

A man was walking along Hudson Close near the junction of Old Hall Road in Old Hall with three other people when the incident occurred at around 11.15pm on Saturday 12 December.

As the group approached the junction a man, armed with a knife, demanded they each empty their pockets. The offender then stole the man's mobile phone.

He then ran from the scene along Hudson close.

The offender is described as slim, around 5'9" in height and he was wearing a black top with a black balaclava.

Enquiries in relation to the robbery are ongoing and detectives are appealing for witnesses and for anyone who may have CCTV or dash cam footage of the area around the time of the incident to get in touch.

Detective Constable Joe Davies, from Warrington CID, said: "This has understandably left the victim and his friends extremely shaken. Thankfully no one in the group was injured.

"Enquiries are ongoing and I urge anyone who was in the area and may have information or dash cam footage to get in touch.

"I am also keen for anyone who has CCTV operating in the Hudson Close or Shackleton Close areas to come forward."

If you have information, CCTV or dash cam footage that may help the investigation please call Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 872444.

Information can also be provided anonymously by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
