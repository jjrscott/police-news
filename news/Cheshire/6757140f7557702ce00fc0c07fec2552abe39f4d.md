**Detectives are appealing for information following an arson attack in Warrington.**

At around 5.30am on Monday 21 December firefighters were informed of a wheelie bin on fire inside a communal area of a block of flats on Redshank Lane in Birchwood.

It is believed that the fire was started deliberately.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone with any information which could aid their investigation to get in touch.

Detective Constable Cath Hudson said: "I would like to reassure the community that this is believed to be an isolated incident.

"This act endangered the lives of residents but thankfully, due to the swift action of Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service, they were evacuated to safety and the fire quickly extinguished.

"It would appear that the bin had been taken into the communal area from the street outside and we believe that this may have been seen or heard by local residents at the time.

"I would ask anyone who may know those who are responsible or may have seen anything to get in touch.

"The same goes to anyone in the Redshank Lane area around the time of the incident who may have caught CCTV or dashcam footage of the offenders."

Anyone with any information or footage that may be able to help with the investigation is asked to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101 quoting IML 878648 or give the information via the Cheshire Police website.

Information can also be passed on to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or report it via the Crimestoppers website.
