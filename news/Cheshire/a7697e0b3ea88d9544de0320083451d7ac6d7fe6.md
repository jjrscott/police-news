Detectives from Macclesfield CID are appealing for information after thieves targeted a cash machine in Bollington.

At around 4am on Monday 9 December police received multiple reports of a loud bang outside the Co-operative store on Wellington Road.

Officers attended and found that the ATM outside the store had been forced open and a quantity of cash had been stolen.

Two men, who were both wearing hoods and face coverings, were seen fleeing the scene following the incident. They ran across Wellington Road and down a track which leads onto Middlewood Way.

One of the men was wearing shorts.

Detective Sergeant Keith Graham, of Macclesfield CID said: "Our investigation into this incident is in its very early stages and we are currently trying to establish exactly how the offenders accessed the machine.

"Enquiries into the incident are ongoing and as part of this we want to hear from anyone with any information which may aid our investigation.

"The same goes for anyone who believes that they may know who the offenders are, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of them arriving at or fleeing the scene."

Anyone with information that may be relevant to the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 584157, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Dashcam footage can be submitted online via the Cheshire Constabulary website.
