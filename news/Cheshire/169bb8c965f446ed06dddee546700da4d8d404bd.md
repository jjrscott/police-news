Detectives investigating a firearms discharge in Warrington are urging people to come forward with information.

At 8.50pm on Friday 24 April a number of shots were fired outside an address on Poplars Avenue.

Officers from the Local Policing Unit - supported by armed officers - attended to the scene.

A 55-year-old man received serious, but not life threatening, injuries to his leg and was taken to Warrington Hospital by ambulance.

He remains in hospital in a stable condition.

The investigation is in its early stages and enquiries to establish the circumstances of the incident are ongoing.

A policing presence remains in the area to provide reassurance to the local community.

At this stage no arrests have been made.

Detective Inspector Sarah Oliver said: "I understand how concerning this incident will be for those living in the area and I want to reassure residents that they can expect to see a visible policing presence while we do everything we can to trace those responsible.

"The investigation is in its early stages and I need the help and support of the local community to provide any information they may have - even the smallest piece can be useful.

"I know some people may feel uncomfortable contacting the police, therefore I would urge you to contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
