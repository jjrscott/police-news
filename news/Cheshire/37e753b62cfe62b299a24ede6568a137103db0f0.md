Police in Ellesmere Port are cracking down on anti-social behaviour in Whitby Park.

A small number of young people are causing trouble to the detriment of legitimate users of the park.

Acting Chief Inspector Ian Stead said: "We want everyone to enjoy Whitby Park, but just a small minority of children are ruining it for the majority by causing trouble and setting fire to bins.

"I'd like to take the opportunity to remind parents that it's important that you know where your children are, especially due to the Covid restrictions.

"We will be stepping up patrols in the area over the weekend. So be warned, if your son or daughter is one of the small minority of children committing anti-social behaviour, you could find us on your doorstep returning your child home, and you could be facing a Covid fine if your child is under 18 - which could make this an expensive weekend for you.

"So the message is enjoy the park and what it has to offer, but respect other users and behave responsibly.

"If you're in the park and see anti-social behaviour, tell us about it by calling us on 101 as its happening so that we can respond appropriately. By working together we can reduce anti-social behaviour and make our open spaces enjoyable and safe for everyone."
