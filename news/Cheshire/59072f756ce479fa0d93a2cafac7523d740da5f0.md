**Detectives are appealing for information and footage from members of the public following an incident in Widnes.**

At around 5.20am on Sunday 9 February three males knocked on the front door of a house in Cameron Road and shouted 'it's Cheshire Police'.

When the front door was opened they attempted to barge their way inside the property.

Seeing they were not police offices, and that they were armed with a knife and a metal bar, the occupants managed to push the males back and close the front door.

The males then fled on foot.

Two of them were wearing high-visibility clothing and the other was wearing dark clothing.

At least two of them had balaclavas on.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are appealing for anyone who believes they saw the males, either before they knocked on the front door or as they were fleeing the scene, to come forward.

They also want to speak to anyone who thinks they may know who the males are, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of them.

Detective Sergeant Roberts, of Widnes Local Policing Unit, said: "I would like to reassure residents that this is believed to be an isolated incident and we are determined to establish the identities of the males and what they were doing at the address.

"Enquiries are ongoing and I urge anyone who was in the area and saw anything suspicious to get in touch with us here at Widnes Police Station.

"We also want to speak to anyone who believes they may know who the males are, or have footage of them."

Anyone with information or CCTV or dashcam footage that may be relevant to the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 632558, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
