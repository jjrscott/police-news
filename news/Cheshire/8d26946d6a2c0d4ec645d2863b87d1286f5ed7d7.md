**Police investigating a spate of criminal damage to windows in Warrington are appealing for information.**

Between 12pm and 4pm on Tuesday 23 March offenders drove around Poplars and Hulme and Padgate firing ball bearings from a catapult at cars and windows.

An 11-year-old boy and a 42-year-old man were also hit and received minor injuries.

Following a number of enquiries police quickly located and stopped a white van in Newton-le-Willows and arrested two men, aged 22 and 32, on suspicion of assault and criminal damage.

They were taken into custody to be questioned and have since been released under investigation while enquires continue.

Sergeant Lee Hillyard, from Warrington Local Policing Unit, said: "Understandably this has been an alarming and quite frightening incident for the local community and the public can expect to see officers out on patrol in order to provide reassurance.

"I want to reassure the public that we quickly located and arrested two men and are continuing to work incredibly hard to gather evidence as part of this ongoing investigation.

"As part of our enquiries I am appealing to anyone who has CCTV or dash cam footage which could assist us to please get in touch.

"At this stage we have received 19 reports of criminal damage and two reports of people sustaining injuries however we believe there could be more victims and encouraging people to come forward.

"If you can assist or have any further information please call Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 945517."
