Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a large quantity of cigarettes were stolen during a burglary at a convenience store in Northwich.

At around 1.30am on Monday 24 August three unknown men broke into the Co-op store on Cheshire Business Park, Lostock Gralam.

Once inside the building the offenders, who were wearing dark clothing, stole cigarettes.

They fled the scene in a black Audi at around 1.40am, travelling towards Manchester on the A556.

Officers believe that the incident may be linked to an attempted burglary which occurred at a store in Holmes Chapel a short time before the incident in Northwich.

Detective Constable Matthew Uren, of Northwich CID, said: "The investigation is currently in its early stages and we are following a number of lines of enquiry, including CCTV and forensics.

"As part of the enquiries I want to hear from anyone who was in the area between 1.15am and 1.45am and witnessed anything suspicious.

"The same goes for any motorists who were driving in the area around the time of the incident and believes they may have captured the offenders on their dashcams.

"I urge anyone with any information, no matter how small, to call the team here at Northwich on 101, quoting IML 788053."

Anyone with information or dashcam footage that may aid the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 788053 or visit https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about.

Information can also be reported anonymously, via Crimestoppers, on 0800 555 111.
