Police investigating a suspicious incident in Alsager are looking into a second similar report.

At around 4.30pm on 21 February a 19-year-old woman was walking along Ashmores Lane when she was approached by a man who attempted to befriend her. The woman walked off in the opposite direction.

He was described as being around 5ft 8ins tall with short brown hair, glasses and approximately 30 years old.

PC Kerrie Cummings said: "We're continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding the man's odd behaviour and have had a number similar reports of a man with a similar description trying to speak to women and teenagers in the area of Audley Lane and nearby.

"I'd appeal to anyone who sees the man or knows who this man may be to contact us as he is causing some concern in the community with his behaviour."

Anyone with information should contact Cheshire Police on 101 or via www.cheshire.police.uk quoting IML 918405. Alternatively information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
