Detectives investigating an improvised device at an address in Warrington are appealing for information.

The device was in the front garden of an address on Birtles Road in Orford on the afternoon of Wednesday 15 April.

The EOD (Explosive Ordinance Disposal) team attended to the scene and following an assessment they carried out a controlled detonation.

Since then an investigation has been ongoing to establish the circumstances and officers will be conducting house-to-house enquiries this weekend.

Detective Inspector Julie Jackson, from Warrington Local Policing Unit, said: "Since the improvised device was located we have been following a number of enquiries.

"The device was a targeted attack and we believe it to be connected to serious and organised crime.

"I am appealing to those who may have information surrounding the device and how it came to be placed in the garden to come forward.

"If you do not feel comfortable speaking to police directly, I would encourage you to contact Crimestoppers anonymously.

"To those who live in the area, if you have any information please get in touch."
