Detectives have launched an appeal after a car windscreen was damaged in Ellesmere Port.

Sometime between 12am and 12.45am on Thursday 16 April, unknown offenders are believed to have smashed the windscreen of a BMW, owned by an NHS worker, on Enfield Road in Ellesmere Port.

Officers are now appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

Detective Constable Tom Davies, of Ellesmere Port and Neston Local Policing Unit, said: "This mindless act of vandalism has left a NHS worker unable to get to work at this unprecedented time.

"We will be stepping up patrols in the local area and I am urging anyone who may have CCTV footage of the incident to get in touch.

"Alternatively, anyone with information on who may have committed this senseless act is asked to come forward."

Anyone with CCTV footage or information is asked to get in touch with Cheshire Constabulary by calling 101 quoting IML 683607 or report it via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report/
