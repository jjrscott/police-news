**A drug dealer from Chester who had up to £7,000 of cocaine in his possession has been jailed.**

Following information from the public, police raided an address on Westminster Road in Hoole on Friday 15 June 2018 and seized cocaine, with a purity of 76 per cent, and arrested Jack Marsland.

The cocaine recovered is likely to have led to more than 150 drug deals and is valued between £6,040 and £7,550 with a wholesale value of £2000 to £3000\.

The 21-year-old was subsequently charged and sentenced to five years and 10 months in prison after being found guilty of possession with intent to supply cocaine following a trial at Chester Crown Court on Thursday 5 December 2019.

Marsland, of Chester, was also sentenced for admitting to being concerned in the supply of cannabis. This is following a search at a different property on Westminster Road in Hoole on 8 November 2017 where drugs were seized.

PC Ross Peel, of Chester Local Policing Unit, said: "Marsland is without doubt a prolific drug dealer intent on supplying both cocaine and cannabis to make a profit and has no consideration for how his activity impacts on the local community.

"While we will continue to relentlessly pursue individuals like Marsland, information from the public is paramount when disrupting drug activity and making the area you live in, a safer place.

"I want to take this opportunity to encourage you to spot signs of drug dealing and to come forward to report it."
