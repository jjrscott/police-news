Detectives have renewed their appeal for information on the anniversary of the death of a Widnes woman.

Mother-of-two Veronica Anderson left her home in Widnes at 10.10pm on Saturday 24 August 1991 after receiving a phone call.

Just hours later (shortly after 3am on Sunday 25th August 1991) the 42-year-old was found dead in her car off Tannery Lane in Penketh, Warrington.

A murder investigation was subsequently launched by Cheshire Constabulary.

Despite extensive and exhaustive enquiries over the years, no-one has ever been convicted in connection with her death.

On the anniversary of Vera's death, officers are appealing for anyone who has any information about the case, to come forward.

Detective Inspector Adam Waller said: "Vera's family were left heartbroken by her death and have had to live with what happened over the past 29 years.

"Someone out there must know something about what happened that day. I appreciate that it is a long time ago but I am sure that if you witnessed something you would still remember this now.

"Anyone with any information is urged to come forward - even the smallest detail can be crucial."

Anyone with any information is urged to contact Cheshire Constabulary on 101 quoting occurrence number 0709373610.

If you do not want to speak to the police then information can also be passed on anonymously, via Crimestoppers, on 0800 555 111.
