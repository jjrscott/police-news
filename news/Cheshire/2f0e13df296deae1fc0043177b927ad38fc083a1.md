**Detectives investigating a serious assault in Alsager are appealing for information from members of the public.**

The incident occurred in an alleyway between Blenheim Court and Winston Avenue on Saturday 31 October.

The victim, a 49-year-old man from Alsager, was assaulted by a small group of young men.

He sustained serious facial injuries as a result of the incident, which occurred between 9.45pm and 11pm.

The victim received hospital treatment for his injuries and has since been discharged.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone with any information or footage that may help their investigation to come forward.

Detective Constable Sarah Sayer, who is leading the investigation, said: "This was a serious assault that left the victim in hospital with significant facial injuries.

"He does not know the young men he encountered as he walked through the alleyway that night.

"I would like to reassure members of the community that we are determined to establish who assaulted the victim and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"Enquiries are ongoing and I urge anyone who was in the area and saw anything that may aid our investigation to get in touch.

"Perhaps you saw the small group of young men before or after the incident took place, or maybe you think you know who they are or have CCTV or dashcam footage of them."

Anyone with information or footage that may be relevant to the ongoing investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 841355, give the details via Report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
