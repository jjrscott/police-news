Officers have released a CCTV still of a man they would like to speak to following the theft of a bank card in Warrington.

At around 10.40am on Friday 7 February the victim paid for items at a supermarket on Church Street before travelling home.

Once at home the victim realised that his wallet was missing.

Several transactions were then made on the card a short time later including the withdrawal of Â£300\.

Officers have now issued a CCTV still image of a man that they believe may have vital information which could help them with their investigation.

Constable Paula Goodwin of Warrington Local Policing Unit said: "This is a particularly abhorrent crime whereby the elderly victim has not only had his wallet stolen but money taken from his bank account.

"We have been following a number of lines of enquiry and are keen to speak to anyone who may be able to help us trace the man pictured in the CCTV image.

"I would urge anyone who may recognise the man or the man himself to come forward to police."

Anyone with information that can help identify the male in the CCTV image is asked to call Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 631740 or report it via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report/

Alternatively, anyone with information is asked to call independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or report it via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
