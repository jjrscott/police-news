Police are appealing for information from the public after burglars targeted a home which had been evacuated due to flooding in Warrington.

Sometime between 5pm on Sunday 24 January and 10am on Monday 25 January someone forced entry into a house on Rostherne Close in Sankey.

Once inside they searched the address and stole a number of items.

PC Rebecca Jubb, from Warrington Local Policing Unit said: "To target a house which has been evacuated due to flooding is simply despicable and we are committed to doing all we can to identify the people responsible.

"The victims in this case have enough on to deal with following the flooding of their home and the last thing they needed was to be burgled.

"Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and we are following a number of lines of investigation, including CCTV footage and forensics.

"While we have already recovered some CCTV footage, we are keen to hear from anyone else in the area with any CCTV or dashcam footage which may aid our investigation.

"The same goes for anyone who thinks they may have witnessed the incident, or believes they have information which may aid our enquiries."

Chief Inspector Neil Drum, Head of Warrington Local Policing Unit, added: "Over the past few days I've seen myself how the local community have really come together to support each other following the flooding and I understand the concern that this incident is likely to cause.

"I would like to reassure residents that we are doing all we can to ensure those responsible for this incident are held accountable for their actions.

"We have also increased patrols across the affected areas and I would urge anyone with any concerns to speak to an officer."

Anyone with any relevant information or footage is asked to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting incident number IML 902910, or give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report.

Information can also be reported anonymously, via Crimestoppers, on 0800 555 111.
