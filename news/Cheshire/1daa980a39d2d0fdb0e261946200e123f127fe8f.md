**Officers investigating an indecent exposure are appealing for information from members of the public.**

A man exposed himself to two 14-year-old girls as they were walking by the junction of Plough Lane and Brown Heath Road in Christleton, near Chester.

The offender then walked off in the direction that he came from, along Plough Lane towards The Plough Inn.

The incident happened at around 8.30am on Monday 25 November.

The offender is described as white, around 30 to 40 years old and approximately 5' 11" tall. He had dark hair and a beard and was wearing dark clothing.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and officers are urging anyone who was in the area and believes they saw the offender, or may know who he is, to come forward.

Sergeant Andy Collinson, of Chester Local Policing Unit, said: "I would like to reassure members of the community that this appears to have been an isolated incident - we have not received any reports of similar offences in or around the Christleton area.

"I would also like to reassure them that we have stepped up patrols in the area as a precaution and we are doing everything we can to identify the offender and make him face the consequences of his actions.

"Enquiries are ongoing and as part of our investigation we are appealing for anyone who was in the area and believes they may have seen the offender to get in touch.

"The same goes for anyone who thinks they may know who the offender is, or have dashcam or CCTV footage of him."

Anyone with information or footage that may help officers with their investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 574198, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
