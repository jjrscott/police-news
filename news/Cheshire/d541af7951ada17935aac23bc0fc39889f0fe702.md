Police appeal after indecent exposures on Church Lawton canal towpath

Police are appealing for information following reports of indecent exposure on a canal towpath in Church Lawton.

At around 6.30pm on Monday 3 August a woman was jogging along the Trent and Mersey canal when the man who had been cycling along the towpath stopped and exposed himself. Another woman on a canal boat had also spotted the man's behaviour and warned two women walking along the canal. They reported seeing him behind a wall removing his trousers.

During the incidents the suspect had cycled toward Church Lawton and then back toward Kidsgrove.

The man is described as white, in his 50s or 60s, of medium build with grey hair.

He was wearing a black face mask, black beanie. A blue long sleeved top, or sweatshirt, black trousers and black boots.

Inspector Kelly Johnston said: "If you recognise the description or have seen this man yourself while on the canal towpath I would urge you to contact police.

"I would advise people who are out and about to be vigilant and report suspicious activity to police."

Anyone with information should contact Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 770958. Alternatively information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
