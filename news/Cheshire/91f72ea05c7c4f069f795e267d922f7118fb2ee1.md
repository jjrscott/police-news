Detectives from Northwich are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a serious assault in the town centre.

At around 3.20am on Saturday 7 March a 31-year-old local man became involved in an altercation with an unknown man outside the Quayside, on Witton Street.

The offender attacked the victim with a metal grid causing serious injuries to his face.

The victim, who is from the Lostock Gralam area, was subsequently taken to Leighton Hospital where he is recovering.

Enquiries into the incident are ongoing and officers are keen to hear from anyone with any information which may aid the investigation.

Detective Constable John Corrigan of Northwich CID said: "The victim in this attack sustained serious injuries and we are committed to doing all that we can to trace the person responsible.

"The incident occurred outside a number of busy pubs and I would ask anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed what took place to get in touch.

 "I'd also like to hear from any taxi drivers, or other motorists, who were driving on Witton Street at the time of the incident and thinks they may have dashcam footage which may be relevant to the investigation."

Anyone with information or footage that may aid the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101 quoting IML 654843.

Information can also be reported online at https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or via Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
