Detectives investigating the murder of a man in Warrington have issued a fresh appeal for information on the six month anniversary of his death.

Mark Bradbury, 58, died after suffering significant head injuries at his home on Station Road South.

He was found on Sunday 4 August but was last seen alive at 5pm on Thursday 1 August near his home.

A murder investigation has been ongoing for the past six months and in that time a team of detectives have been following a number of lines of enquiry.

Police hope the anniversary appeal will help to prompt a memory or encourage someone who may have previously been reluctant to speak to the police, to come forward.

In particular, officers are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen, bought or been offered Mark's Citizen Eco-Drive watch, which has been missing since his death.

Detective Inspector Sarah Oliver, who is leading the investigation, said: "Our thoughts remain with Mark's family and friends as we mark the six month anniversary of his death.

"This is very much an active and ongoing investigation and we remain determined and committed to establishing who killed Mark and making them face the consequences of their actions.

"We have followed numerous lines of enquiry during the course of the investigation, however we are still appealing for information from the public. Even the smallest detail could be vital in helping us bring this tragic case to a conclusion.

"I am still keen to find out what happened to the watch Mark was regularly seen wearing - this has not been seen since he died. I believe somebody out there knows where it is.

Perhaps it has been disposed of or been sold to you - if you have seen the watch or believe you know where it is, I want to hear from you."

A 39-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder remains on conditional bail.
