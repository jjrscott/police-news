**Detectives have released CCTV images of two men they want to speak to in connection with a burglary in Runcorn.**

The incident occurred between 5pm and 6pm on Wednesday 24 February.

It saw a quantity of jewellery stolen from a house in Lodge Lane, Halton Village, after the property had been broken into when no-one was at home.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives believe that the men in the CCTV images may have vital information to aid their investigation.

They are urging anyone who recognises them or thinks they may know who the men are to get in touch.

Detective Constable Daryl Gavin, of Runcorn Local Policing Unit, said: "Burglary is a serious offence in which victims are targeted in their own home, which is the place they should be able to feel most safe.

"We are determined to establish who carried out the burglary in the Halton Village area of Runcorn and bring them to justice.

"We believe that tracing and speaking to the men in the CCTV images will help us to achieve those goals.

"If you think you recognise them, please let us know.

"I would also like to appeal directly to the men in the CCTV images to get in touch."

Anyone with information that may help the investigation is asked to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 924890, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
