Detectives investigating an attempted robbery in Ellesmere Port are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

Shortly after midnight on Friday 29 November a 21-year-old man was walking along Pooltown Road when he was approached by two men.

One of the men restrained him while the other punched him causing an injury to his eye and searched his pockets.

Detective Constable Joe Duckworth, of Ellesmere Port Local Policing Unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who may have been in the area at the time, in particular the driver of a vehicle who drove past while the assault took place, to come forward.

"Anyone who has information can contact Cheshire Police on 101 quoting 19100698131 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
