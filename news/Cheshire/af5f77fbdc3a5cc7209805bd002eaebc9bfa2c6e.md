Two people wearing caps and face coverings broke into the KFC restaurant on Hospital Way near The Shopping City at around 1.45am on Monday 12 October.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone with any information or footage that may help their investigation to get in touch.

"Our investigation is currently in its early stages and we are following a number of lines of enquiry, including CCTV and forensics.

"As part of our enquiries we want to speak to anyone who was in the area in the early hours of Monday 12 October and witnessed anything suspicious.

"The same goes for any motorists who were driving in the area around the time of the incident and believes they may have captured the offenders on their dashcams.

"We also want to hear from anyone who believes they may know who the offenders are.

"I urge anyone with any information, no matter how small, to contact the team here at Runcorn Police Station."

Anyone with information or dashcam footage that may aid the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 825830, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
