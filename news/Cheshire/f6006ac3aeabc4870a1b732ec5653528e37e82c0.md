**Officers are appealing for information from members of the public regarding two cars being overturned in Warrington.**

The incidents in the Chapelford area of Great Sankey were reported to the police shortly after 7.30pm on Friday 30 October.

Officers swiftly attended and discovered that a small white car had been overturned in Minnesota Drive and a Ford Fiesta had been overturned in Jamestown Avenue.

There were no signs of those involved in the incidents.

Officers imposed a dispersal order to prevent further incidents from occurring and enquiries in relation to the damaged cars have been ongoing ever since.

Sergeant Upile Mtitimila, of Warrington Local Policing Unit, said: "Anyone would be angry and upset to discover that their parked car had been overturned in the street.

"Such criminal damage incidents are completely unacceptable and we are determined to discover who overturned the cars and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"Enquiries in relation to the incidents are continuing and I urge anyone with any information or footage that may aid our endeavours to establish who overturned the cars to come forward."

Information can be given directly to Cheshire Constabulary by calling 101, quoting IML 840131, or via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report.

Anyone who is not comfortable with communicating with the police can give information to independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
