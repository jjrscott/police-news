**Detectives are appealing for information from members of the public following a knifepoint robbery in Runcorn.**

The incident occurred at a vehicle repair centre in Percival Lane on Tuesday 9 February.

Two males entered the garage at around 3.45pm. One of them was armed with a knife. He threatened an employee with it whilst the other offender wheeled an off-road motorbike out of the premises.

The two offenders then fled on the blue Yamaha YZF450 together, riding across the Mersey Gateway to Widnes.

They were both white and were dressed all in black.

The man who threatened the garage worker with a knife was around 5' 11" tall, looked to be around 20 years old and spoke with a Liverpudlian accent.

He was wearing tech walking trousers, a black hooded jacket with the hood up and also had a ski mask over his head.

The other offender was slimmer, slightly shorter and looked to be younger.

He was also wearing a hooded jacket with the hood up and a face covering.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone with any information or footage regarding the robbery, the offenders or the whereabouts of the stolen off-road motorbike to get in touch.

Detective Constable Nathaniel Walkowiak, of Runcorn CID, said: "The garage worker sustained a minor injury as a result of the incident and has understandably been left extremely shaken up by what happened.

"I would like to reassure members of the Runcorn community that this is believed to be an isolated incident and a targeted attack and we are determined to establish who committed the robbery, bring them to justice and have the stolen scrambler bike returned to its rightful owner.

"Enquiries are ongoing and I urge anyone who was in Percival Lane in the Weston Point area of Runcorn and saw anything that may help our investigation to contact us at Runcorn Police Station.

"The same goes for anyone who thinks they may know who the offenders are, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of them.

"We also want to speak to anyone who believes they may have seen the stolen scrambler bike since the robbery took place, or have information regarding its whereabouts."

Anyone with information or footage that may aid the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 914082, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
