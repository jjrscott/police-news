**Cheshire Police has arrested 230 people for drink/drug driving as part of a month-long crackdown during the Christmas period, which is more than seven people a day.**

The operation, which ran from 1 December - 1 January, saw officers out on the county's roads targeting those motorists who chose to get behind the wheel after having an alcoholic drink or taking drugs, and in the mornings when they could have still been over the limit.

Superintendent Jo Marshall-Bell, who heads up Cheshire Police's Roads and Crime Unit, said: "For motorists to get behind the wheel after having an alcoholic drink or taking drugs, even though they know the risks could be fatal, baffles me.

"We do not go out policing the roads for the sake of it - we are doing it to save lives. If you are willing to put yours or innocent road users lives at risk then we will take action, and 230 people in Cheshire will face the consequences of their reckless and selfish actions.

"People are often quick to assume it is just young drivers who drive after having a drink, but the data tells us that the most common age range for those arrested for drink driving is 35-39, showing that people of all ages are choosing to drive under the influence of alcohol.

"Making Cheshire's roads as safe as possible is of upmost importance to me and my team and rest assured, we will continue to target those road users intent on committing one of the Fatal 5 offences: careless driving, speeding, drink/drug driving, using a mobile phone while driving and not wearing a seatbelt."
