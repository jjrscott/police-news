Police are appealing for witnesses and CCTV footage after a woman was assaulted outside her home in Widnes.

At around 8.30pm on Wednesday 17 March the 37-year-old heard a knock on her door in Downside.

Upon answering it the woman was threatened by an unknown man.

He then slashed her across the face with a knife before fleeing the area on foot.

The man is described as young, white and around 6' tall. He had an athletic build, was clean shaven and had fair hair and blue eyes.

The offender was wearing a long-sleeved top and navy blue trainers.

The victim sustained a serous facial injury as a result of the incident that required surgery.

She is currently recovering in hospital.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone who may be able to aid their investigation to come forward.

Detective Sergeant Roberts, of Widnes Local Policing Unit, said: "The victim sustained a serious facial injury as a result of the attack and we are committed to doing all we can to trace the man responsible.

"We are keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed anything that may be relevant to our investigation.
