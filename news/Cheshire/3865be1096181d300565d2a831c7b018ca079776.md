A Merseyside criminal who left a man with lifelong injuries after robbing him at his home in Ellesmere Port has been jailed for 12 years.

Wesley Sherlock, of St Marys Street in Wallasey, hit the 23-year-old man in the face with a gin glass.

On Thursday 1 December the 27-year-old had forced his way into the victim's house on Victoria Road while shouting 'police'.

The victim was grabbed by the coat and told to lie on his stomach and put his hands behind his back.

While he lay on the floor, his watch was stolen from his wrist and he could hear rooms in his house being searched.

As he lay on the floor he was bleeding heavily from his face but unable to move.

Sherlock stole a games console, a designer handbag and a watch before escaping in a black BMW car parked nearby.

The victim was taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital by ambulance and police were called.

On 20 December a warrant was executed at Sherlock's address in Wallasey and he was arrested.

Detective Constable Chris O'Connor, from Ellesmere Port Policing Unit, said: "Sherlock is a vicious and nasty individual as well as prolific in his offending.

"This attack saw a young man left with significant facial injuries which will forever remind him of what took place in his own home.

"I can only hope the sentence handed to Sherlock is a form of closure to the victim and helps him to move forward."

Sherlock was sentenced at Chester Crown Court on Thursday 20 February.
