**Police searching for a missing woman from Macclesfield have discovered a body.**

The body was found in the River Bollin in Prestbury on Sunday 23 February.

Formal identification has not yet taken place. However, it is believed to be that of Angela Adams, who was reported missing earlier in the day.

The family of the 56-year-old have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers.

The death is not being treated as suspicious and a case file will be prepared for the coroner.

Officers would like to thank members of the public for their support during the search for Angela and request that her family's privacy be respected this difficult time.
