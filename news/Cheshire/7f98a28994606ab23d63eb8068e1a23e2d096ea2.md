**A man has been charged with murder following the death of a man in Macclesfield.**

Andrew Anderson, also known as Andrew Aisu, of Stirling Close, has been remanded into custody and is due to appear at Chester Magistrates' Court on Saturday 26 September.

At 2am on Wednesday 23 September officers attended an address on Stirling Close following reports of a man with serious injuries.

The victim - Peter Kirkham, aged 45, from Macclesfield - died a short time later at the scene despite the best efforts of paramedics.

Peter's family have been informed and formal identification has taken place. They are currently being supported by specialist officers.

Aisu, aged 35, was arrested on Wednesday 23 September and subsequently charged on the afternoon of Friday 25 September.

Peter's brother Paul has paid tribute to him.

He said: "Peter was a loving son, brother and father.

"He was a nice and mischievous man with a kind heart and would take anybody into his home.

"He looked out for me and was very caring. We will miss him very much."
