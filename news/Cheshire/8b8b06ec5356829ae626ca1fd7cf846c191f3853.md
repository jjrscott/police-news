**Detectives investigating a robbery in Widnes are appealing for witnesses to come forward.**

At around 5.50pm on Tuesday 29 December an 18-year-old man was walking along Lugsdale Road near to Lacey Court when he was attacked by three men.

The men grabbed him and he was hit numerous times with a hammer.

The men then stole his watch and the jewellery he was wearing and made off on Lugsdale Road in the direction of Tesco.

The man armed with the hammer is described as being aged in his 30s and was wearing a blue and grey mountain bubble coat.

The other men were all wearing black with a black balaclava covering their faces.

The victim sustained facial and head injuries and he received treatment at hospital.

Detective Constable Kayleigh Brown, from Widnes CID, said: "This was an unprovoked and terrifying attack which left the young man with injuries to his head and face.

"We have been following a number of enquiries since it took place and believe a similar incident occurred the same day at around 5.10pm on Foxley Heath and Scott Avenue. It involved three men assaulting a man with a hammer and stealing his bike.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time and may have seen the assault take place, or have information of the men described, to come forward.

"I would also ask the public to check their CCTV or dash cam footage to see if it may assist with the investigation.

"Please get in touch by calling Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 884379 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
