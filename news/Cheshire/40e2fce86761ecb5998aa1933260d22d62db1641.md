**Cheshire Constabulary has been conducting a complex investigation into an allegation of misconduct and fraud relating to the awarding of a contract by Cheshire East Council to a fitness company.**

A file of evidence was submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service, who considered this in some detail and advised that although there were issues in relation to procurement, there was insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of a conviction against any individual.

The CPS advice concerns only the above fraud allegation. A further five allegations referred to police by Cheshire East Council remain under investigation.

Meanwhile, a separate investigation into misconduct relating to grant funding for a primary school car park has also concluded, with no further action to be taken.
