Detectives investigating an attempted armed robbery at a shop in Warrington have released CCTV images of a man they are looking to trace.

At around 9.20am on Tuesday 10 March a man carrying a knife entered a clothing store in Lovely Lane.

He threatened two store workers with the knife and demanded that they hand over cash from the till.

The store workers refused and the offender fled the store empty handed.

The offender was white, around 6' tall and had a very slim build.

He spoke with a local accent and was wearing a striped light grey hoody with the hood pulled up, black trousers, mirrored sunglasses and a black snood covering the bottom half of his face.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone who believes they may know the identity of the man in the CCTV images to get in touch.

Detective Constable Darren Gibson said: "While the offender fled empty handed, the victims in this case have understandably been left shaken up.

"We are doing all that we can to trace the man responsible and make him face the consequences of his actions.

"As part of our ongoing enquiries we are looking to trace the man in the CCTV images.

"If you think you recognise him from his build and the clothes he had on please contact the team here at Warrington.

"The same goes for motorists with dashcams who were driving along Lovely Lane between 9am and 10am on Tuesday 10 March."

Anyone with any information which may assist the investigation, no matter how small, is urged to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 657073, or give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report.

Alternatively, information can be reported to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously.
