A pub in Warrington has been raided by police as part of an investigation into serious and organised crime.

At 8.30pm on Friday 13 December officers targeted The Blackburn Arms on Orford Green to disrupt drug related activity believed to be taking place within the premises.

An extensive search of the pub, and a number of people inside at the time, was carried out by officers who seized a quantity of drugs.

The raid involved officers from Warrington Local Policing Unit with support from public order officers along with five police dogs.

Superintendent Martin Cleworth, of Warrington Local Policing Unit, said: "The action taken tonight is in direct response to issues raised by the community - and I want to reassure you that we've listened to your concerns about suspected drug use and drug dealing within this pub and we've acted on it.

"Tonight we've struck on those who are determined to deal drugs on our streets and in our neighbourhoods, and who cause misery to so many people who live and work in this community.

"Our commitment to the people of Warrington is that we will continue to act on the information you give us, and take action like we have here, in order to disrupt those suspected of being involved in serious and organised crime."

Officers will remain at the premises and in the local area while the operation continues. Anyone with any concerns is urged to speak to them.
