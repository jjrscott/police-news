Detectives investigating an armed robbery in Warrington have released CCTV images of two men they want to speak to in connection with the incident.

It occurred at a convenience store on Gorse Covert Road at around 8.21pm on Sunday 10 May.

Two men, believed to be armed with knives, entered the One Stop shop and stole a quantity of cash while staff were inside.

There were no reports of any staff members receiving any injuries.

The men then left the store on foot in an unknown direction.

Enquiries in relation to the robbery are ongoing and officers are appealing for anyone who knows the men or may have information to get in touch.

Detective Constable Joe Davies, of Warrington Local Policing Unit, said: "This was understandably a terrifying ordeal for the members of staff who were in the store at the time and have been left shaken.

"We are following a number of lines of enquiry and as part of our investigation we want to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the robbery or were in the area at the time.

"Although you can't see the face of the man in the CCTV image people may recognise him from his clothing. If you do or you have any further information please contact us."

If you have any information please contact Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 702176.
