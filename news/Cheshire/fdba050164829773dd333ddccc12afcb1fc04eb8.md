Detectives in Warrington are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an attempted robbery in Sankey Valley Park.

At around 5.50pm on Monday 24 February a 52-year-old man was walking along a footpath next to the St Helens Canal when he was verbally abused by two unknown teenage boys.

Upon challenging the boys, one of them produced a meat cleaver from down the front of his trousers and demanded that the victim handed over money and his mobile phone.
The victim refused and backed away, before taking his phone out to call 999.

At that point the offenders chased after the victim and threatened to attack him if he called the police.

The man then put the phone back into his pocket and the teenagers fled the scene in the direction of the footbridge over Sankey Way, near to the Peace Centre.

The boys were both white and looked to be aged between 14 and 16.

The teenager who was carrying the meat cleaver is described as approximately 5' 9" to 5' 10" tall with a proportionate build and straight, medium length, mousey hair.

He spoke with a Warrington accent and was wearing a green zipped-up jacket, black tracksuit bottoms or jeans and black trainers.

The other boy was around 5' 10" to 5' 11" tall with a slim build and blonde, medium length, straight hair. He was wearing a silver/grey matching tracksuit and trainers and was riding a black mountain bike.

Detective Constable Rob Thorpe, of Warrington CID, said: "Thankfully, the victim in this case was not injured. However, the ordeal has understandably left him shaken up.

"We are doing all that we can to trace the teenagers responsible so that they face the consequences of their actions.

"Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and as part of the investigation we are appealing for anyone who was in the area and believes they may have seen something suspicious to get in touch.

"The same goes for anyone who recognises the description of the offenders and believes they may know who the offenders are.

"I'd ask anyone with any information which may assist the investigation, no matter how small, to contact the team here at Warrington."

Anyone with any information which may assist the investigation, no matter how small, is urged to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 645483, or give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about .

Alternatively, information can be reported to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously .
