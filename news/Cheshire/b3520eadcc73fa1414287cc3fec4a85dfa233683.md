Police are appealing for information following a burglary in Huntington, Chester.

Sometime between 3pm and 6pm on Wednesday 2 December an address in Mercia Grove was burgled. Thieves left with a designer handbag but it appears nothing else was stolen.

Police are appealing for information or dashcam footage.

DS Andy Smith said: "I would urge anyone who has seen suspicious activity in the area recently or on the day of the burglary to contact us so that we can find those responsible.

"If you have any CCTV or dashcam, or if you remember seeing something that didn't quite seem right in the Mercia Grove area of Huntington, call us or go to our website."

Anyone with information should contact Cheshire Police on 101 or via www.cheshire.police.uk quoting IML 864680. Alternatively information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
