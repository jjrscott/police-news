**Police are appealing for information following criminal damage at a school in Knutsford.**

Sometime overnight on 31 July two teenagers caused a significant amount of damage to Knutsford Academy in Bexton Road.

Roof tiles were taken off the roof and thrown onto the floor and onto the green house smashing every pane of glass.

Windows of the school were also damaged along with the lightning conductor and aerials.

The first suspect is described as being, white, male and approximately 16-year-old. He is of slim build with brown hair and glasses. He was wearing a black hooded top black jogging bottoms and white trainers

The second suspect is described as white, male, of slim build and approximately 16-years-old. He was wearing a green or dark coloured jumper, a backpack and red jogging bottoms.

PC Luke Rose said: "The cost of the damage to the school is thought to be in its tens of thousands.

The damage caused was so extensive it is unbelievable to think someone would do this to an important part of our community.

We are carrying out a number of enquiries including reviewing CCTV.

Anyone who knows who is responsible or has information should do the right thing and contact police to help us find the people responsible."

Anyone with information should contact Cheshire Police on 101 or via our website quoting IML 770520.

Alternatively information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
