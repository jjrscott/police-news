**Join our emergency service teams next Tuesday, December 3, for a free Christmas Carol Concert at Chester Cathedral.**

Cheshire Constabulary, Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service and North West Ambulance Service will be providing an evening of traditional Christmas carols and Yuletide music, in the magical setting of the Cathedral on Abbey Square.

The evening promises something for all the family with renditions of festive favourites sung by the heavenly voices of Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service Choir, North West Ambulance Service Choir and children from Stapeley Broad Lane Primary School.

Cheshire Constabulary band will also be there playing brass and drums to entertain the audience.

The free to attend concert has an exciting programme with favourite carols mingled in with traditional readings, and lasts for approximately one hour.

Representatives from each of the emergency services will be there in uniform along with local dignitaries and anyone else who would like to attend the free evening.

The Cathedral doors open at 7pm for the concert, which starts at 7.30pm and everyone is welcome to attend.
