**Detectives investigating an arson incident in Widnes are appealing for witnesses to come forward.**

At around 12.20am today, Tuesday 26 November, a man walked up to a house in Blackburne Avenue and poured an unknown substance on the car parked on the driveway.

He then set the vehicle alight before running off in the direction he came from, towards the playing fields/car park area of Blackburne Avenue.

The offender is described as white and tall. He was wearing a grey hooded top with the hood up.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone with any information or footage that may aid their investigation to come forward.

Detective Sergeant Henderson Pierre, of Widnes Local Policing Unit, said: "Thankfully no-one was injured as a result of the fire, which was extinguished by firefighters.

"The vehicle was well alight when firefighters arrived at the scene and we are determined to establish who started the blaze and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"Enquiries are ongoing and as part of our investigation we want to hear from anyone who was in the area and witnessed anything that may be relevant.

"Perhaps you saw, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of, the offender before he started the fire or as he was fleeing the scene.

"Or maybe you have information regarding the identity of the offender.

"If you have any information that may be relevant to our investigation, no matter how small, please get in touch with the team here at Widnes Police Station."

Anyone with information or footage that may help detectives with their investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 573960, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
