Police in Widnes are appealing for witnesses following an indecent exposure.

At approximately 8.20am on Wednesday 18 December a 35-year-old woman was walking with her two young children down the path adjacent to Hough Green Railway Station toward the Arley Drive estate in Widnes when she was approached by a man who exposed himself.

The man didn't speak to them at any point and is described as being white in his 20's with mousey brown unkempt hair. He was wearing a grey hooded top and black slip on shoes and was riding a bicycle.

PC Gina Beardsmore said: "It is believed he was in company of a woman who is described as white and in her 40's. She was wearing a white hat and pink gloves, and also riding a bicycle.

"We would urge anyone who saw these two or has any information that my help us find the man responsible to contact us.

"People should be able to go about their business without having to feel threatened or concerned. That's why we are determined to catch this man and deter those who think this is acceptable behaviour - we will take action against you."

**Anyone with information should contact PC Gina Beardsmore on 101 or viahttps://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/ quoting police incident number IML 591433.**

**Alternatively information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.**
