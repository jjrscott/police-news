**Detectives are urging witnesses to come forward after a 49-year-old man sustained a facial injury during a robbery in Widnes.**

The incident occurred outside Upton Community Centre on Hough Green Road shortly after 11pm on Saturday 8 February.

The victim was sat in the driver's seat of his van when a man wearing a motorbike helmet opened his door and demanded cash.

Not realising that the offender was holding a machete, the victim got out of the van to confront him.

An altercation ensued, and after injuring the victim the offender stole a black sports bag from him.

He then jumped on the back of a moped being ridden by another man.

The pair subsequently rode off in the direction of Netherley Road.

As they did so, the victim, who is from the Merseyside area, drove himself to hospital.

He has subsequently been discharged after receiving treatment.

Detective Constable Tracey Short, of Widnes Local Policing Unit, said: "This was a terrifying incident that left the victim with a facial injury and extremely shaken up.

"I would like to reassure residents that this is believed to have been an isolated incident and we are doing everything we can to establish the identities of both the man who carried out the robbery and the getaway rider.

"The man who robbed and assaulted the victim was white and around 5' 10" tall with a proportionate built. He is estimated to be aged in his late teens or early 20s, had dark eyebrows and was wearing all black clothing, including the motorbike helmet.

"He had a snood on and his hood was up underneath the helmet.

"As part of our ongoing enquiries, we are appealing for anyone who believes they may know the identity of the man to get in touch with us at Widnes Police Station.

"We also want to speak to anyone who was in the area and witnessed, or has CCTV or dashcam footage of, anything that may help our investigation."

Anyone with information or footage that may aid the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 632425, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
