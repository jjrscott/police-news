A man who died in Macclesfield has been identified as 62-year-old Paul Cooke.

Mr Cooke died at Macclesfield Hospital following an assault at an address on Brocklehurst Way shortly before 9pm on Friday 20 December.

"I want to reassure the community that while we continue to establish what has happened, I believe it to be an isolated incident.
