**Officers are appealing for information from members of the public after a man indecently exposed himself at a bus stop in Runcorn.**

The incident occurred at The Park Bus Stop in Castlefields at around 8am on Friday 6 March.

It was witnessed by a 42-year-old woman from Runcorn.

After exposing himself, the offender walked off in the direction of Primrose Close and Limekiln Row.

He was white and looked to be between 30 and 40 years old.

The offender had dark brown hair and was wearing dark clothing, with a lot of layers.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and officers are urging anyone who was in the area and believes they saw the offender, or may know who he is, to come forward.

Sergeant Neil Anson, of Runcorn Local Policing Unit, said: "The offender did not talk to the woman or approach her, but it was still a frightening experience for her.

"I would like to reassure members of the community that we are doing everything we can to identify the offender and make him face the consequences of his actions.

"Enquiries are ongoing and as part of our investigation we are appealing for anyone who was in the area and believes they may have seen the offender to get in touch.

"The same goes for anyone who thinks they may know who the offender is, or have dashcam or CCTV footage of him."

Anyone with information or footage that may help officers with their investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 653988, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
