Detectives are appealing for dashcam footage after a man was knocked off his bike and threatened in Winsford.

At around 6.50pm on Friday 26 June a man was cycling along Hill Top Avenue when a blue BMW car knocked him off his pushbike.

A male passenger then got out of the car and threatened the victim with a machete.

The male offender returned to the car before it drove away towards the direction of Moss Bank.

Officers are now appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the incident or has dashcam footage of the BMW to get in touch.

Detective Constable John Corrigan of Northwich CID said: "Thankfully the victim involved in this case only sustained minor injuries as a result of being knocked off his bike and was able to flee the scene.

"We are currently investigating several lines of enquiry but are keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the incident and has not yet come forward.

"I would also urge anyone who may have caught dashcam or CCTV footage of the blue BMW around the time of the incident in the Moss Bank, Saxon Crossway or Delamere Street areas to contact us at Northwich CID.

"Anyone with information, no matter how big or small, is asked to call 101 quoting IML 740260 or report it to us online at https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report/."

Information can also be passed on to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
