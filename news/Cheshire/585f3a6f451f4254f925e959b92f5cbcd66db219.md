Christopher Guest More Jr, who was wanted in connection with the murder of a father at a farm in Cheshire almost 17 years ago, has now been extradited to the UK.

The 42-year-old, who was wanted on a European Arrest Warrant in connection with the death of Brian Waters, arrived back in the UK on Sunday 29 March.

Guest More Jr was arrested on 6 June 2019 in Malta following an extensive international appeal to locate him. This involved close working between Cheshire Constabulary and the National Crime Agency along with law enforcement agencies abroad.

He has since had several court appearances on the island as part of the extradition process and Cheshire Constabulary has liaised extensively with The Crown Prosecution Service, The Attorney General's Office, The State Advocate's Office in Malta, Malta Police Force and Malta's Correctional Services Agency throughout the process.

He has been remanded into custody and appeared before Warrington Magistrates' Court this morning (Monday 30 March) where he was further remanded into custody to appear at Chester Crown Court on Tuesday 31 March.
