Detectives are appealing for information from the public following a burglary at a house in Ashton Hayes.

The burglary occurred on Peel Hall Lane between 10.30am and 7.55pm on Monday 17 February.

A man knocked on the front door of the home and spoke to the occupant about fencing.

She then went into the back garden with the offender.

Meanwhile an unknown number of people went into the home and searched the bedroom.

They then leave the property. At this stage it is unclear whether anything has been stolen.

The man who spoke to the occupant is described as white, around 5ft 7 in height, aged in their mid-twenties or thirties, with a fair complexion and cropped light brown or sandy hair.

He was wearing blue canvas shoes with a large white rim around the bottom of the sole.

Detective Constable Peta Ticer, from Chester Local Policing Unit, said: "Being a victim of this crime can be deeply upsetting and traumatic.

"Those involved in the burglary took advantage of this lady in order to gain access to her home in an attempt to steal from her.

"Our enquiries are ongoing and I am urging anyone who was in the area at the time, who may have seen these men or spoken to them, to get in touch with us.

"Any information you have - no matter how small - could greatly assist our investigation."

If you have information please contact Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 639838.

Information can also be submitted through the police website https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ or anonymously by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or visiting their website crimestoppers-uk.org/
