Detectives investigating a burglary at a jewellers in Alsager have renewed their appeal for witnesses and video footage.

Sometime between 2pm and 7pm on Sunday 8 December an unknown man broke into Alexandra's Jewellers on Crewe Road.

The man gained access to the store after breaking into the rear entrance of a neighbouring property, which is accessed from the car park on Sandbach Road South.

Once inside the man entered the basement and tunnelled his way into the jewellers from where he stole a quantity of jewellery.

The offender then fled the scene sometime between 6pm and 7pm, running across Sandbach Road South carrying a green plastic bag for life.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and as part of their investigation officers have renewed their appeal for information.

Officers are keen to hear from anyone who visited the Sandbach Road South car park between 2pm and 7pm on Sunday 8 December and believes they may have witnessed anything suspicious.

Detective Constable, Amy Pegnam from Crewe CID, said: "This investigation is currently ongoing and we are committed to doing all that we can to trace the person responsible.

"As part of our investigation I want to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident and witnessed anything suspicious.

"I'm particularly like to hear from a man who was seen walking a medium size black dog into Milton Park between 6pm and 7pm.

"I also want to hear from anyone with a dashcam who was driving on Crewe Road or Sandbach Road South between 2pm and 7pm on Sunday 8 December and may have recorded the offenders travelling to, or fleeing, the store.

"The same goes for any residents with CCTV cameras who live in the area and believe they may have footage which may aid the investigation.

"I urge anyone with any information, no matter how small, to get in touch with the team here at Crewe CID on 101."

Anyone with information that may be relevant to the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 583937, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Dashcam footage can be submitted online via the Cheshire Constabulary website.
