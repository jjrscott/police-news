Police are appealing for witnesses following a serious collision in Crewe involving a pedestrian and a lorry.

At 1.52am on Tuesday 14 January police were called to a collision involving a HGV and a pedestrian on the Haslington Bypass near to Crewe Green roundabout.

A woman in her 30s was taken to Royal Stoke Hospital with serious injuries and remains in a critical condition.

Sgt Nick Rogers said: "I'm particularly keen to hear from anyone who saw a woman walking along Haslington bypass before the 1.50am that morning. If you have dashcam footage or saw a woman walking along the road in the early hours I would urge you to contact me."

Anyone with information or dashcam footage can contact Cheshire Police on 101 or via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/ quoting IML 611662.
