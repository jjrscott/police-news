**Detectives investigating a burglary in Neston are renewing their appeal to trace a man they want to speak to in connection with the incident.**

At around 6pm on Friday 17 January a man entered a property in The Parade, Parkgate, Neston, after climbing through a window.

The offender stole a quantity of cash and jewellery after conducting an untidy search of the address.

After being disturbed by the returning occupiers, he fled via the same window he got in through.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone who believes they may know the identity of the man in the CCTV footage to get in touch.

Detective Constable Jake Connolly said: "In this instance, the occupiers disturbed the burglar when they returned home but he still managed to steal a quantity of cash and jewellery.

"We would urge anyone with information that may help us identify the man to contact us.

"If you think you recognise him please call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 614522, give us the details via our website or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

"I would also like to appeal directly to the man in the CCTV footage to do the right thing and get in touch."
