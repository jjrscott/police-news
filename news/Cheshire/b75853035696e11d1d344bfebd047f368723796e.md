A quantity of drugs and a number of weapons have been seized in Warrington as police continue to disrupt serious and organised crime.

On the evening of Saturday 2 May a warrant was executed at an address on Hume Street.

Officers from Warrington's local policing unit - with support from the police dogs - recovered a quantity of drugs and weapons from the house.

A 30-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of producing a controlled drug and conspiracy to supply a controlled drug.

He has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

The warrant follows a number of recent incidents in Warrington that are believed to be linked to organised crime.

Police are continuing to act on information provided by the public to tackle the issue and protect the local community.

There is an increased policing presence in the town and local officers are carrying out high-visibility patrols in a number of areas to provide further reassurance to residents.

Superintendent Martin Cleworth, who is in charge of policing in Warrington, said: "I want you to know that I understand how concerning recent incidents have been for your community.

"Therefore I have increased our policing presence in the town and you can expect to see officers patrolling your streets to provide you with reassurance.

"I can assure you that we are still acting on information given to us and continuing to relentlessly pursue those who are believed to be involved with organised crime.

"You are our eyes and ears. I need the public to help and support my officers by coming forward with information as we continue to try and make the town safer."
