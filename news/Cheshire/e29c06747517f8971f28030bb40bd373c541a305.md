Cheshire Police is warning businesses which hold large amounts of fuel on site to be vigilant following two thefts in West and South Cheshire.

Two haulage yards had between 23,0000 and 45,0000 litres of fuel stolen overnight recently, the latest being reported to police on 29 October.

Detectives are now urging businesses such as haulage, transport, construction, and farming to be vigilant and keep an eye on fuel tanks as much as possible, checking for any tampering of the tanks and also perimeter fencing.

If you can, put CCTV and lighting in the yard as a deterrent.

DC James Elliott said: "While we investigate these thefts, we want to prevent any further crimes from taking place. If you notice any suspicious activity, or suspicious visitors to your yard, please contact police.

"Neighbours can also look out for each other by reporting any suspicious vehicles."

Anyone with information can contact Cheshire Police on 101 or via www.cheshire.police.uk

Alternatively information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
