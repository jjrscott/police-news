Police are appealing for witnesses following a robbery at a Hale News, High Street, Hale Village, Widnes.

At 6.45pm on Thursday 14 May two men entered the store and threatened a shop assistant with a firearm. They demanded money and fled with cash and cigarettes on a motorbike (pictured) along Hale Road toward Speke.

The first man is described as white and of stocky build. He possibly had blue eyes. He was wearing a black motorbike helmet, a black scarf that covered the lower part of his face and a black motorbike jacket with a belt. He was also wearing gloves and had a Liverpool accent.

The second man also had a Liverpool accent.

DS Henderson Pierre said: "The shop assistant was unharmed but she was shaken by her ordeal. Understandably this is concerning but we have stepped up patrols in the area and are making a number of enquiries including checking CCTV and making house to house enquiries.

"If you were driving through the village between 6.15pm and 7pm and you have dashcam footage which may help us with our enquiries we'd urge you to contact us so that we can find those responsible."

Anyone with information should contact Cheshire Police on 101 or via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/#sub-menu-2 quoting IML 704878.

Alternatively information can be passed anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers anonymously by on 0800 555 111.
