**Police investigating an assault in Warrington are appealing for information.**

At 8.45am on Wednesday 18 November a 51-year-old man and a car were at traffic lights on Station Road in Latchford.

The man was walking across the road when a dispute occurred with another man inside the car.

The car then pulled up a bit further up the road and two men got out.

One of the men allegedly pushed and punched the victim.

The attacker is described as being aged in his 50s, white with a stocky build. He was wearing a woolly hat with glasses.

The man who was with him is described as being of a thin build with dark hair and around 5'9" in height.

The victim's injuries were described as minor and he did not require hospital treatment.

Officers have been conducting a number of enquiries and are appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time or has any information to get in touch.

They are particularly keen to speak to a taxi driver who is believed to have seen the assault take place to come forward.

PC Angela Bahn, from Warrington's local policing unit, said: "Since the incident was reported to police we have been conducting a number of enquiries to establish what took place.

"Following this we are keen to speak to a taxi driver who is believed to have been in the area at the time the incident occurred. I am also appealing to the public or anyone else who was in the vicinity to come forward with any information they may have."

If you have information please contact Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 854168. Information can also be provided anonymously by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
