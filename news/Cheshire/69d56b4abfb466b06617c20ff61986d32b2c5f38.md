An 18-year-old Wilmslow man has been handed a Criminal Behaviour Order after harassing women in the town.

Jacob Lewis Reid, from Lacey Green, Wilmslow was given the order on 8 January following earlier convictions for a section 39 assault and two public order offences.

The Order will run for two years and if he breaches it, he faces the prospect of prison.

The Criminal Behaviour Order bars Reid from entering Wilmslow Town Centre or surrounding streets highlighted in the map.

PC Chris Mullin said: "Reid has been harassing women in the street and has been causing an unwarranted amount of anti-social behaviour in the town centre - causing misery to those who live and work there.

"We hope that Criminal Behaviour Order will curb his behaviour and reassure residents that we do take action. If you see Reid in the town centre or in the streets he is prohibited from entering, as shown on the map, contact police on 101.

"Together we can tackle anti-social behaviour and make our communities a safer place to live and work."
