A pensioner from Crewe who had her bicycle stolen while out shopping during the coronavirus pandemic has been given a new one.

The Halfords store in Grand Junction Retail Park in the town kindly offered to donate a new bike to the lady after hearing about the theft from local officers.

It occurred outside the Morrisons supermarket in Dunwoody Way, Crewe, on Tuesday 31 March between 1.10pm and 2.10pm.

The lady had locked the bike up outside the shop as she went into the store to buy food.

She was devastated when she discovered that the bike had been stolen and the incident was swiftly reported to the police.

Detective Inspector Claire Jesson, of Crewe Local Policing Unit, said: "Despicable crimes like this are so upsetting, particularly when they occur during these extremely difficult times and especially for our elder members of the community.

"The team and I at Crewe were heartbroken to hear of the elderly victim having her only means of transport stolen from her while she was out shopping.

"We wanted to surprise the lady with a replacement bike to put a smile on her face and enable her to still have transport to get around.

"I would like to say a massive thank you to Barry at Halfords for offering to come to the woman's aid after we told him about the callous crime.

"Kindness really does go a long way, especially during times like these when we as a community should be coming together to help and support each another, particularly the elderly and other vulnerable members of society."

A Halfords spokesperson said:

"We were delighted to help Crewe Police and the woman who had her bike stolen with a replacement. We hope she enjoys her new set of wheels."

Cheshire Constabulary's Chief Constable Darren Martland added:

"What a wonderful gesture by the team of officers and Halfords in coming together to help the lady, who I'm sure is extremely grateful."

The bicycle has since been located and returned to the lady today (Thursday 2 April) however enquiries in relation to the theft are ongoing.

Officers are appealing to the public to help identify a male they want to speak to in-connection with the theft.

He is described as wearing a black jacket with a hood, a black hat and a grey snood.

His trousers were dark coloured with a white stripe down the side which contained dark markings.
