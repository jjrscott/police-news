Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after offenders attempted to steal cash from an ATM machine in Weaverham.

At approximately 2.20am on Friday 10 January two unknown men wearing dark clothing were seen repeatedly ramming a JCB into cash machine outside Tesco Express on Northwich Road.

The pair failed to access the machine and subsequently set fire to the JCB before fleeing the scene empty handed in a white transit van heading towards Northwich.

Detective Sergeant John Lyons said: "Our investigation into this incident is in its very early stages and we are committed to doing all that we can to trace the people responsible.

"We are currently following a number of lines of enquiry and as part of this we want to hear from anyone who witnesses the incident or has any information which may aid our investigation.

"I'm also keen to hear from anyone who believes they may have seen the van fleeing the scene or possibly abandoned in the local area.

"The same goes for anyone who believes that they may know who the offenders are, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of them arriving at or leaving the scene."

Anyone with any information which could assist the investigation is asked to contact Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 608627, or online at https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/.

Information can also be passed anonymously, via Crimestoppers, on 0800 555 111.
