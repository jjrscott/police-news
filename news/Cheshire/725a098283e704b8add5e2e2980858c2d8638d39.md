**The family of a man who died following a serious assault in Warrington have paid tribute to him.**

Andrew Webster sadly died following the assault at Gateway Trade Park, Kerfoot Street, Warrington, which occured shortly after 10am on Thursday 2 July.

Andy's wife, Lisa, said: "Andy was such a strong, brave, wonderful husband, but more so he was a brilliant father. He made us feel safe and secure and built our family a great future.

"He worked hard as a builder, always perfecting every job he completed, he was never scared of a hard day's work and could always be found perfecting his garage or working on his next project.

"Andy was so well thought of in the town and so many called upon him for help and advice, whether that be personal or business.

"Ruby was the apple of his eye and Andy loved nothing more than spending quality time with her, whether that be on the back of one of his motorbikes, or on their annual Dad and daughter trips abroad.

"He loved his motorbikes, he had such a burning ambition to race, just recently he had put a small race team together and was excited for the first event.

"Words cannot describe how much we miss him and how much of a hero he is to us. Our time was cut short but we can still feel his love and loyalty and his many stories will be forever told by all who knew him."
