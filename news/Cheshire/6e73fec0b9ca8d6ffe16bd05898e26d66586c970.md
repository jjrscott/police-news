**Detectives are appealing for information following reports of a burglary at a property in Ellesmere Port.**

At sometime between 8.30pm to 9pm on Monday 22 February, unknown offenders gained entrance to an address on Hope Farm Road.

An untidy search was made and a quantity of jewellery was taken.

Officers are now asking anyone who has information to get in touch.

Detective Sergeant Graeme Carvell said: "Burglary is a particularly distressing crime where victims are targeted in their own home, a place where they should feel most safe.

"A number of enquiries are underway to find those responsible.

"As part of these enquiries, I would like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed anything suspicious in the area around the time of the incident to get in touch.

"The same goes for anyone who may have CCTV footage from around the Hope Farm Road area or dashcam footage from the scene around the time of the incident."

Anyone with information is urged to call Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 923536 or report it via the Cheshire Police website.

Information can also be provided to Crimestoppers anonymously via 0800 555 111 or via the Crimestoppers website.
