Police in Congleton are appealing for witnesses following a street robbery in the town.

Sometime between 2.20pm and 2.30pm on Sunday 22 December a 35-year-old man was walking along Borough Road when a silver Ford Fiesta drove past. He then heard a man speak to him from behind and turned round but then carried on walking towards Bromley Road.

As he noticed the silver Fiesta was stopped in the road he was suddenly dragged to the floor and saw the man who spoke to him now with another man. This man pointed a knife at him demanding his wallet. The two men then fled to the silver Fiesta and were driven off by a third man toward Brunswick Street.

DC Tom Binder said: "Thankfully the victim was unharmed but he was left shocked by his ordeal and cash and cards were stolen.

"We are doing everything we can to try and trace the suspects and have been making enquiries in the area. We also need your help. I would urge anyone with information to contact us, whether you witnessed the robbery or you were passing by and have dashcam footage - maybe you have information about those responsible. Please get in touch if you think you can help with our investigation."

Anyone with information or dashcam footage should contact DC Tom Binder on 101 quoting IML 595070 or via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/

Alternatively information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
