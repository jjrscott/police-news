**Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an assault in Winsford.**

At around 9pm on Thursday 1 October three men were attacked in an alleyway that runs between Delamere Street and Hilltop Avenue.

The men, aged 27, 39 and 45, then attended to a pub on Delamere Street with serious injuries believed to have been caused by a machete.

They were all taken to hospital by ambulance where they remain in a serious but stable condition.

Detectives have been conducting a number of enquiries and are urging anyone with information to come forward.

Detective Constable John Corrigan, from Northwich Local Policing Unit, said: "Since the attack took place we have been following a number of lines of enquiry to piece together the circumstances of the incident.

"At this stage we believe the attack took place in the alleyway with the men suffering slash wounds from a weapon similar to a machete.

"While we continue with the investigation, I am urging anyone who was either in this area, or the pub between 8.30pm and 9pm, and has information - no matter how small - to please come forward."

If you have information please contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 818070.
