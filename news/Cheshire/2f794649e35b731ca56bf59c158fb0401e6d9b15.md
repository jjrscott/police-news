Police are appealing for witness following a collision on the A534 Haslington bypass between Crewe and Sandbach.

It occurred at around 12.20am on Saturday 13 June, and involved a black Vauxhall Corsa which collided with a HGV parked in a lay-by at the Wheelock end of the bypass.

Sadly, one of the passengers, an 18-year-old local woman, was pronounced dead at the scene. Another 17-year-old woman has been taken to hospital with serious, but not life-changing, injuries, while a further passenger received minor injuries. The driver, a 17-year-old male, has been arrested in connection with the incident.

Officers are appealing for anyone who may have seen the collision, or anything unusual in the lead-up to it which may assist with their enquiries, to get in touch on 101 or through the Force website, quoting IML 728618.
