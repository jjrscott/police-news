Officer's investigating a fatal hit and run collision in Crewe have renewed their appeal for witnesses to come forward.

Agnieszka Pocztowska died on Monday 14 September following a collision on Hungerford Road.

The 41-year-old mother-of-three was cycling to work when she was knocked off her bike by a silver ford focus near to the junction of Hungerford Terrace at around 6.53am.

The driver of the car failed to stop and drove off from the scene.

The vehicle was later located in Lime Vale Street in the Trent Vale area of Stoke-on-Trent.

Sergeant Helen Cooper said: "Agnieszka was a devoted mother of three young children whose life was tragically cut short as a result of the callous actions of the people within this car.

"This wasn't a simple accident, the driver, and the passengers, were all aware of that they had hit Agnieszka but rather than stop and help, they purposefully chose to drive off and left her to die at the roadside.

"Not only that, but the dangerous driving continued and the car was involved in a second collision with another cyclist on Crewe Road. Fortunately on that occasion the victim escaped with minor injuries."

Agnieszka's husband said: "Agnieszka was my partner, my friend, my wife and the devoted mother of our three children.

"She was a women with a big heart, who was dedicated to her job and who trusted everyone.

"Our lives have been torn apart by Agnieszka's death and all we want is for the people responsible for her death to be held accountable, so that nobody else has to experience what we have been through."

Sergeant Cooper added: "Our investigation is very much ongoing and we are committed to doing all that we can to ensure that all those involved are held responsible for their actions.

"As part of our enquiries we want to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident, or anyone who knows who was behind the wheel at the time of the crash.

"I would urge anyone with any information, no matter how small, to contact the team here at Cheshire Police so that we can give Agnieszka's partner and her three children the best possible present this Christmas - justice."

Two men, age 18 and 20, from Stoke-on-Trent were arrested in connection with the incident and they are both on bail pending further enquiries.

Anyone with information or footage that may be relevant to the investigation is urged to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 804595, or give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report .
