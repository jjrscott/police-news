Detectives investigating an aggravated burglary in Poynton are appealing for information.

At around 1pm on Wednesday 5 February three men forced their way into a house on London Road North.

A woman was inside the house at the time.

The men, armed with a crow bar, ransacked the house demanding access to a safe and basement, before stealing a mobile phone.

They then left the scene in a blue Ford Fiesta.

The men are described as being of a slim build, around 5ft 8 in height and wearing black balaclavas and black jeans.

Detective Sergeant Stephen Joyce, from Macclesfield Local Policing Unit, said: "This burglary took place in broad daylight while the victim was inside the house.

"I am asking the public to come forward with information specifically around the three men and the car they were seen in.

"Did you see these men acting suspiciously in the area? Perhaps you saw the blue Ford Fiesta being driven in and around Poynton at around 1pm? If you did - or you have any other information - please get in touch to help with our investigation."
