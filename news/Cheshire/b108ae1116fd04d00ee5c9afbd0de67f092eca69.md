**Officers have released CCTV images of a man they want to speak to in connection with a criminal damage incident in Warrington town centre.**

The incident occurred at the Firkin Tap pub in Buttermarket Street at around 5am on Saturday 15 February.

It saw a man smash one of the pub's windows after repeatedly kicking it from outside.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and officers believe that the man in the CCTV images may have important information to aid their investigation.

They are urging anyone who recognises him or thinks they may know who he is to get in touch.

Police Constable Jack Brennan, of Warrington Local Policing Unit, said: "We are determined to establish who repeatedly kicked and smashed the window at the pub and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"We believe that the man in the CCTV images may have vital information to help us achieve that goal.

"If you think you recognise the man or know who he is please call us at Warrington Police Station on 101, quoting IML 637877, give us the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

"I would also like to appeal directly to the man in the CCTV images to get in touch."
