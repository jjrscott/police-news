Detectives are appealing for information following an attempted robbery in Runcorn.

At 8.50pm on Wednesday 10 March a man was walking in woodland near Halton Lodge Avenue when two men on bikes approached him.

The men demanded the victim handed over his mobile phone and money.

After the victim refused, the offenders assaulted him before riding away.

One of the men is described as white, aged in his 20s, around 6'2" tall and of a heavy build with long blonde hair. At the time of the incident, he was wearing a hooded camouflage jacket and a snood.

The second man was aged in his 20s, around 5'10" to 6' tall and of a medium build with short dark hair. He was wearing a black 'Timberland' jacket.

Both mountain bikes looked like they had been sprayed, one was dark grey and the other was black.

Officers are now appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the incident or information to contact Cheshire Police.

Detective Constable Nathaniel Walkowiak said: "The victim in this attack not only managed to keep his possessions but also managed to defend himself while sustaining minor injuries but the outcome could have been a lot worse.

"A number of enquiries have been ongoing in the local area and as part of these we are keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the incident or may remember spotting the offenders in the area around the time of the offence.

"The same goes to anyone who may have captured dashcam or CCTV footage of the two men on mountain bikes around the time of the incident."

Anyone with any information that could help police with their enquiries is asked to call 101 quoting IML 935616 or report it via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report

Alternatively, information can be passed on to Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 or via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
