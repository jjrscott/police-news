**Officers are appealing for information and dashcam footage following a collision involving three vehicles on a motorway in Warrington.**

The incident on the Thelwall Viaduct between junctions 20 and 21 of the M6 northbound involved two cars and a pickup truck.

The cars - a Mercedes-Benz A-Class 200 and a Kia Stonic - and the Mitsubishi Canter pickup truck were all white.

The pickup truck was on its side following the collision that occurred shortly before 4pm on Wednesday 25 November.

Thankfully only minor injuries were sustained as a result of the collision.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and no arrests have been made.
