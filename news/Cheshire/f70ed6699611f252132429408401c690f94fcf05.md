**Officers have released a CCTV image of a man they want to speak to in connection with a bag snatch incident in Handforth.**

It occurred at Wilmslow Road Car Park between 4pm and 4.15pm on Wednesday 24 March.

After cycling past a woman from Handforth in her 70s and grabbing her bag from her, a man rode off in the direction of The Paddock Shopping Centre on Wilmslow Road.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and officers want to hear from anyone who believes they may know who the man in the CCTV image is as they believe he will be able to aid their investigation.

Police Constable Matt Rowbotham said: "Thankfully the victim was not injured as a result of the incident, but it has understandably left her extremely shaken up.

"I would like to reassure members of the community that we take incidents of this nature seriously and are doing all we can to establish who stole the woman's bag stole and make him face the consequences of his actions.

"Enquiries are ongoing and I urge anyone who believes they may know the identity of the man in the CTTV image to contact us, as we believe that he will be able to help our investigation.

"I would also like to appeal directly to the man in the image to get in touch."

Anyone with information that may aid the investigation is asked to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 946420, or give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report.
