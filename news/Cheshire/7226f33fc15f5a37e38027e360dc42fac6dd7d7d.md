Detectives are appealing for information after a cash machine in Latchford was targeted by offenders.

At around 10.46pm on Thursday 28 May offenders approached the Co-operative convenience store at Bridge Shopping Centre on Maybrook Place in two vehicles - a black BMW and a white van.

Offenders forced open the shutter doors.

Once inside they attempted to remove the cash machine however it remained intact.

The van was left at the scene and the offenders fled in the BMW.

The car was later found abandoned on Hardwick Road in Partington.

Detective Sergeant Tom Hall said: "The investigation is progressing and a scene remains in place.

"I believe the offenders were disturbed during their attempt to steal the cash machine meaning they left empty handed.

"While we follow a number of enquiries I am appealing to the public to come forward with information to help us find those responsible and ensure they do not strike again.

"If you have CCTV or dash cam footage please do submit it through to us."

Anyone with information is asked to call Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 716381 or report it though the website https://www.cheshire.police.uk/

Information can also be submitted anonymously by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or by visiting their website https://www.crimestoppers-uk.org/
