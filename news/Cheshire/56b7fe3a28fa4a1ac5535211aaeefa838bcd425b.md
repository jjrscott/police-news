**Police investigating a burglary at a property in Prestbury are appealing for witnesses to come forward.**

Between 5.45pm and 6pm on Wednesday 4 December four offenders used tools and smashed a window to gain access to a detached house on Castle Hill.

Once inside, the men ransacked the main bedroom before leaving with a safe containing jewellery and a watch.

The men left the house by crossing the back garden and then drove away in a vehicle parked on Withinlee Road.

Anyone who may have witnessed these men or has any information is asked to contact Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IMl 580876.

Information can also be submitted through the Cheshire Police website https://www.cheshire.police.uk/
