**Detectives have released a CCTV image of two males they want to speak to in connection with an armed robbery at a convenience store in Warrington.**

A man working at the shop on Admirals Road in Birchwood was threatened by one of the males holding a knife and demanded he open the till.

The second male then grabbed the contents inside the till and the pair both fled the store with a large quantity of cash.

Enquiries in relation to the robbery, which took place between 6.30pm and 7.20pm on Thursday 8 October, are continuing.

Detectives believe that the males in the CCTV image may be able to assist with their investigation.

Detective Constable Darren Gibson, of Warrington CID, said: "Understandably the store worker was extremely shaken by the incident and we are working hard to find those responsible.

"As part of our enquiries we have been looking through CCTV footage and we believe the males in this image may have important information to help the investigation.

"Although their faces are covered they are wearing distinctive clothing and if you recognise them please get in touch.

"I would also encourage anyone who was in the area at the time and has information to please contact us."

If you have information please contact Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 823257.

Information can also be provided anonymously by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
