Detectives are appealing for information from the public following reports of a suspicious incident in Warrington.

At around 12.10am on Saturday 5 December officers were called by a concerned member of the public who reported being awoken after hearing shouting on Enfield Park Road in Fearnhead.

The caller stated that they had looked out of their window and witnessed a disagreement involving two men and a woman near to the entrance of Tweedsmuir Close.

Following the argument, one of the men and the woman got into a dark coloured estate car, and drove off into Tweedsmuir Close; the second man followed the vehicle on foot.

The witness believed that the woman may have potentially been forced into the car. However, officers are keeping an open mind as to what happened.

The first man is described as white, approximately 25-years-old, around 5' 10" tall with short dark hair. He was wearing a dark coloured jumper.

The second man was also described as white, approximately 35-years-old, around 6' tall, he was bald with broad shoulders and of stocky build. He was wearing a two tone coloured top.

The woman was believed to be 30-35-year-old, she was white and had brown hair which was tied in a ponytail. She was wearing a light coloured waterproof top.

Enquiries in relation to the incident have been ongoing and so far officers have been unable to identify any of those involved.

Detective Inspector Ian Robinson said: "Officers have conducted a number of enquiries including speaking to local residents and examining CCTV footage. Despite our efforts so far we have been unable to identify any of those involved.

"To date we have not had any potential victims come forward, nor have we had any reports of any missing people.

"Enquiries in relation to the incident remain ongoing and I would ask anyone with any information which may aid our investigation to get in touch.

"The same goes for any nearby residents with CCTV footage which may assist our enquiries."

Anyone with information or footage that may be relevant to the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 866380, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
