Officers from Warrington Local Policing Unit have arrested three teenagers following reports of anti-social behaviour, criminal damage and racial abuse.

Over the past week officers have been called to multiple incidents in the Bewsey area.

These have included racial abuse and criminal damage at a store in Folly Lane and eggs being thrown at homes in Troutbeck Avenue.

PC Donna Stevens, of Warrington LPU, said: "Over the past week the Warrington community has really come together to support each other following the devastating floods.

"Sadly, there have been a small number of people who have used the floods as an excuse to commit crime, which is the last thing that the local community needs.

"This type of behaviour is totally unacceptable and I want to reassure local residents we are doing all we can to ensure that those responsible are held accountable for their actions.

"We have already arrested three young people in relation to the incidents and dispersal orders have also been issued to a number of other teenagers.

"Investigations into the incidents are ongoing and I urge anyone who witnessed any of them, or believes they have information which may aid our enquiries, to get in touch.

"The same goes for anyone with any CCTV or dashcam footage of the incidents."

The three teenagers - two boys aged 15 and 16 and a 16-year-old girl - have all been released on conditional bail pending further enquiries.

Under their bail conditions they are not allowed to enter the Bewsey area.

Anyone with any relevant information or footage is asked to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting 21000052454, or give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report .
