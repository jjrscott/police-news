**Officers are asking the public to be vigilant following two indecent exposure incidents at a park in Birchwood.**

The first incident happened at around 5.20pm on Saturday 1 August and the second incident took place shortly after 3pm on Sunday 2 August at Walled Garden Oakwood Gate.

On the second occasion the man was in bushes before exposing himself to a number of young children.

The children ran away and alerted police.

The man police want to speak to is described as white, believed to be aged in his 30's and was wearing a black hat, grey jacket and black trousers.

Inspector Ruth Atherton, from Warrington Local Policing Unit, said: "First I want to reassure the local community that we are working hard to locate this man and people can expect to see officers regularly patrolling the area.

"While I do not want to panic the public I do want people to be vigilant and I would urge parents not to allow their children go to the park on their own.

"If anyone knows who this man might be or has information which will assist our investigation I would encourage you to contact us."

If you have any information please contact Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 769992 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
