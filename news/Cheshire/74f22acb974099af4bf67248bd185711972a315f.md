**Police are appealing for information from the public to help find a missing man from Warrington.**

Geoff Sutcliffe left his home in the Woolston area of the town between 10.30am and 12 noon on Wednesday 24 February.

The 61-year-old has not been seen since.

He is white, around 5' 7" tall and has a large build and very short grey hair.

Geoff was wearing a black zip-up hooded jacket, blue jeans and black and red Nike trainers when he left his home on foot.

He may have had a blue fleece jumper on underneath his jacket.

Inspector Danielle Knox said: "A number of officers have been searching for Geoff since he was reported as missing.

"We have been following various lines of enquiry, so far to no avail, and are becoming increasingly concerned for his welfare.

"He lives in Warrington and is likely to be in the town, though we can't rule out the possibility of him having gone further afield.

"I urge anyone in Warrington or elsewhere who thinks that they may have seen Geoff since he went missing to come forward.

"The same goes for anyone with information regarding his whereabouts, or CCTV or dashcam footage of him that was recorded since 10.30am on Wednesday 24 February.

"I also ask people living in the Woolston and surrounding area to aid our search for Geoff by checking their sheds and other outbuildings for any signs of him.

"In addition, I want to appeal directly to Geoff to make contact to let us and your family know that you are safe and well."

Anyone with information or footage that may assist officers in finding Geoff is asked to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 924672.
