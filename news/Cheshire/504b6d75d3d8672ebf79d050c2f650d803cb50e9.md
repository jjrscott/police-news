"As part as of our investigation we are keen to hear from anyone who may have captured CCTV or dashcam footage of the offenders to come forward.

"I am also keen to hear from anyone who may have been offered the items or may have seen something suspicious in the Greenfield Road area around at the time of the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to call Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 764711 or report it to us here.
