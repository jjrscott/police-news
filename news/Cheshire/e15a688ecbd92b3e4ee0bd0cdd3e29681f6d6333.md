Police are appealing for information from the public after two men were assaulted in Nantwich.

The victims, aged 22 and 18, were walking along Welsh Row, near to The Cheshire Cat hotel, at around 10.10pm on Saturday 17 October when a group of men on the opposite side of the road began to verbally abuse them.

The group of six men then crossed over the road and assaulted the victims, repeatedly punching the pair.

The offenders then walked off.

The victims were assessed at the scene by paramedics before being taken to Leighton Hospital as a precautionary measure.

The offenders are all described as white and in their late teens/early 20s. They were wearing grey and black jogging pants, hoodies and dark trainers.

The ringleader of the group had his hood up and was around 5' 10" tall.

Police Constable Steven Wood, of Crewe Local Policing unit, said: "The attack understandably left the victims shaken up and we are committed to doing all we can to trace the men responsible.

"Enquiries in relation to this incident are ongoing and we want to hear from anyone who witnessed the attack or has any other information which may aid our investigation.

"Perhaps you were in the area and saw the attack taking place, or witnessed the offenders fleeing the scene.

"We also want to hear from anyone who believes they may have dashcam or CCTV footage of the group of offenders."

Anyone with any information or footage that may help the investigation is urged to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 830414, or give the details online via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report .

Alternatively, information can be passed on to Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 or via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously .
