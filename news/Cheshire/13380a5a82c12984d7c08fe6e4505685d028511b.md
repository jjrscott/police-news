Detectives are appealing for information form the public following an incident in Ellesmere Port in which a man sustained serious injuries to his leg.

At around 1.30pm on Sunday 14 February officers were called to reports of an incident on a service road off Briarfield Road.

Officers attended and found a man who had sustained serious injuries to his leg.

The 23-year-old local man was taken to hospital, his injuries are not believed to be life threatening.

Detective Constable Michelle Flanagan said: "Enquiries in relation to this incident are in the early stages and we are trying to establish exactly what has taken place.

"As part of our enquiries we are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident or anyone with any information which may aid our investigation.

"The incident itself occurred in a service road off Briarfield Road and at the time of the occurrence there were two vehicles present - a black Vauxhall Corsa and a silver Vauxhall Corsa.

"As part of the investigation I'm keen to hear from anyone in the local area with any CCTV or dashcam footage of the cars travelling to or leaving the scene - it's likely that they will have travelled along Princes Road or Enfield Road.

"I'd urge anyone with any information, no matter how small to contact the team here at Ellesmere Port."
