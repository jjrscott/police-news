A man arrested following a serious assault at a shop in Alsager has now been charged.

Ben Beardsall was originally arrested by officers on Saturday 9 January by officers from Crewe Local Policing unit.

The 26-year-old has since been charged with Section 18 wounding with intent and possession of a knife in a public place.

The charges relate to an incident which occurred shortly after 6am on Friday 8 January where a 49-year-old woman was stabbed at a store on Shady Grove in Alsager.

The victim remains in hospital at this time where she is making a good recovery from her injuries.

Beardsall, of Lawton Road, Alsager, has been remanded in custody and is set to appear at Warrington Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 12 January.
