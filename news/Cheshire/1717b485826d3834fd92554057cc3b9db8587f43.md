Detectives have arrested a man in connection with a serious incident in Alsager.

The 26-year-old man was arrested this afternoon (Saturday 9 January) on suspicion of section 18 assault and he is currently in custody assisting officers with their enquiries.

At around 6.05am on Friday 8 January, the victim - a 49-year-old woman - was working at Premier Store on Shady Grove, when she noticed a customer who was looking in the fridge.

The woman approached the man and asked if she could help, at which point she was stabbed in the abdomen. The man then fled the scene on foot.

The victim was taken to the Royal Stoke Hospital for treatment where she remains in a stable condition.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and patrols have been stepped up in the local area.

Detective Inspector ClaIre Jesson said: "Understandably the local community Is shocked at what has happened. I'd like to reassure them that our enquiries are continuing and we are doing everything we can to establish the circumstances surrounding the incident and who is responsible.

"Officers will remain in the local area over the coming days and anyone with any concerns is urged to speak to a local officer."
