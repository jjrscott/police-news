Detectives have released a CCTV footage of a man they are looking to speak to in relation to a stabbing in Alsager.

At around 6.05am today, Friday 8 January, the victim, a 49-year-old woman, was working at Premier Store on Shady Grove, when she noticed a customer who was looking in the fridge.

The woman approached the man and asked if she could help, at which point she was stabbed in the abdomen. The offender then fled the scene on foot.

The victim was taken to the Royal Stoke Hospital for treatment, her injuries are not believed to be life threatening.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and as part of their investigation officers are keen to speak to the man in the CCTV images.

Detective Chief Inspector Adam Ross said: "This appears to have been a totally unprovoked attack and we are committed to doing all we can to trace the person responsible.

"I'd like to reassure the public that patrols are being stepped up in the area and anyone with any concerns should approach an officer.

"As part of our investigation we are keen to speak to the man in the CCTV images as we believe he may hold vital information.

"We're also urging anyone who was in the area and witnessed the incident, or anything else that may aid our investigation, to get in touch.

"The same goes for anyone with any CCTV or dashcam footage that may be relevant to our investigation.

"If you recognise the man, or if you have any information that may aid our investigation, please contact the team here at Crewe on 101."
