Burglars are continuing to target homes in Cheshire despite the current coronavirus crisis.

In the space of a week police received reports of 50 residential burglaries across the county.

Criminals have targeted sheds, outbuildings and garages stealing valuables from inside.

There were 16 incidents reported in Macclesfield, 10 in Warrington and eight in Chester - with a further 16 reported across the rest of the county.

Officers are continuing to carry out high-visibility patrols in the local community and are carrying out a number of enquiries in a bid to trace those responsible.

Residents are being urged to think about security in their home to reduce the chances of falling foul of thieves.

Superintendent Richard Rees said: "Despite the current lockdown, which is aimed at people staying at home to help save lives and protect the NHS, it is clear that thieves are still targeting homes in Cheshire.

"Criminals adapt to situations and will still find ways to commit crime even during difficult times like this.

"We need everyone to ensure they are thinking about security at home. During this period people are spending a lot of time out in their garden and clearing out their garage or shed and I'd encourage you to remember to keep them locked and secure.

"Even if you don't think a burglar would target your home, it's not worth the risk."

Residents can follow the simple safety advice below:

• Check outbuildings, sheds and garages are locked and secure
• Keep windows shut when unoccupied
• Keep personal items such as bikes and gardening tools stored away and out of sight
• Invest in strong padlocks to fit to sheds and/or garages or have them fitted with an alarm
