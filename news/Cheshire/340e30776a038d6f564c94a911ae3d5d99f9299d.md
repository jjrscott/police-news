**Police have released CCTV footage of what is believed to have been an attempted burglary in Alsager.**

At around 4am on Tuesday 14 January a man tried to open a car parked on a driveway on Crewe Road.

He then walked up to the house and attempted to open the front door.

After failing to gain access to both the car and the house the man walked away from the address.

PC Kerrie Cummings, of Crewe Local Policing Unit, said: "I am determined to identify the man in the CCTV footage and enquiries in relation to this are ongoing.

"As part of the investigation I am urging anyone who believes they may know the identity of the man or have any further information to report it to us."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 613877 or submit it through the website https://www.cheshire.police.uk/

PC Cummings added: "This also highlights the importance of ensuring that your vehicles and homes are secure at all times by locking doors and keeping windows shut."

Information can also be passed anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers https://www.crimestoppers-uk.org/
