Detectives investigating a robbery at a betting shop in Latchford are appealing for information and footage from the public.

The incident occurred at 8pm on Friday 24 January at BetFred on Reynolds Street.

A man entered the shop holding a knife and a bag and made demands to the employee to hand over money from the till.

He then fled on foot with a quantity of cash in an unknown direction.

The offender is described as being of a slim build, between 5ft 10 and 6ft in height, and was wearing black gloves and had his face covered.

Enquires in relation to the robbery are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone who was in the area and witnessed, or has dashcam footage of, anything that may help their investigation to get in touch.

They also want to speak to anyone who believes they may know who the offender is.

Detective Constable Chris Webster, of Warrington Local Policing Unit, said: "We have been conducting a number of enquiries to find the man responsible.

"To help with our investigation I am appealing to anyone who was in the area and believes they may have seen the offender, either before or after the robbery or as he was fleeing the area on foot, to contact us.

"If you think you may have dashcam footage of him or you think you know who he is please get in touch."
