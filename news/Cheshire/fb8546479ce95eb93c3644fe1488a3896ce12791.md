**The family of a woman who died in Congleton have paid tribute to her.**

Samantha Heap's body was discovered by officers at an address in Nursery Lane on the night of Tuesday 2 March.

David Mottram, of Nursery Lane, was arrested that night on suspicion of murdering the 45-year-old and has subsequently been charged with the offence.

In a statement, Samantha's family said: "Samantha had a real zest for life. She loved music and helping people, and she always saw the best in everyone.

"We are devastated by the tragic loss of her life."

Mottram, 47, appeared at Warrington Magistrates' Court on Thursday 4 March and at Chester Crown Court the following day, both via a video link.

He has been remanded in custody and is set to return to the crown court on Friday 28 May.

Samantha's family are being supported by specialist officers.
