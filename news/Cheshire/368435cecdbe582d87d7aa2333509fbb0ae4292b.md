An operation to recover a firearm in Runcorn has resulted in three people being arrested.

This morning (Wednesday 27 November) detectives raided a home on Dover Close in the Murdishaw area where one woman, aged 21, and two men aged 19 and 25 were detained.

They have been arrested on suspicion of offences including possession of a firearm and being concerned in the supply of class A drugs and are in custody where they will be questioned by officers.

Two other warrants were executed on Mooring Close and Talisman Close which resulted in two men being arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs.

During the raids police seized a shotgun at the address on Dover Close as well as cannabis.

Detective Inspector Nick Henderson, of Runcorn Local Policing Unit, said: "This morning has not only resulted in people being arrested but has also ensured a shotgun has been taken out of circulation to protect the wider community.

"As part of today's activity we also seized a quantity of drugs and I want to take this opportunity to encourage residents who believe drug activity could be taking place in their community to report it to us."

Residents who have information or believe drug activity is taking place in their community are encouraged to report it to Cheshire Police on 101 or through the website https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously via their website www.crimestoppers-uk.org/
