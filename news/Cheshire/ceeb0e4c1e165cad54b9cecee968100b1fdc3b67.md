**Cheshire Police 's Rural Crime Team joined forces with Cheshire West and Chester Council to target waste crime.**

The multi-agency operation, Operation Marsh, was launched to proactively target not only waste crime such as fly tipping, but also wildlife crime, off road bikes and anti-social behaviour on Frodsham Marsh and Ince Marsh.

The week-long operation, which took place between 26 and 29 January saw the teams working until late evening to tackle the issue.

;

PC Ashley Tether, who organised the operation, said: "This really has been a success, resulting in vehicles suspected of fly tipping being stopped and dealt with accordingly as well as number of other crimes being detected. It has been great opportunity to show that no matter how remote an area, and out of the way it is, criminal activity will be detected and investigated."

Officers involved in the operation stopped a number of vehicles which were subsequently seized and searched and a wildlife crime in progress was also detected.

PC Ashley Tether said: "Remember please use a legitimate waste provider; if the price is too good to be true for removal of waste then it could end up in our countryside. Also, it's your responsibility to ensure that you are using a legitimate waste provider. If your waste is found to be dumped, and not at an approved waste disposal facility, we'll be coming to your door!"

Cllr Karen Shore Deputy Leader of Cheshire West and Chester Council said, "This is the first in a number of operations the Council is undertaking in partnership with Cheshire Police's Rural Crime Team. Further enforcement activity is due to take place at the marshes and we really hope the outcome of this work will deter people from using this beautiful area to dispose of waste illegally. Anyone who is caught could face a large fine and a criminal record."

If you suspect someone isn't a legitimate waste provider, please report this to your local authority. If you see, or suspect fly tipping in progress, please dial 999 - that's because it's a criminal offence and a crime in progress.
