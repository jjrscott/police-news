Detectives investigating a robbery at a petrol station in Sandiway have released a CCTV image of a man they are looking to speak to.

The incident occurred at around 9pm on Sunday 7 February when a man entered the Shell garage at the junction of the A556, Chester Road and the A49, Forest Road.

After entering the store the offender, who was possibly armed, threatened a women who was working behind the counter and demanded that she handed over all of the cash.

He then stole the money from the safe and fled the store on foot, running towards the A49, in the direction of Cuddington.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives believe that the man in the CCTV images may have important information to aid their enquiries and are urging anyone who recognises him to get in touch.

Detective Constable Amy Lally, of Northwich CID, said: "This incident has understandably left the store worker extremely shaken and we are committed to doing all we can to trace the person responsible.

"As part of our ongoing enquiries, we have released CCTV images of a man we believe may have vital information to help our investigation.

"The man is wearing a distinctive face mask and I would ask anyone who thinks they know who he is to get in touch.

"We're also keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident and believes they may have witnessed the offender entering or fleeing the store.

"The same goes for anyone with any CCTV or dashcam footage that may be relevant to our investigation.

"If you have any information which may aid our investigation please the team here at Northwich on 101, quoting IML 912876, or give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report.

 "Alternatively, information can be reported anonymously, via Crimestoppers, on 0800 555 111."
