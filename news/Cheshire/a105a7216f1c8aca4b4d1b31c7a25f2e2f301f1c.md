Detectives investigating an assault in Middlewich are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At 1.50am on Sunday 3 November a 32-year-old man from Sandbach was assaulted on Booth Lane.

The victim suffered minor injuries to his face which required treatment at hospital.

Officers are also investigating whether the man was hit by a red Vauxhall Corsa.

A 31-year-old woman from Middlewich was arrested on suspicion of attempted wounding with intent and has been released under investigation.

Detective Sergeant Steve Smith, of Crewe Local Policing Unit, said: "We are currently following a number of lines of enquiry and I am appealing to the public to come forward if they were in the area at the time or have any information - no matter how small.

"I would particularly like to speak to a man who assisted the victim on Booth Lane as he may have information which could help with our investigation.

"If you have dashcam footage between 1am and 1.50am around the Booth Lane area please submit it through to us."

Anyone who has any information is asked to contact Cheshire Police on 101 or through the website https://www.cheshire.police.uk/contact/incident-update-form/ quoting IML 555613.
