Detectives investigating a number of bikes stolen across Warrington are urging parents and school children to be vigilant.

They have occurred near to schools when the children are travelling home.

A dedicated investigation into these incidents is continuing and a number of lines of enquiry are being followed.

Both plain clothed and uniformed officers will be patrolling key areas after school both as a deterrent and for reassurance.

In the meantime, police are strongly advising children to try and avoid travelling home alone and to stay with a group of friends.

Children are also being encouraged to consider taking a route home that would make them less vulnerable.

This includes not taking short cuts, cycling down back alleys or through parks and stay in well-lit and visible areas.

Parents are advised to record their child's bike serial number and to photograph the bike.

Detective Inspector Chris Maddocks, of Warrington Local Policing Unit, said: "We know there appears to be an increase lately in bikes being stolen from school children across Warrington.

"I want to reassure children and their parents that we are working hard to find those responsible.
"I do not want people to feel unsafe and that they can't go about their daily lives but as a pre-caution it is important to consider alternative routes.

"If a child is approached and they are threatened or their bike is stolen, please call 101 or 999 in an emergency."

If you have any information please contact Cheshire Police on 101 quoting Operation Sovereigns.
Information can also be provided anonymously by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or through their website www.crimestoppers-uk.org/
