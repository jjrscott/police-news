Police in Wilmslow are investigating reports of a young person on a bike cycling around the town verbally abusing and assaulting people.

PCSO James Morris said: "This has been flagged up to us as it has been a regular occurrence over the weekends for the past few months.

"We are looking carefully into these incidents and would encourage anyone who has been abused by a young man in his late teens on a bike recently but hasn't spoken to police to contact us.

"People should be able to go about their business without feeling threatened or feel in fear so we are determined to resolve this."

Anyone who witnesses such behaviour, is a victim, or has dash cam footage of the behaviour taking place should contact Cheshire Police on 101 or via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/
