Police in Runcorn are reminding residents to lock up their sheds and valuables following a number of thefts of bikes in the area.

Officers are continuing to investigate the burglaries and have put one man before the courts for a burglary in Norton Village.

The man appeared at North Cheshire Magistrates on Tuesday 24 November where he pleaded guilty to stealing a mountain bike from a brick outhouse in Norton Village on 14 November.

Lewis Dutton, 27, of Clapgate Crescent in Widnes was handed a 18 week prison sentence suspended for 12 months.

PC Dawn Taylor said: "While we continue to arrest and charge those who commit thefts and burglaries we would urge residents to think about their security and review how they can improve it.

"Often doors are unlocked and bikes aren't secure, giving opportunistic thieves the chance to steal a bike or other valuable items from outbuildings or sheds- and with Christmas round the corner, it's particularly important not to give them the chance. You can help us make it difficult for thieves by following a number of steps and denying them the opportunity to steal your hard earned property."

Tips on preventing shed or outbuilding burglaries:
• Check outbuildings, sheds and garages are locked and secure
• Keep windows shut when unoccupied
• Keep personal items such as bikes and gardening tools stored away and out of sight
• Invest in strong padlocks to fit to sheds and/or garages or have them fitted with an alarm
• CCTV is also an option to consider or security lights which come on when someone walks up it
• Look out for yourself and neighbours by reporting suspicious activity to police.
