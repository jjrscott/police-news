Police are appealing for information following a suspicious incident in Alsager.

At around 6pm on 15 February a 16-year-old girl was walking onto Audley Road from the alleyway at the top of Meadowcroft when she became aware of a man behind her. He walked past her but appeared to be staring at her and tried to engage her in conversation. The teenager walked away from him but he continued to follow and try to speak with her.

She was scared by his behaviour and went to a nearby house to seek help and police were informed. The man was last seen walking towards the golf course.

The suspect is described as 5ft 7 to 5ft 11, white, aged in his mid 30's with dark brown, short hair, and a dark brown beard. His hair was not styled.

He was wearing a 'Bomber' jacket with no hood which was dark grey and what looked like a burgundy shirt. He also had dark grey/black coloured jeans. She could only describe his accent as 'foreign'.

PC Kerrie cummings said: "Despite the teenager clearly looking alarmed by this man's constant attention and attempts to speak with her he continued leaving her afraid of the situation she was in. While we don't know what his intentions were he was clearly not concerned about the affect he was having.

"We made a search of the area at the time but did not locate anyone matching the description so we are making further enquiries in the area. If you have any information or you see suspicious behaviour, please contact us."

Anyone with information should contact Cheshire Police on 101 or via www.cheshire.police.uk quoting IML 918405. Alternatively information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
