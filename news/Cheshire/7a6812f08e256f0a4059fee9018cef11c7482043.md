Police in Warrington are appealing for information following a number of bike thefts at high schools and colleges.

Between 10am and 11.00am on Thursday 9 January one bike was stolen from a school on Louchers Lane.

While on Friday 10 January two bikes were taken. One from a high school on Brock Road in Birchwood between 8am and 3pm and another from a high school on Hall Drive between 8.30am and 3.15pm.

As part of the investigation a 26-year-old man from Warrington voluntarily attended and was interviewed. Following enquiries no further action was taken.

Enquiries have been ongoing since then and this week officers have released a CCTV image of two men they want to speak to in-connection with the thefts.

PC Donna Stevens, of Warrington Local Policing Unit, said: "Our enquiries in relation to the thefts are continuing and as part of my investigation I have released a CCTV image of two men who may have important information.

"If you think you recognise them or know who they are please call Cheshire Police on 101 quoting 20000021503, give details through our website or by calling Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

"I would also like to appeal directly to the men in the image to get in touch."
