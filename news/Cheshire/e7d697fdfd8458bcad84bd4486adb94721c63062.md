**Three men have been charged in connection with the thefts of catalytic converters from cars in Warrington.**

Seamus Maughan, Terence Mongan and Francis Mongan, all of Mere Lane, Bitteswell, Lutterworth, Leicestershire, were arrested shortly after a car was stopped by officers in the Gemini Retail Park area of Warrington at around 8.30pm on Friday 16 October.

The trio have all subsequently been charged with two counts of theft from a motor vehicle.

These charges relate to the thefts of catalytic converters from two cars in Warrington earlier that day, on Station Road and Knutsford Road in Grappenhall.

Maughan, 38, Terence Mongan, 45, and Francis Mongan, 19, have also been charged with going equipped for theft.

Maughan has been charged with driving whilst disqualified as well.

The trio appeared at Crewe Magistrates' Court on Monday 26 October, via a video link.

Maughan and Terence Mongan were remanded in custody and Francis Mongan was released on conditional bail.

They are all set to appear at Chester Crown Court on Monday 23 November.
