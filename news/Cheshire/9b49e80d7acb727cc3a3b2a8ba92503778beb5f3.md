**A 41-year-old man has been charged with four offences following an incident in Widnes.**

Yan Marzelos was arrested in Monarch Court, Queens Avenue, shortly after midnight on Saturday 8 August.

He has since been charged with assault by beating, affray, causing criminal damage and threatening a person with an offensive weapon in a public place.

The charges relate to an incident that occurred in Monarch Court shortly before Marzelos was arrested.

A 25-year-old man from Widnes sustained a minor head injury as a result of the incident that did not require hospital treatment.

Marzelos, of Monarch Court, appeared at Warrington Magistrates' Court, via a video link, on Monday 10 August.

He was remanded in custody and is set to appear at Liverpool Crown Court on Monday 7 September.
