Police are appealing for witnesses following an attempted robbery in Over Road near Church Minshull.

At about 4.40pm on Monday 18 January a man was working in his tool sales van in a layby. As he went to the front of his van he was approached by a man carrying a metal bar.

The man said nothing but hit the victim in the face with the bar causing injuries.

At this point the suspect lost his footing and the victim pushed him. A passing car beeped its horn causing the suspect to run to a white Astra van and drive off towards Winsford.

PC Mark Brameld said: "The victim was left injured and shocked by his ordeal. As part of our enquiries into the incident, we are asking anyone who witnessed the incident, or was in the area at the time and has dashcam footage that may help us identify the suspect and his van to contact us."

Anyone with information should call 101 or contact us via www.cheshire.police.uk quoting IML 897554.

Alternatively information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
