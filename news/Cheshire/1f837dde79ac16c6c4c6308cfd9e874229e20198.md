Officers are appealing for information after a cannabis farm was discovered at an address in Crewe.

At around 9.50am on Saturday 2 May officers discovered more than 100 cannabis plants at an address of Bedford Street.

Following a search of the property officers seized 112 plants and a quantity of growing equipment.

Officers are now appealing for more information to find those responsible.

Constable Tom Towe from Crewe South Beat Management said: "The plants and growing equipment have been seized and thankfully these drugs never made it onto the streets of Crewe.

"The Crewe South Beat Management Team is dedicated to tackling drug supply in the community and we will not tolerate drug dealing and won't allow properties to be used for the production of cannabis.

"We are following several lines of enquiry to trace those responsible and I would urge anyone who has seen any suspicious activity around Bedford Street in Crewe over the last few months to please get in touch so that we can bring the offenders to justice."

Anyone with any information is asked to call Cheshire Police via 101, quoting IML 695472 or report it online via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report/

Alternatively, information can be passed on to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
