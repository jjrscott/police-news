Detectives investigating how a man came to sustain serious injuries in Crewe are appealing for a number of people to come forward.

Officers want to speak to anyone who walked from Crossville car park, down the steps onto the Phoenix Leisure Park, between midnight on Friday 1 November and 2am on Saturday 2 November.

Following CCTV enquiries, detectives would like the group of five men and the individual two men and woman, who can be seen walking up and down the steps, to come forward.

It was shortly before 2am on Saturday 2 November that the 44-year-old local man was found collapsed by a passer-by on a car park on Chester Street. He was taken to Royal Stoke Hospital by ambulance and remains in a critical condition.

Detective Inspector Claire Jesson said: "We remain committed to ascertaining how the man came to sustain these injuries and we have been following a number of lines of enquiry.

"As part of my investigation I am keen to speak to all the people who walked from Crossville car park, down the steps to Phoenix Leisure Park between midnight and 2am, shortly before the man was found. By coming forward we can establish if you have information - no matter how small - that could help our investigation.

"I also want to encourage anyone else who has information or may have been in the vicinity, to get in touch. If you do not feel comfortable speaking to an officer, you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 555159, or provide details through the website https://www.cheshire.police.uk/contact/incident-update-form/

Information can also be provided anonymously through the Crimestoppers website https://crimestoppers-uk.org/ or by calling 0800 555 111.
