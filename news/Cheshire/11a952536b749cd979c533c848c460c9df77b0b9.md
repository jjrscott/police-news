Detectives investigating a burglary in Vicars Cross are appealing for information from the public.

The burglary occurred at a house on Melrose Avenue between 7.30pm and 8pm on Monday 17 February.

Three men accessed the house through a secure gate before forcing their way inside.

The trio then ransacked the house before being challenged by the occupant who threatened to call police.

One of the men grabbed the woman's phone and stole it along with a quantity of cash.

They then left the house in an unknown direction.

Two of the men are described as around 6ft in height and were dressed in black.

One of the two men had their face covered while the other man's hood was up and he appeared to have a long face.

The third man was wearing black clothing.

Detective Constable Keith Campbell, from Chester Local Policing Unit, said: "Having your home burgled is always deeply upsetting for the victim.

"We are determined to do all we can to find the men who targeted this woman's home and stole from her.

"As part of my enquiries I am asking the public to come forward with information. Do you know who the men are or did you see them acting suspiciously in the area?

"Perhaps you have dashcam footage which could help with the investigation? If so, please get in touch with us."

If you have any information or dashcam footage you can contact Cheshire Police through the website https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ or by calling 101 quoting IML 639841.

Information can also be submitted anonymously through the Crimestoppers website crimestoppers-uk.org/
