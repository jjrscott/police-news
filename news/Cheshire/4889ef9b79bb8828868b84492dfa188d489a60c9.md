**Officers are appealing for information and footage from members of the public following an arson incident in the Chester area.**

At around 9pm on Wednesday 22 July firefighters were informed of a blaze involving two white light goods vehicles in a Marcher Court car park off Sealand Road in Blacon.

The fire destroyed one of the LGVs and caused significant damage to the other before being extinguished by firefighters.

It also caused minor radiated heat damage to a white commercial vehicle parked nearby.

The fire is believed to have been started deliberately.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and officers are urging anyone with any information or footage that may aid their investigation to get in touch.

Detective Inspector Nick Henderson, of Chester Local Policing Unit, said: "Fire spreads quickly and can put lives as well as properties and possessions in danger.

"Thankfully no-one was injured as a result of this arson incident but it has resulted in three vehicles being damaged, one of which has been left completely destroyed.

"I would like to reassure members of the community that this is believed to be an isolated incident and we are determined to establish who started the fire and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"As part of our ongoing enquiries we want to speak to anyone who was in the area and believes they may have seen something that could help our investigation.

"We also want to hear from anyone who thinks they may know who started the fire, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of them."

Anyone with information or footage that may be relevant to the investigation is asked to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 761374, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
