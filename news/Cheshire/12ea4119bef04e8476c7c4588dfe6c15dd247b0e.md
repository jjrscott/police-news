Detectives are appealing for information from the public following two robberies at an off-licence in Crewe.

At around 9.50pm on Saturday 4 January a man, believed to be armed with scissors, entered Bargain Booze on Kings Drive, Wistaston, and demanded money.

He stole money, cigarettes and alcohol before fleeing the shop towards the car park.

The man is described as white, around 6' tall, of thin build and aged around 30 to 40-years-old. He was wearing a dark green coat, dark tracksuit bottoms and grey trainers with a white snood, a black snood, a dark glove and a light coloured glove.

Officers were then called to another incident at the same shop at around 9.10pm on Wednesday 8 January after two men, both believed to be armed with hammers, entered the shop and demanded money.

The pair stole money and cigarettes before running off through the front door.

The men were both wearing a black jacket with the hood up with black tracksuit bottoms, dark trainers and dark coloured gloves.

One of the men had a white trim down the sides of the jacket.

At this stage, this latest incident is not believed to be linked to the first incident.

Detectives have now issued CCTV images of three men they would like to speak to in connection with both incidents.

Detective Constable Simon Knowles, from Crewe CID, said: "These incidents are particularly shocking and although no-one was injured, the outcome could have been a lot worse.

"We are determined to track down those responsible for both incidents and bring them to justice.

"We are keen to trace the men in the CCTV images and would ask anyone with any information to come forward.

"If you were in the Kings Drive area on Saturday 4 January or Tuesday 7 January around the times of the robberies and saw anything suspicious we would like to hear from you."

Anyone with information into the robbery on Saturday 4 January is urged to get in touch with Cheshire Police on 101 by quoting IML 604795, alternatively report it online via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/

Alternatively, anyone with information into the incident on Wednesday 8 January is asked to get in touch with Cheshire Police on 101 by quoting IML 607712, alternatively report it online via our website.

Information can also be passed to independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via the Crimestoppers Website.
