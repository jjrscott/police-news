**Detectives investigating a serious assault in Ellesmere Port are appealing for information and footage from members of the public.**

The incident occurred on Chester Road in Little Sutton, near to the Smithy Lane junction, at 8.20pm on Christmas Eve.

A 39-year-old man from Ellesmere Port sustained a serious head injury as a result of the incident.

He was taken to hospital in an ambulance.

His condition in hospital is currently described as critical but stable.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing.

Detective Inspector Andy Fletcher said: "We are currently in the very early stages of our investigation into the serious assault that has left a 39-year-old man in a critical condition in hospital.

"No weapons are believed to have been used during the assault.

"I would like to reassure the community that this appears to have been an isolated incident and we are doing everything we can to establish who carried out the assault and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"Enquires are ongoing and I urge anyone with any information about the incident itself or those involved in it to get in touch to assist the investigation.

"The same goes for anyone with any CCTV, mobile phone or dashcam footage that may be relevant to the investigation."
