**Detectives are appealing for information and footage from members of the public following a robbery at a convenience store in Runcorn.**

The robbery at the McColl's store in Village Square, Castlefields, was committed by two males wearing face coverings at around 6.15am on Friday 13 March.

One of them was carrying a crowbar.

The offenders threatened a member of staff and stole a quantity of cash and cigarettes.

They then fled the store on foot, in the direction of Kingshead Close.

The offenders were both white, wearing dark clothing and spoke with a local accent.

One of them was around 5' 10" tall and had a slim build.

The other looked two or three inches shorter and had a heavy build.

Detective Sergeant Rob McLoughlin, of Runcorn Local Policing Unit, said: "This was a terrifying ordeal for the members of staff and the customer who were in the store during the robbery.

"They have understandably been left shaken up and we are committed to doing all that we can to identify the offenders and bring them to justice.

"Our investigation is currently in the very early stages and we are following a number of lines of enquiry.

"As part of our investigation we want to hear from anyone who was in the area and believes that they may have seen, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of, the offenders.

"We also want to speak to anyone who believes that they may know who the offenders are or have any other information that may aid our enquiries."

Anyone with information that may help detectives with their investigation, no matter how small, should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 659433, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
