Police in Macclesfield are investigating reports of suspicious activity in the town.

Between 9 and 14 January there have been seven incidents involving a man behaving suspiciously and causing a nuisance in the Bridge Street, West Bond Street and Star Lane areas.

The man has been seen filming dog walkers in South Park and has also allegedly exposed himself in Moss Lane.

Officers from Macclesfield Local Policing Unit are investigating the incidents and are keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed similar suspicious behaviour in the town and have not yet reported it to police.

Sgt Kerrie Snowdon said: "I want to reassure all those living locally that we are aware of these incidents and a number of enquiries are ongoing. We have increased patrols in the area - if you are concerned or have any information then we would urge you to speak to a local officer.

"We want everyone to be able to go about their business without feeling intimated or uncomfortable.

"This behaviour is clearly causing concern within the local community and we are keen to gather as much information as we can about these incidents to understand exactly what is happening. We also believe there could have been other incidents that have not yet been reported and if you have any information that could help us then please get in touch."

As part of enquiries into the incidents police have arrested a 41-year-old man who is currently assisting police with their investigation.

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 or via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/ quoting 20000032252. Alternatively information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
