Detectives investigating a robbery at a convenience store in Lymm are appealing for information and footage from members of the public.

At around 6am today, Friday 29 November, two men wearing face coverings broke into the Co-op in Chaise Meadow via the front door.

One of the men was armed with a crowbar, and although the store was closed to the public two people were working inside.

The offenders demanded cash and cigarettes from the workers.

After stealing a quantity of cash and cigarettes the men are believed to have fled in a dark coloured car.

The hatchback had no headlights on as it travelled along Chaise Meadow onto the mini roundabout on Birchbrook Road.

Both of the offenders were dressed all in black and were wearing face coverings and hooded tops with the hoods up.

The man who was armed with a crowbar is described as white, around 5' 10" tall and slim.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone who was in the area and witnessed, or has dashcam footage of, anything that may aid their investigation to get in touch.

They also want to speak to anyone who believes they may know who the offenders are.

Detective Constable Tom Ashton, of Warrington CID, said: "This was a frightening incident that has understandably left the store workers shaken up.

"We are determined to establish the identities of the offenders and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"Enquiries are ongoing and I urge anyone who was in the area and believes they may have seen the men, either before the robbery or as they were fleeing the area, to contact the team here at Warrington CID.

"The same goes for anyone who thinks they may know who the offenders are or have dashcam footage of them.

"We believe that they fled in a dark coloured hatchback with no headlights on."

Anyone with information or dashcam footage that may help detectives with their investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 576444, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk or contact independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
