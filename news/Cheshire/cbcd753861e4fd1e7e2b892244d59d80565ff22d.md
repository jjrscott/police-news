Officers are appealing for witnesses and dashcam footage after a woman was seriously assaulted in a supermarket car park in Warrington.

At around 4pm on Saturday 23 November a 41-year-old man and a 42-year-old woman became involved in an argument on the car park outside Sainsbury's supermarket on Church Street.

Following a verbal disagreement the woman, who is from the Warrington area, was seriously assaulted near to the disabled parking bays.

The woman was taken to Warrington District General Hospital; she has since been discharged and is currently recovering at home.

Police Constable Callum Cuerden said: "The victim in this case suffered serious injuries and we are committed to doing all that we can to ensure the person responsible is brought to justice.

"Sainsbury's on Church Street is a busy supermarket and I believe there would have been a number of people in the area at the time the incident took place whom may have witnessed the assault.

"As part of my investigation I want to hear from anyone who believes they may have witnessed the incident or anyone with any information which may aid our investigation.

"The same goes for any motorists who were driving on the car park between 4pm and 4.15pm and believes they may have captured the incident on their dashcams".

Anyone with information or dashcam footage that may aid the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 572150, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

A 41-year-old man from Warrington has been arrested on suspicion of assault in connection with the incident; he has been released on conditional bail pending further enquiries.
