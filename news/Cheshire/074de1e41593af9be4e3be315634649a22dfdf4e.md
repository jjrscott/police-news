Detectives are appealing for witnesses and dashcam footage following an attempted ATM attack at a convenience store in Widnes.

Shortly after 10.30pm on Thursday 12 March a silver car pulled into the car park at the front of the Morrison's Daily store on Liverpool Road.

Three men, all wearing face coverings and gloves, then got out of the vehicle and attached a large metal chain to the tow bar.

The men then walked into the store and wrapped the chain around the cash machine.

One man then got back into the car and drove off in an attempt to pull the front off the cash machine.

After failing to open the machine, all three men then got back into the car and drove off.

The driver of the car was wearing a black jacket, black trainers and dark trouser.

The second offender was wearing a blue bubble jacket, black balaclava, black pants and grey trainers with white soles.

The third man was wearing a black jacket with the hood up, a black face covering, small black pack back with grey zip section and black trainers with grey soles.

Two members of staff and one customer were present at the time of the incident.

Detective Inspector Ian Whiley, of Widnes CID, said: "While there were no injuries, those present at the time of the incident have understandably been left shaken as a result of their ordeal.

"I would like to reassure the local community that we are doing all that we can to trace the men responsible and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"As part of our enquiries were keen to hear from anyone who witnesses the incident or anyone with any information which may aid our Investigation.

"The same goes for motorists with dashcams who were driving along Liverpool Road between 10pm and 11pm on Thursday 12 March.

"We also want to hear from any residents on Liverpool Road with CCTV cameras who believe they may have footage of the car travelling past their homes.

"I ask anyone with any information which may assist our investigation to contact the team here at Widnes CID on 101."

Anyone with any information which may assist the investigation, no matter how small, is urged to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 659326, or give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report .

Alternatively, information can be reported to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
