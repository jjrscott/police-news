**Police are appealing for information from the public to help find a missing man.**

Josef Skrdlant has not been seen since he left his home in the Queens Park area of Crewe on foot at around 10am on Friday 19 February.

The 51-year-old is around 5' 2" tall with a proportionate build.

He is white with a tanned complexion and has brown eyes and black hair that is greying and receding.

When Josef was last seen he was wearing a black jacket, blue jeans and blue shoes.

He is originally from the Czech Republic and speaks very little English.

Josef has recently moved back to Crewe from Birmingham.

Cheshire Constabulary is urging anyone who sees him or has any information regarding his whereabouts to come forward.

Inspector Dave Levins, of Crewe Local Policing Unit, said: "This is the first time that Josef Skrdlant has been reported as missing to the police.

"A number of officers have been searching for him, so far to no avail, and we are becoming increasingly concerned for his welfare.

"He lives in Crewe but has recently been living in Birmingham.

"I urge anyone in those areas or elsewhere who thinks that they may have seen Josef since he went missing to get in touch with us.

"The same goes for anyone with any information regarding his whereabouts, or CCTV or dashcam footage of him since he went missing on the morning of Friday 19 February."

Anyone with information or footage that may help officers find Josef is asked to call Cheshire Constabulary immediately on 101, quoting IML 922551.
