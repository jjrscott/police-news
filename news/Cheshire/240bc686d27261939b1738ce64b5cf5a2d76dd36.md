The family of Ann-Marie Chesters have paid tribute to her after she died following a collision with a lorry on the Haslington Bypass last week.

The collision occurred at 1.52am on Tuesday 14 January near to Crewe Green roundabout. Ann-Marie (37) was taken to hospital but sadly died.

Her family said: "On Tuesday 14 January 2020 our lives were torn apart. Being told of the collision in which Annie was involved came as a great shock to us all. Annie was a fantastic daughter, sister and aunty; such a loveable person often referring to her sister, Lyn, as her Baby Girl.

"Annie was always there for her family and a very kind hearted person too; she had a great sense of humour and really knew how to cheer people up and make them laugh.

"Annie tried to fight her injuries but they were just too severe and passed away just after 03:30hrs on Wednesday 15th January 2020.

"Our family would like to say thank you to the driver of the vehicle involved for staying with Annie at her time of need and doing what he could for her."
