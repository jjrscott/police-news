**Detectives investigating an arson attack at a Chinese restaurant in Alderley Edge are appealing for information from members of the public.**

The YU restaurant on Wilmslow Road was broken into at around 3.30am on Saturday 9 May.

Petrol was then poured onto the floor in the bar area and set alight.

Fortunately the fire only caused relatively minor damage to the restaurant, damaging an area surrounding the bar and some bar stools.

The restaurant also sustained smoke damage as a result of the fire.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone with any information or footage that may aid their investigation to get in touch.

Detective Sergeant Simon Mills, of Macclesfield Local Policing Unit, said: "No-one was inside the restaurant when it was broken into and thankfully the fire went out by itself and caused only relatively minor damage to the premises.

"The consequences of this incident could have been far worse. If the fire had spread it could have endangered lives as well as neighbouring properties.

"We are determined to establish who started the fire and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"Enquiries are ongoing and as part of our investigation we want to speak to anyone who was in the area in the early hours of Saturday 9 May and witnessed anything suspicious.

"We also want to hear from anyone who thinks they may know who started the fire, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of them."

Anyone with information or footage that may help the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 700902, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
