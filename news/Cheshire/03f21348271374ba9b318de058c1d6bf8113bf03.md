The Prime Minister has announced strict new social measures in a bid to slow the spread of coronavirus.

This is an unprecedented time for all of us and I appreciate that this will continue to cause concern amongst our communities in Cheshire.

I want to reassure all residents in Cheshire that we are here working as hard as we can, alongside our partners, to keep you safe and ensure the most vulnerable are protected.

But it is important to remember that everyone must comply with these measures, which are there to protect our fantastic NHS and save lives. The police are to be given the powers to enforce the powers, when it becomes necessary and proportionate to do so.

We are asking the public to listen to the advice, stay at home and help us to help the national effort.

British policing is founded on respect and engagement with the public - we resolve issues daily by talking to people and reasoning with them and that will continue.

Our officers will continue to provide a visible presence in your community and I am very grateful for the continued support that will be offered by the Special Constabulary and other volunteers.

If you do need our help then we are here.

In an emergency, where there is a threat to life or a crime is taking place, please call 999.

If it isn't an emergency it is possible to report incidents via our website, which I would encourage you to use when possible, or call 101.

If you need information and advice following on from the coronavirus announcement by the Prime Minister please visit http://orlo.uk/wogej

We all need to continue to work together to protect and support each other during this challenging time.

**Chief Constable**
