**Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a robbery at an off licence in Crewe.**

At around 4.15pm on Tuesday 7 January a man, who is thought to have been in possession of a knife, entered JD's Off Licence on Coleridge Way and demanded a quantity of cash.

The offender stole a quantity of cash and cigarettes before fleeing the scene on a black mountain bike in the direction of the town centre.

No injuries have been reported.

The man has been described as white and around 5ft 7in. He was wearing a khaki green jacket, black gloves, black tracksuit bottoms, grey coloured trainers and had two carrier bags.

Detectives are now appealing for anyone who may have seen anything suspicious around the time of the incident to come forward.

Detective Constable Victoria Greenhoff said: "The investigation is currently in the early stages and enquiries are ongoing.

"The incident has understandably left staff from the off licence shaken and we are doing everything possible to track down the offender and bring him to justice.

"I would like to ask anyone who may have CCTV or dashcam footage in the area and around the time of the robbery to come forward.

"I also want to appeal to anyone who may have information, no matter how small, to get in touch."

Anyone with information that may help detectives with their investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 606698 , or give the details via our website.

Information can also be passed to independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via Crimestopper's website.
