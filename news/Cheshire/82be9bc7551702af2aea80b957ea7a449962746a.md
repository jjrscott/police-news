Roads have now reopened following a gas leak on Holmes Chapel Road in Middlewich.

As a precaution, a small number of homes and businesses within 50m (the darker pink circle) of the gas leak in Middlewich were evacuated.

A cordon was in place preventing access to the wider surrounding area (the lighter pink circle), with road closures on the A54 Holmes Chapel Road from the Salt Cellar roundabout to the Town Bridge traffic lights, and also at King Street.
