Detectives investigating two burglaries in Nantwich are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

One burglary occurred on Sunday 16 February on Birchin Lane at some time between 2.50am and 3.25am.

The burglar has entered the house through the back door, searched the property and stolen cash and jewellery.

The occupants were asleep at the time.

On the same day, Sunday 16 February, another burglary took place at a home on Princess Drive at around 6am.

The suspect entered the property by forcing open the window in the kitchen.

The rooms were ransacked and the burglar stole cash.

The occupant was inside the home at the time.

The burglar is described as being shorter than 5ft 10 in height and of a slim build.

Police are linking both offences and reminding residents to check the security of their homes.

Detective Sergeant Stephen Richardson, from Crewe Local Policing Unit, said: "Understandably the victims have been left shaken and are being supported by officers.

"A number of lines of enquiry have been progressed and I believe the same burglars have targeted these two homes.

"To help the investigation I am appealing to the public to come forward if they saw any suspicious activity in the area or if they have any information or dashcam footage.

"I also want to remind residents to be extra security aware by ensuring all doors and windows are kept shut and locked, even while you're inside."
