Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a motorcyclist sustained serious injuries following a collision near Kelsall.

At around 1.25pm on Saturday 4 January a black and red Suzuki motorcycle collided with the central reservation on the A54 Kelsall Bypass.

The rider of the bike, a 40-year-old woman from Ellesmere Port, sustained serious injuries and was airlifted to hospital. She is currently in a critical but stable condition.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and officers are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision or anyone with any dashcam footage which may aid their investigation.

PC Liz Thompson, from the Cheshire Police Serious and Complex Collision Investigation Unit said: "The female involved in this collision is currently in a critical condition and we are committed to doing all that we can to establish exactly what took place.

"The incident occurred on a busy Saturday afternoon on one of the main routes into Chester and as part of my investigation I'm keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision.

"The same goes for anyone who was driving in the area and believes they have any dashcam footage which may be relevant to the investigation."

Anyone who witnessed the collision, or anyone with any information that may assist the investigation, is asked to contact Cheshire Police on 101, quoting IML 604417 or visit https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/ .
