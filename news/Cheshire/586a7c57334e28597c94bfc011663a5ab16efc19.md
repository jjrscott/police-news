A 49-year-old man from Chester has been charged with class A drugs offences after warrants were executed simultaneously at two addresses in the city.

Shaun Shirtliff was arrested shortly after the warrants were executed by officers in Bouverie Street and City Road.

A quantity of what are believed to be class A drugs were seized during the raids, which took place at around 4pm on Thursday 9 April.

Shirtliff, of Bouverie Street, has subsequently been charged with two counts of possession with intent to supply class A drugs (heroin and crack cocaine).

He appeared before Warrington Magistrates' Court on Saturday 11 April.
Shirtliff has been remanded in custody and is due to appear at Chester Crown Court on Tuesday 5 May.

Two other men from Chester, aged 30 and 40, were also arrested following the raids. They have since been released under investigation pending further enquiries.
