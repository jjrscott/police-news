Police in Macclesfield are appealing for information after a man in his 70s was discovered unresponsive by the roadside.

At around 11pm on 16 December a taxi driver discovered the unresponsive man by Park Mount Drive, Macclesfield and gave first aid. Emergency services attended and he was taken to Macclesfield Hospital, where he remains in a serious but stable condition.

"If anyone has found a wallet in the Macclesfield Road or Park Mount Road Drive and has yet to hand it in to police, please contact us.

"If you were in the area around 11pm that night and saw anything suspicious or have dash cam footage that my help us to piece together exactly what has taken place, I'd also urge you to contact us."

Anyone with information or dashcam footage should contact PC Nicola Williamson on 101 or via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/ quoting IML 590398.
