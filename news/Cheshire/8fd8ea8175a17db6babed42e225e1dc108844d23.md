A man from Widnes has been jailed after admitting stealing from a shop and being in possession of a knife.

Maxwell Carroll, 45, from Brandon, Widnes appeared at North Cheshire Magistrates Court on 16 December and pleaded guilty to theft from a shop and possession of a knife blade in a public place. He was also sentenced for failing to comply with the requirement of post custodial supervision.

He was sentenced to 26 Weeks in prison.

At around 3.40pm on 15 December Carroll entered a shop in Lugsdale Road, Widnes and took Lipsy products and room diffusers worth more than Â£100, and made no attempt to pay, which was reported to police.

A description was put out to officers and a PCSO spotted a man matching his profile in Salisbury Street a short time later. The man was confirmed as Carroll and he was carrying a number of shopping bags. An officer was dispatched to search Carroll and he was found in possession of the stolen products, a Stanley knife and an adapted razor blade.

Carroll was arrested and admitted taking the items from the shop.

PC Matthew Jennings said: "This is a great example of how your local policing unit is working together in the town to catch thieves and keep people safe from harm. I hope this reassures those who live and work in Widnes that we are committed to policing your community."
