Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an indecent exposure in Warrington.

Sometime between 2pm to 2.30pm on Wednesday 23 October a woman was walking in Grappenhall Hayes Woodland Trust when a male cycled over to her and exposed himself.

He was wearing a grey hoodie which was zipped up to the top, black sport shorts, white trainers and had a white mountain bike with rubber grips on the tyres.

Officers have now released an E-fit of a man they want to speak to in connection with this incident.

PC Kerif Smythe, of Warrington LPU, said: "I would urge anyone who may recognise the man to come forward as they may have crucial information to help us with our investigation.

"If you saw anyone acting suspiciously in the area around the time of the incident we would urge you to get in touch."

Anyone with information can contact Cheshire Constabulary on 101 or via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about quoting IML 546835.

Information can also be passed on to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via the online form https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
