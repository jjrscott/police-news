Detectives investigating a man seriously assaulted in Nantwich have arrested two men.

On Wednesday 29 July a 42-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and a 50-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. Both men were arrested at separate addresses and are currently in police custody.

At 8.20pm on Sunday 27 July police were made aware of a man inside a flat on Tailors View, Arnold Street who had suffered severe injuries to his head.

The 39-year-old was taken to hospital where he remains in a critical but stable condition in hospital.

Leading the investigation Detective Inspector Claire Jesson said: "This is a fast moving investigation and we are continuing to follow a number of lines of enquiry to establish the full circumstances.

"The man sustained horrific injuries during the attack, which I believe took place between 3pm and 4.30pm.

"I am still urging anyone who was in the area of Tailors View, Arnold Street around this time and may have information to come forward.

"If anyone with information feels uncomfortable speaking to police I would encourage you to contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."

A scene remains in place at the address and local officers are continuing to patrol the area to provide reassurance.

If you have any information please contact Cheshire Police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously.
