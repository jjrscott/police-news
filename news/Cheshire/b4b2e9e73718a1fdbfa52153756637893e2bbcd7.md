Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a man was assaulted while walking his dog in Crewe.

At around 9pm on Saturday 28 December a 38-year-old man was walking his dog on a path off Doddington Road when a group of males approached him.

The victim, who is from the local area, was then hit and kicked by the group.

He sustained facial injuries during the incident.

The offenders then ran off in the direction of Alton Street.

One of the males has been described as white, aged around 16 to 20 and was wearing a maroon coloured padded jacket.

Detective Constable Simon Knowles, from Crewe CID, said: "This unprovoked assault has left the victim understandably shaken and we are determined to track down those responsible.

"As part of our investigation, I would like to hear from anyone who may have seen a group of young men around the time of the incident.

"Alternatively, I would like to hear from anyone who may have captured dashcam footage near the Doddington Road/Alton Street areas of Crewe around 9pm on Saturday."
