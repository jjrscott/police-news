**Police in Crewe are reassuring local residents following rumours circulating on social media.**

In recent weeks there has been a lot of rumour and speculation online following reports of an attempted child abduction at a shop on Grand Junction Way in Crewe.

The incident, which was reported to police at around 6.10pm on Friday 25 September, is alleged to have taken place on Sunday 20 September.

Officers have thoroughly investigated the allegations - this has included speaking to a number of people and examining hours of CCTV footage.

At this stage, they have not been able to find any evidence to substantiate the claims.

Following the initial incident, Crewe Local Policing Unit has become aware of rumours circulating online from other concerned parents.

Detective Constable Simon Knowles said: "I understand incidents of this nature will be concerning to local residents and I want to reiterate that we take any allegations of this nature extremely seriously.

"I would like to reassure the local community that, at this time, there is no evidence to suggest that anybody has attempted to abduct any children.

"However, should any new information come to light we would always follow this up and take action if appropriate.

"I would like to remind people that if you believe an incident of this nature is taking place you should always contact police immediately on 999.

"If you have any information, which could assist officers with their enquiries, please call 101 or report the information on our website."
