**Detectives investigating an attempted robbery at a shop in Runcorn are appealing for information.**

A man entered the shop on Waterloo Road and attempted to steal money from a member of staff inside.

He then produced a knife and made demands for the money to be handed to him.

The employee managed to disarm him and he was removed him from the shop empty handed. He then ran towards the subway at the top of Waterloo Road.

The incident took place at around 7.15pm on Tuesday 2 February.

Detective Constable Paul Cullen, from Runcorn Local Policing Unit, said: "Since the attempted robbery occurred we have been conducting a number of enquiries including CCTV opportunities and speaking to witnesses.

"These enquiries are ongoing and I am encouraging anyone who has not yet spoken to police and may have information which could assist the investigation to please get in touch.

"I also want to appeal to anyone near Waterloo Road who may have CCTV or dashcam footage that could be useful to also come forward.

"Thankfully the member of staff inside the shop at the time did not sustain any injuries but has understandably been left shaken."

If you have any information please contact Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 909215 or by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
