**The family of Peter Robson (aka Archie), aged 59, from Macclesfield - who died on Saturday 9 November - have paid tribute to him.**

Archie was taken to Macclesfield Hospital the previous night after being found with serious injuries at an address in Glegg Street.

They said: "Archie was a lovely, intelligent guy, friendly to everyone and a character people just loved. We will miss him deeply."

They have also issued a photograph of Archie, who lived in Knutsford for many years before moving to Macclesfield a year ago.
