I understand that people in Cheshire will be concerned about the Coronavirus outbreak, the impact that it may have on them and their families and how, as a community, we will get through this period of uncertainty.

Similar to other organisations, some of our staff will become ill or may be required to enter self-isolation. However, we have well developed contingency plans to ensure that we will work together with our partners, and will do everything possible to protect our communities and keep Cheshire safe.

Our dedicated PCSO's will continue to provide a visible presence in your community, and I am very grateful for the continued support that will be offered by the Special Constabulary and other volunteers.

If you do need our help, I would urge you to contact us by dialling 101 or, in cases of emergency, by dialling 999. It is possible to report incidents via our website, which I would encourage you to use when possible, as our contact centre is experiencing a higher volume in calls.

I would also urge you to look out for each other but, in particular, those who are most vulnerable. I know that Cheshire is a great county with wonderful community spirit, and we will support each other in this very difficult time.

**Darren Martland**
 **Chief Constable of Cheshire**
