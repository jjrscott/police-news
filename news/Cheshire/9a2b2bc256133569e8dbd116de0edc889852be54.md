**Detectives have released CCTV images of a man they want to speak to in connection with a knifepoint robbery at a convenience store in Ellesmere Port.**

The incident occurred at around 8.30pm on Saturday 2 January.

After entering the store on Westminster Road with a large knife in his hand and a mask covering his face, the offender threatened a man who was working behind the counter and demanded cash.

He then stole a quantity of cash from the till and fled on foot.

The offender ran off along Westminster Road in the direction of Grace Road. As he did so, he passed cars that were waiting at traffic lights to proceed onto Station Road.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing.

Detectives believe that the man in the CCTV images may have important information to aid their enquiries and are urging anyone who recognises him to get in touch.

Detective Constable Tim Cope, of Ellesmere Port CID, said: "This incident has understandably left the store worker extremely shaken up.

"We are determined to establish who committed the armed robbery and have him brought to justice.

"As part of our ongoing enquiries, we have released CCTV images of a man we believe may have vital information to help our investigation.

"If you think you recognise the man in the CCTV images or know who or where he is please call us on 101, quoting IML 887286, or give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report.

"Alternatively, you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

"The same goes for the motorists who were travelling along Westminster Road as the offender was fleeing the scene and anyone with any other information or dashcam or CCTV footage that may be relevant to our investigation into the knifepoint robbery.

"I would also like to appeal directly to the man in the CCTV images to get in touch."
