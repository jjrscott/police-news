**Detectives investigating the robbery of a teenager 's bike in Runcorn are appealing for witnesses to come forward.**

Shortly after 7pm on Monday 31 August two males approached a 13-year-old boy and his friend on Stockham Lane.

One of the men, believed to be armed with a knife, demanded the boy hand over his red bike.

The males, described as being 14-years-old, then took the bike and made off from the scene.

One of the males is described as white, 5ft 2 in height, of a skinny build with long brown or black hair.

The second is also described as white, of a skinny build and around 5ft in height. He was wearing a light grey tracksuit with a blue top as a mask.

Officers have been conducting a number of CCTV and house-to-house enquiries and are appealing for the public to come forward with information.

PC Amy Lally, of Runcorn Local Policing Unit, said: "The victim was left terrified of these two males who demanded he hand over his bike.

"While we have been following a number of lines of enquiry to find the suspects, I am appealing to anyone who may have seen them, or the bike that was stolen, to get in touch."
