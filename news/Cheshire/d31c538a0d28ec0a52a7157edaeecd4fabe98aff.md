**A 38-year-old man has been charged with driving offences following a collision in Warrington.**

Jim Loveridge, of Pringle Street, Rochdale, was arrested on Station Road, Warrington, at around 4pm on Friday 29 May.

He has since been charged with dangerous driving, failing to stop after a collision and driving without insurance.

The charges relate to a collision involving a Ford Transit van and a Hyundai i30 car at the junction of St Mary's Road and the A57 Liverpool Road in Warrington.

No-one had to go to hospital as a result of the collision, which occurred at around 3.50pm on Friday 29 May.

The junction was closed for nearly two hours as a result of the collision.

Loveridge has been released on conditional bail and is set to appear at Warrington Magistrates' Court on Thursday 2 July.
