Shortly after 10am on Thursday 2 July officers were called to reports of an incident on Gateway Trade Park, Kerfoot Street, Warrington.

Officers attended the scene and found that there had been an altercation between two men.

One of the men sustained serious injuries and was taken to Aintree Hospital. He remains in a critical but stable condition.

A 24-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of assault and has been released on conditional bail pending further enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Candice Sivori said: "I would like to reassure the local community that this appears an isolated incident.

"We have an increased police presence in the area to provide reassurance and I would urge anyone with any concerns to speak to an officer.

"While we have made an arrest we are continuing to appeal for information from the public.

"We're keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident, or anyone with any information which may assist with our investigation.

"The same goes for anyone who was driving in the area at the time of the incident and thinks they may have dashcam footage which may be relevant to the investigation."

"I'd urge anyone with any information to contact Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML-744483."
