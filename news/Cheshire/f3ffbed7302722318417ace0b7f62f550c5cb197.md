Officers are appealing for information after a windscreen of a marked police vehicle was smashed in Crewe.

At around 11.50pm on Thursday 30 April officers were dealing with a separate incident on West Street when a loud bang was heard from the direction of the vehicle.

Officers then discovered that the windscreen had been smashed.

It is believed that paving slabs were used to smash the windscreen.

Two males wearing face coverings were seen fleeing the scene in the direction of Preece Court.

Officers are now appealing for information to find those responsible.

Sergeant Paul Heatley of Crewe Local Policing Unit said: "Luckily, at the time of the incident no officers were inside the vehicle.

"At any time mindless acts of vandalism are inconceivable but given the current situation, any attack on the emergency services is hard to comprehend.

"This vehicle will now have to be taken off the road which means there is one less police vehicle patrolling the streets, keeping residents of Cheshire safe.

"Enquiries are ongoing and anyone with information which could lead us to find those responsible is urged to get in touch with us by calling 101."

Anyone with information or CCTV footage is asked to call Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 694595 or report it via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report/

Alternatively, information can be passed on to independent crime charity Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 or report it via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
