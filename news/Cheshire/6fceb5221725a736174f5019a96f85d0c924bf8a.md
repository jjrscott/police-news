**Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a robbery in Widnes.**

At around 3pm on Saturday 19 December two boys were walking through Victoria Park when two teenage males approached them.

The teenagers asked for directions before demanding a mobile phone from one of the boys.

They then fled the scene on foot towards Widnes train station.

One of the offenders is described as black, aged around 14 to 15 years-old, around 5' 9" tall and of a slim build. He was wearing a snood, black puffer style jacket and black combat pants.

The other male is white, aged around 14 to 15 years-old, around 5' 8"and of a slim build. He was wearing a snood, a blue coloured puffer jacket that was inside out and black combat pants.

Officers are now urging anyone who may have any information no matter how small to get in touch.

Detective Constable Chris Sheffield said: "Although no-one was injured during the incident, the victim was left understandably shaken.

"A number of enquiries are ongoing and patrols have been stepped up in the area.

"I would like to hear from anyone who may have seen the two offenders before or after the incident.

"The same goes for anyone who may have any dashcam or CCTV footage from the Victoria Park area at the time of the incident that they think may assist with our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to call Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 877411 or report it via the Cheshire Police website.

Information can also be passed on to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or report it via the Crimestoppers website.
