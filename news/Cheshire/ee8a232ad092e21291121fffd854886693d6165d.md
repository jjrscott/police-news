Detectives investigating an aggravated burglary in Warrington are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

Shortly after 2am on Friday 28 August three men broke into a house on Maine Gardens in Great Sankey while the occupants were asleep inside.

The men, one armed with a knife, confronted the man and woman.

The man suffered injuries to his arm believed to have been caused by the knife. He was taken to hospital by ambulance where he remains in a stable condition.

One of the men has been described as white, aged between 25-30-years-old and of a medium build. He was wearing a mask and a tracksuit.

Officers have been carrying out a number of enquiries and are appealing for information from the public.

Detective Constable Laura Gilbert, of Warrington CID, said: "This was a terrifying incident and we have been following a number of lines of enquiry to establish what has taken place.

"The incident occurred in the early hours of the morning and I am encouraging anyone who saw or heard anything to come forward.

"If you have any dashcam or CCTV footage which could assist our investigation please send it through to us."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 791269.

Information can also be provided anonymously by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
