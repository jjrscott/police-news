**Detectives are appealing for information from members of the public after a boy had his bicycle stolen in a robbery in Runcorn.**

The victim, a 12-year-old from the town, was riding his lime green mountain bike along Heath Road when the incident occurred near the junction with Boston Avenue at around 5pm on Sunday 11 October.

An unknown man approached the boy from behind and pushed him off the bike onto the floor, causing minor injuries to the victim.

The offender then rode off on the bike into the Town Hall park.

He was white and looked to be in his mid to late 20s and around 6' 4" tall.

The offender had a slim build and brown eyes and was wearing a black hooded zip-up top with the hood up, dark grey tracksuit bottoms, black trainers and a black face mask.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone with any information or footage regarding the robbery to get in touch.

Detective Constable Nathaniel Walkowiak, of Runcorn Local Policing Unit, said: "The young victim has understandably been left upset and shaken up by this frightening incident.

"Thankfully he has his bike back. We found it at a well-known abandoned house in Irwell lane, Runcorn, around 25 minutes after the robbery took place.

"I would like to reassure members of the community that the fact the stolen bike has been recovered in no way diminishes our determination to establish who committed the robbery and make him face the consequences of his actions.

"Enquiries are ongoing and I urge anyone who was in the area and saw anything that may aid our investigation to contact us at Runcorn Police Station.

"The same goes for anyone who thinks they may know who the offender is, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of him."

Anyone with information or footage that may help the investigation is asked to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 825523, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
