As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 situation new guidance has been issued in relation to police bail.

From today (Thursday 26 March) all suspects who are due to answer police bail at one of Cheshire's three custody suites are required to telephone 24-hours before their scheduled appointment.

They will then be provided with the relevant advice and guidance in relation to their bail to help avoid any unnecessary contact where possible.

Below are the telephone numbers for the Cheshire Constabulary custody suites:

 * Chester (Western Custody): 01606 366270
 * Middlewich (Eastern Custody): 01606 366370
 * Runcorn (Northern Custody): 01606 366470

All suspects are requested to have their custody reference number ready when calling.

Superintendent Julie Westgate said: "These changes have been put in place to help minimise any unnecessary contact wherever possible, helping to protect both the public and our officers and staff."
