**Detectives investigating an attempted robbery in the Halton Brook area of Runcorn are appealing for information from members of the public.**

The victim, a local woman in her 20s, was walking her dog towards Halton Brook Park from the direction of the Penfolds estate when the incident occurred at around 11.20pm on Sunday 7 June.

After speaking to the woman, a group of five men tried to steal her dog, grabbing her wrist and attempting to take the lead out of her hand.

She struck one of the offenders, who were disturbed by a member of the public walking in the area.

The victim then walked away with her dog.

The offenders looked around 25 to 30 years old. They were all wearing jogging bottoms and hooded tops, with their hoods up, and they all spoke with local accents.

One of them had black hair and a small beard and another had quite long blondish hair.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone who was in the area and saw anything that may help their investigation to come forward.

They also want to speak to anyone who believes they may know who the offenders are, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of them.

Detective Constable Dan Williams, of Runcorn CID, said: "This was a frightening incident that has understandably left the victim shaken up.

"I would like to reassure residents that this is believed to be an isolated incident and we are determined to establish the identities of the offenders and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"Enquiries are ongoing and as part of our investigation we want to speak to anyone who was in the area that night and believes they may have seen the offenders.

"We particularly want to talk to the man who disturbed them as they were trying to steal the victim's dog.

"We also want to hear from anyone who believes they may know who the offenders are, or have footage of them."

Anyone with information or CCTV or dashcam footage that could aid the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 725080, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
