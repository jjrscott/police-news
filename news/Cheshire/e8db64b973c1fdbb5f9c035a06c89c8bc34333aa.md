**Detectives investigating a robbery incident at a convenience store in Widnes are appealing for information and footage from members of the public.**

At around 10.10pm on Monday 17 February a man wearing a balaclava walked into the Hough Green store on Ditchfield Road brandishing a knife and demanding that staff open the till.

One of the team armed himself with a baseball bat and managed to fend off the offender.

The offender fled empty-handed, going towards the Hammer and Pincers pub on foot.

He had walked to the convenience store from the same direction.

The offender is described as around 5' 7" tall. He was wearing a light grey balaclava, a blue/grey Puffer-style hooded coat, black bottoms and black gloves.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone with any information or footage regarding the offender to come forward.

Detective Sergeant Henderson Pierre, of Widnes Local Policing Unit, said: "Thankfully no-one was injured as a result of this incident and nothing was stolen from the convenience store.

"However, it was a terrifying incident for those who were in the store at the time the attempted robbery took place.

"We are determined to establish the identity of the offender and make him face the consequences of his actions.

"Enquiries are ongoing and as part of our investigation we want to speak to anyone who was in the area and witnessed anything that may be relevant.

"We also want to hear from anyone who believes they may know who the offender is, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of him."

Anyone with information or footage that may help the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 639939, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
