A serving police officer is marking his 30th birthday in a unique way - by undertaking 30 different challenges for charity.

Chester PC Steffan Cooling started his challenges in May 2019 when he completed the Chester Half Marathon.

Since then he has completed 28 other challenges, including a Cheshire 100k cycle ride and the Denbigh Sprint Triathlon.

He has even learnt sign language and how to surf!

Steffan is set to complete his final challenge this weekend, when he takes part in a 10,000ft tandem skydive.

All of the money raised will be donated to the Marie Curie cancer charity.

Steffan said: "As I approached my 30th birthday I decided that I wanted to do something different and something to really push and challenge myself.

"That's why I decided to undertake my 30 different challenges, ranging from charity bake sales, marathons and even Dry January.

"So far the response has been fantastic and I approach the final challenge this weekend, a 10,000ft skydive, really keen to complete it and help raise Â£1,000 for the Marie Curie charity.

"Having lost my mum to cancer a couple of years ago, I saw what great work the charity does.

"It's a charity which is close to my heart."
