_Officers are appealing for assistance from the public following a police pursuit in Wilmslow._

_ _

_At approximately 2pm on Sunday 12 January officers attempted to stop a silver Honda Civic on the A538 Prestbury Road, near Wilmslow._

_ _

_The vehicle failed to stop so officers followed the vehicle as it travelled into Wilmslow._

_ _

_The vehicle was subsequently abandoned on Hawthorn Avenue and two men fled the scene on foot._

_ _

_The police helicopter was called to the scene and two men, aged 27 and 28, were subsequently located in the Stanneylands area and arrested on suspicion of burglary and going equipped for theft._

_ _

_The 27-year-old was also arrested on suspicion of drug driving._

_ _

_The pair, who are both from the Manchester area, have since been released under investigation pending further enquiries._

_ _

_Officers believe that a number of items may have been discarded by the suspects as they fled the scene and they are now appealing to the public to help locate them._

_ _

_Inspector Duncan Gouck said: "This investigation is ongoing and we're currently following a number of lines of enquiry._

_ _

_" From our initial investigation we believe that a number of items may have been discarded by the suspects as they fled the scene and we're keen to locate them._

_ _

_" We believe that the items, which include a pair of Nike trainers, may have been discarded in the Carrs or Stanneylands areas and we would urge anyone who finds anything suspicious or unusual in the area to get in touch."_

_ _

_Anyone with any information which may aid the investigation is asked to call Cheshire Police, on 101 quoting IML 650522 or visithttps://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/. Information can also be passed anonymously, via Crimestoppers, on 0800 555 111._
