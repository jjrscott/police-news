Police are appealing for witnesses following an aggravated burglary in Weaverham.

Around 7.40pm on Friday 19th March a man has entered an address in Walnut Avenue and demanded keys to the car on the driveway. The man threatened the victim with what is believed to be an air pistol. The victim and his partner managed to remove the offender from the premises and call police.

Following the incident a search was made of the area, but the suspect was not located and enquires have been continuing to trace him.

DC James Elliott said: "This was obviously a shocking ordeal for the couple but they thankfully weren't injured during the incident. I'd like to reassure residents that we have been making numerous enquiries in order to identify the suspect and are maintaining a presence in the area.

"I'd like to take the opportunity to remind people to lock their doors and keep valuables out of sight - report any suspicious activity to police and review your CCTV if you have it.

"We're particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have doorbell or CCTV footage of any suspicious activity in the Weaverham area between 7pm and 8pm , so I'd urge you to check cameras between those times that evening."

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 or via the website quoting IML 942524.

Alternatively information can be passed anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
