**Officers are appealing for information and footage from members of the public after a teenage boy had his bicycle stolen in a robbery in Widnes.**

The victim, a 13-year-old from the town, was riding his black and blue Norco mountain bike along Sandy Lane when the incident occurred at around 6.30pm on Saturday 8 August.

An unknown male approached the boy from behind, threatened him and demanded the bike.

The offender then rode off on the bike towards Old Upton Lane before turning in the direction of Queensbury Way.

He was white and looked to be around 17 to 20 years old and approximately 6' 2" tall.

The offender had a slim build, thick stubble on the sides of his face and spoke with a Liverpudlian accent.

He was wearing a black hoodie with grey arms, black shorts and black trainers.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and officers are urging anyone with any information or footage regarding the robbery, the offender or the whereabouts of the stolen mountain bike to get in touch.

Police Constable Danielle Howcroft, of Widnes Local Policing Unit, said: "The young victim has understandably been left shaken up by this frightening incident.

"I would like to reassure members of the community that we are determined to establish who committed the robbery, make him face the consequences of his actions and have the stolen mountain bike returned to its rightful owner.

"Enquiries are ongoing and I urge anyone who was in the area and saw anything that may help our investigation to contact us at Widnes Police Station.

"The same goes for anyone who thinks they may know who the offender is, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of him.

"We also want to speak to anyone who believes they may have seen the stolen mountain bike since the robbery took place, or have information regarding its whereabouts."

Anyone with information or footage that may aid the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 775112, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
