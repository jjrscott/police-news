Police investigating a burglary at a shop in Macclesfield are appealing for information from the public.

At some time during the night of Sunday 24 November into the early hours of Monday 25 November burglars have broken into The Works on Mill Street and believed to have entered through the roof.

Once inside the offenders have used a power tool to gain access to the safe and steal a large quantity of money before leaving the shop through the back door.

PC Mike Davis, from Macclesfield Local Policing Unit, said: "I am appealing for anyone who may have seen people acting suspiciously around this area or have information which could help the investigation, to get in touch.

"I am also keen to see if anyone noticed any vehicles near to the shop to come forward. If you have dashcam footage please submit it through to us."
