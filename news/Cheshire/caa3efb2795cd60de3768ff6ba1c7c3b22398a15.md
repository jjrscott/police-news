**Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a serious collision in Nether Alderley.**

At around 8.15pm on Saturday 30 January, police were called to a collision on the A34 Alderley Edge by-pass.

The collision involved a silver Honda Civic that was travelling towards Macclesfield and a grey Nissan Micra travelling towards Wilmslow.

The driver of the Nissan Micra, a 32-year-old man, was taken to hospital with serious injuries. His condition is described as critical.

A 23-year-old man, the driver of the Honda Civic, was taken to hospital with serious injuries. He has since been discharged.

Officers are now appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the collision to come forward.

The same goes for any dashcam footage which may have captured the vehicles before the incident or the collision itself.

Anyone with information is asked to call Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 906952 or report it via the Cheshire Police website.

Alternatively, information can be passed anonymously via Crimestoppers by calling 0800 555 111 or via the Crimestoppers website.
