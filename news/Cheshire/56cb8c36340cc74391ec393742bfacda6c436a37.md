**A 59-year-old man has been charged in relation to an allegation that a woman in her 70s paid a large amount of money for work that was not completed at her home.**

Alexander 'Sandy' Emslie, who lives at an address off Rawson Road in Blacon, Chester, was arrested on Thursday 12 November.

He was released on police bail whilst further enquiries were carried out.

Those enquiries culminated in Emslie being charged with fraud by false representation on Tuesday 19 January.

The charge relates to money allegedly paid out by the woman from the Christleton area of Chester between July and August.

Emslie has been released on conditional bail and is set to appear at Chester Magistrates' Court on Friday 19 February.
