A drug dealer from Oldham has been jailed after he was caught hiding crack cocaine inside a box of jalapenos.

Kayne Kennedy was leaving a cafe on Orford Lane in Warrington on the morning of Tuesday 23 April when he was stopped by two officers.

The 20-year-old, of Whitland Drive, suddenly attempted to run away to evade being detained.

However when this failed he threw the box of jalapenos he was holding on to the floor.

Within the contents of the box were 36 individual wraps of crack cocaine worth a total of Â£360.

Kennedy was seen on CCTV purchasing the jalapenos from the cafe and holding the box as he left in the direction of the officers.

Kennedy is believed to have been a drugs runner for a county lines organised crime group (OCG).

A term used to describe an OCG who use a mobile phone, known as a 'line' or a 'graft' to extend their criminal activity into new locations - usually from a city into rural areas.

Detective Sergeant Tom Hall said: "Kennedy is a very nasty criminal who would transport crack cocaine from Oldham to be supplied in Warrington.

"We are fully aware of criminals like him who come into our town with the sole purpose of supplying class A drugs and we are taking positive action to disrupt their activity.

"I want to take this opportunity to encourage residents to keep spotting the signs of drug activity and to come forward to report it if they believe it is happening in their community."

Kennedy was sentenced to 30 months at Liverpool Crown Court on Friday 17 April after pleading guilty to possession with intent to supply cocaine.
