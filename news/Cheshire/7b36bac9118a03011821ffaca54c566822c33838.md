Officers investigating a fatal collision in Orford are further appealing for witnesses to come forward.

The one-vehicle-collision on Statham Avenue involved a Kawasaki motorcycle with a rider and pillion passenger.

It was reported to police at around 6.11pm on Sunday 19 April.

Two men were taken to Aintree Hospital.

One of the men, Leon Cameron, aged 28, sadly died a short time later.

The other 28-year-old man remains in hospital.

Following a number of enquiries, officers have established two witnesses were at the scene who have not yet come forward to speak to police.

They are directly appealing for the man and woman, who were walking along Statham Avenue with a child at the time, to get in touch.

The man was dressed in dark clothing with a black puffer jacket and the woman was wearing a yellow coat.

Sergeant Helen Cooper, from the Serious and Complex Investigation Unit, said: "Sadly a young man died in the collision and our thoughts are with his family who are being supported during this difficult time.

"Our enquiries have been ongoing and I have established a number of witnesses were in the area when the collision took place.

"I am particularly keen to speak to a man and woman who were walking together on Statham Road when the collision occurred. I want to make it clear that we want to speak to them purely as witnesses as they may be able to help with our investigation.

"I also want to encourage anyone else who has not yet spoken to police and may have information or dashcam footage to get in touch."
