Officers have launched an investigation after a man died following a collision on the A556 in Tabley.

At around 9.30am on Monday 6 January a grey Audi, which was driving towards Manchester, was involved in a collision with a HGV, which was travelling in the opposite direction.

The HGV also collided with a house at the side of the road.

Sadly, the driver of the car was pronounced dead at the scene.

Formal identification of the man has not yet taken place. However, he is believed to be a 56-year-old man from the Sandbach area. His next of kin have been informed.

The driver of the HGV, a 53-year-old man from Kirkbride, sustained minor injuries and was taken to hospital as a precaution. He has since been discharged.

There was minor damage to the house and nobody inside was injured.

Enquiries are ongoing and officers are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision or anyone with any dashcam footage which may aid their investigation.

Anyone who witnessed the collision, or anyone with any information that may assist the investigation, is asked to contact Cheshire Police on 101, quoting IML 605662 or visit https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/ .
