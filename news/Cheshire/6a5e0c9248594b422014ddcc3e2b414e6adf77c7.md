A young man has been charged with murder and possession of a bladed article following the death of a man in Ellesmere Port.

Arkadiusz Kaczmarek, aged 22, of Blakemere Court, has been remanded into custody and is due to appear at Warrington Magistrates' Court via video link on Tuesday 5 May.

At around 3.15am on Saturday 2 May officers attended an address at Blakemere Court after concerns were raised for the welfare of a person at the property.

Once inside, they discovered the victim - believed to be Slawomir Kulesza, aged 47, from Ellesmere Port - with serious injuries.

The officers administered first aid and paramedics were called to the address to assist but, despite the best efforts of everyone involved, he sadly died at the scene.

Kaczmarek was arrested on Saturday 2 May and subsequently charged on the evening of Monday 4 May.
