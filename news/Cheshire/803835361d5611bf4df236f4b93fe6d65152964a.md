**Detectives are appealing for information and footage from members of the public following an arson attack in Ellesmere Port.**

At around 10.20pm on Tuesday 22 September firefighters were informed of a parked car being on fire in Smithy Lane, Little Sutton, Ellesmere Port.

The blaze caused extensive damage to the orange Peugeot 2008 before being extinguished by firefighters.

The fire is believed to have been started deliberately.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone with any information or footage that may aid their investigation to get in touch.

Detective Constable Iain Ross, of Ellesmere Port CID, said: "Fire spreads quickly and can put lives as well as properties and possessions in danger.

"The car was parked near to a building, but thankfully firefighters were able to extinguish the fire before it had chance to spread beyond the vehicle.

"The car sustained extensive fire damage but no-one was injured as a result of the blaze. The consequences of this incident could have been far worse.

"I would like to reassure members of the community that this is believed to be an isolated incident and we are determined to establish who started the fire and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"As part of our ongoing enquiries we want to speak to anyone who was in the area and believes they may have seen something that could help our investigation.

"We also want to hear from anyone who thinks they may know who started the fire, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of them."

Anyone with information or footage that may be relevant to the investigation is asked to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 811562, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
