**Detectives investigating an attempted robbery in Crewe are appealing for information.**

At 3.50pm on Tuesday 23 February a 44-year-old man was riding his pedal bike along Hope Street when he was approached by two men as he reached the alleyway.

One of the men, armed with a hammer, pulled at the victim's coat and hit him on the face and arm. The other man, armed with a large knife, pulled at the bike and caused injuries to the victim's head.

The victim managed to leave the scene with his bike and report it to police.

The injuries sustained by the weapons required hospital treatment.

One of the men is described as white, aged in his late teens, of a skinny build and around 5'4" and was wearing dark clothing.

The second man is described as being of mixed heritage, aged between 18-22, of a medium build and approximately 5'8 and was wearing dark clothing.

Enquiries have been ongoing and officers appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident or has CCTV or dash cam footage to get in touch.

Detective Constable John Horsham, from Crewe Local Policing Unit, said: "This was a terrifying attack which has understandably left the victim shaken.

"Since it was reported to police we have been carrying out a number of enquiries and are appealing to the public to come forward with information.

"Please get in touch if you witnessed the incident, believe you saw the men involved or if you have CCTV or dash cam footage which could assist the investigation."

If you have information, dash cam or CCTV footage please contact Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 924026.
