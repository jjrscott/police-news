**A former member of Cheshire Police staff has been jailed after pleading guilty to a number of offences.**

Bryn Majid, a former custody investigation officer, was sentenced to 20 months in prison at Liverpool Crown Court on Friday 23 October.

The 59-year-old, of Hale Road, Widnes, admitted attempting to engage in sexual activity with a child and three counts of downloading images.

He was also ordered to sign the sex offenders register for 10 years.

Following his sentencing, Detective Superintendent Chris Warren, of Cheshire Constabulary's Professional Standards Department, said: "As a former police staff member working in the role of custody investigator he knew that what he was doing was against the law. He held a position of trust and he agreed to abide by the clear guidelines about the standards expected of him.

"Disappointingly, as this conviction shows, his behaviour was totally inappropriate and he clearly failed to meet these standards.

"While Majid pleaded guilty and resigned from the force, that does not in any way excuse his behaviour and I hope that the outcome of this case reassures the public by demonstrating that nobody is above the law, no matter what position they hold."
