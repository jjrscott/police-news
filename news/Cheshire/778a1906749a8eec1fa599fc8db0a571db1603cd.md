A 19-year-old man who was caught discarding crack cocaine down a toilet has been jailed.

Liam Malvern, from Dam Wood Road in Liverpool, was caught by officers after they raided a house on Watkin Street in Orford on Thursday 24 October 2019.

On entering the house, officers saw Malvern sat on the toilet with his trousers by his ankles.

They believed he had been disposing of drugs while they gained entry to the house.

Malvern was swiftly handcuffed and following a search almost Â£200 was recovered from his trouser pocket.

Police also seized two mobile phones, a debt list found on the kitchen worktop with handwritten names and amounts on and two train tickets.

After examining the mobile phones officers uncovered Malvern had been visiting the address on a regular basis and offering drugs to users.

Malvern was sentenced to three years and six months at Liverpool Crown Court on Monday 23 March after pleading guilty to being concerned in the supply of crack cocaine.

Detective Sergeant Tom Hall, from Warrington Beat Initiative Team, said: "Malvern had only just been released from prison after admitting supplying heroin and crack cocaine when he was caught once again by my team.

"He thought he could flush away the drugs and no police action would be taken, however he has learnt it isn't as easy as that.

"We conduct thorough searches of the property and seize numerous items which provide vital evidence in uncovering the extent of the drug activity.

"Malvern was shown to be a regular visitor of the address and dealing crack cocaine to users - there's only one place for this type of activity - and that's prison."

If you believe drug activity is taking place in your community please report it to Cheshire Police either by visiting the website https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ or calling 101.
