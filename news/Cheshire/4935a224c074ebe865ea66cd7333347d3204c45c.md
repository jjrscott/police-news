**A man from Warrington has been charged with drug offences after a car and two houses were searched by officers in the town.**

Danny Lockey, of Willoughby Close, was arrested in Reaper Close, Great Sankey, Warrington, shortly after 11.30pm on Wednesday 15 January.

The 35-year-old has subsequently been charged with possession with intent to supply class A drug cocaine and class B drug cannabis.

He has also been charged with resisting arrest.

The charges relate to an incident in Reaper Close in which a car was searched.

Two houses in Warrington were also subsequently searched.

Officers seized quantities of what are believed to be illegal drugs during the searches.

Lockey appeared at Warrington Magistrates' Court on Friday 17 January.

He has been remanded in custody and is set to appear at Liverpool Crown Court on Friday 14 February.

Two 37-year-old women from Warrington were also arrested in relation to the incident in Reaper Close.

They have since been released under investigation pending further enquiries.
