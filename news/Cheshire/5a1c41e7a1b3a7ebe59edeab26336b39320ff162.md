A Chester man has been sentenced to four years behind bars after pleading guilty to Section 20 wounding.

Ricky Jones, 30, from Earls Port in Chester, was sentenced on Wednesday 15 January after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing.

Chester Crown Court heard that at around 9.35pm on 19 April a man was speaking to people outside the Wagon and Horses in Western Avenue, Blacon, when a car drove onto the car park.

Ricky Jones, who was a passenger in the car, got out and attacked the victim with a knife resulting in a serious injury to his neck. Jones then chased the victim into the pub before fleeing the scene in the car. The victim had to be taken to hospital to be treated.

Jones was also sentenced for two other offences - an assault on a police officer and possession of a knife, for which he will serve six months before beginning his sentence for the wounding - he will serve a total of four years in custody and one year on licence.

Judge Everett also handed Jones a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) for an unlimited time.

The conditions of the CBO state that Jones cannot enter a public house in the Cheshire West and Chester area and he is excluded from the Blacon area.

DC Andy Manson said: "Jones went to the pub with the intention of causing his victim harm.

"He meted out a violent attack with a knife outside a busy pub and even chased the victim into the pub causing great distress to those who had to witness this level of violence.

"This result reinforces the fact that we will pursue those who use violence and carry weapons and ensure that they face the consequences of their actions."
