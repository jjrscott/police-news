**Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an arson incident in Macclesfield.**

Between 3.30am and 4.15am on Thursday 5 December a van was set alight at the Crown Centre industrial estate in Bond Street.

The fire spread to another van next to the vehicle.

Firefighters extinguished the fire before it had chance to spread any further.

The fire caused extensive damage to the two vans, a white Ford Transit and a silver Mercedes-Benz Sprinter.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and officers are urging anyone with any information that may help their investigation to get in touch.

Sergeant Gareth Renshaw, of Macclesfield Local Policing Unit, said: "The vans were close to a commercial building in the industrial estate.

"Thankfully the fire did not spread to the building and no-one was injured as a result of the fire.

"The consequences of this incident could have been much more serious and we are determined to establish who started the fire and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"Enquiries are ongoing and as part of our investigation we want to hear from anyone who was in the area and witnessed anything that may be relevant.

"Perhaps you saw the fire being started or witnessed something suspicious.

"If you have any information regarding the fire or the person, or persons, who started it please contact the team here at Macclesfield Police Station."

Anyone with information that may be relevant to the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 581011, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
