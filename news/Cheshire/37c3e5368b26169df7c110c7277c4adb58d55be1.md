**Detectives investigating a firearms discharge in Crewe are urging people to come forward with information.**

At around 2am Wednesday 4 November a man is believed to have approached a group of people in an alleyway at the rear of Brooklyn Street and Nelson Street and a shot was fired.

A 23-year-old man received an injury to his arm that is not believed to be life threatening. He did not immediately attend hospital at the time however received treatment later the same day and has since been released.

An investigation is now underway to establish the full circumstances.

Officers from the local policing unit - supported by armed officers - are currently at the scene conducting a number of enquiries. At this stage no arrests have been made.

Detective Inspector Claire Jesson, from Crewe Local Policing Unit, said: "I appreciate this is a concerning incident for those living in the local area. I want to reassure residents that we are doing everything we can to piece together what has happened and at this stage I do not believe it to be a random attack.

"The investigation is in its early stages and I need the help and support of the local community to provide any information they may have - even the smallest piece can be useful.

"You can expect to see a large policing presence while we do everything we can to trace those responsible with officers patrolling the area and anyone with any concerns is urged to speak to them.

"If you do not feel comfortable speaking to police directly please contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
