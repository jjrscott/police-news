Detectives are appealing for information after a burglary at a newsagents in Northwich.

Sometime between 9.15pm on Tuesday 28 April and 5am on Wednesday 29 April, unknown offenders are believed to have broken in to a newsagents on Mere Lane in Sandiway.

It is thought that the offenders had managed to gain access through the back of the shop.

A quantity of cash was taken from an ATM machine inside along with takings.

Alcohol and cigarettes are also believed to have been stolen.

Officers are now appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

Detective Constable Andrea Ellis of Northwich CID said: "While we're in the early stages of the investigation, we are following several lines of enquiry and are doing everything we can to bring the offenders to justice.

"Burglary is a serious offence and in this case, has left a shop owner without hard-earned takings and stock.

"I am keen to hear from anyone who may have information on those responsible for this burglary or may have CCTV footage from the vicinity of the shop.

"Anyone with any information, no matter how big or small, is asked to contact Cheshire Police on 101 or via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report/ ."

Anyone with information is asked to call Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 693320 or report it via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report/
