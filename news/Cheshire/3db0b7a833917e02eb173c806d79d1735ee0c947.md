**Police are appealing for witnesses following an indecent exposure in Congleton.**

At about 7.45am on Thursday 31 October a woman was walking along Sefton Avenue in Congleton when she passed a small old white van, smaller than a transit.

The man has said something to her and when she turned toward him, she saw that he was wearing nothing on his bottom half and was exposing himself.

The man had white hair and is aged between 50 and 60 years old.

PC Paul Fisher said: "I would urge anyone who does see this type of behaviour to report it immediately so that we can find the person responsible and take action.

"If you saw anyone acting suspiciously in the area on the morning 31 October please contact us on 101."

If you have any information contact Cheshire Police on 101 or via https://www.cheshire.police.uk quoting IML 552940.

Alternatively information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
