**Detectives investigating a motorbike set on fire in Runcorn are appealing for witnesses to come forward.**

At around 12.25am on Monday 21 September police found a motorbike and a car ablaze on Parker Street.

The fire had quickly spread to a house nearby causing damage.

A number of people inside the property were safely evacuated as a precaution and the fire was extinguished by firefighters.

Enquiries in relation to the fire are ongoing and it is being treated as arson.

Detectives are appealing to the public to come forward with information and if they saw anyone acting suspiciously in the area surrounding Parker Street and the Old Town prior to the fire.

Detective Constable Paul Cullen, of Runcorn CID said: "The blaze caused significant damage to the motorbike and a house close by and we believe it was started deliberately.

"A number of people were evacuated as a precaution and the consequences could have been far worse if they had not become aware of the fire.

"We have been following a number of lines of enquiry and are determined to identify those responsible and ensure they face the full consequences of their actions.

"I would encourage anyone with information to please get in touch with us."
