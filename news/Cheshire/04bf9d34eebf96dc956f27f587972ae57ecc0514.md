Police are appealing for information after a keyworker was assaulted in Ellesmere Port.

At approximately 6.30pm on Thursday 2 April a woman was getting out of her car on Westminster Road when she was approached by a group of teenagers.

They made a number of abusive comments to her, kicked her car and one youth spat at her clothing.

The males are described as being between 13 and 18-years-old, spoke with local accents and were wearing dark clothing with scarves around their faces. Some of the youths were riding bikes.
The teenagers left the area via a nearby alleyway.

PC Chris Francis, from Ellesmere Port Local Policing Unit, said: "I struggle to comprehend such disgraceful and completely unacceptable behaviour during what is a challenging and difficult time for us all.

"Since the assault we have been carrying out a number of enquiries and reviewing CCTV footage.

"I would like to appeal to anyone who has any information about what happened to come forward. I'd also like to hear from anyone who lives locally and has any CCTV or dashcam footage around this particular time.

"I also want to take this opportunity to remind everyone to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives."
