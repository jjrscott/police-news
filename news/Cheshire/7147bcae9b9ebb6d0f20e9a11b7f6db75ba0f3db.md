**Officers are appealing for witnesses and footage following a fatal hit-and-run collision in Crewe.**

At around 6.55am on Monday 14 September police were informed of a collision on Hungerford Road near to Hungerford Terrace.

On arrival officers discovered that a cyclist had been involved in a collision with a car, which had fled the scene.

The cyclist, a 41-year-old local woman, sustained serious injuries and was taken to Leighton Hospital via ambulance.

Sadly, she has since died. Her next of kin have been informed and they are being supported by specialist officers.

The vehicle has been described as a silver saloon car which drove off in the direction of the M6.

The car is believed to have sustained serious damage to the front bumper area.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and anyone who witnessed the collision is asked to get in touch.

The same goes for anyone with any dashcam or CCTV footage which may aid the investigation.

Sergeant Helen Cooper said: "We are in the early stages of the investigation and enquiries are very much ongoing.

"Hungerford Road would have been particularly busy during the time of the collision and we would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident or anything else that may help our investigation.

"We are also keen to hear from anyone believes they have dashcam footage of the collision, or of the vehicle involved in the incident."

Anyone with information or footage that may be relevant to the investigation is asked to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 804595, or give the details via our website.

A 20-year-old man from Stoke-on-Trent and an 18-year-old woman from Trent Vale, have been arrested in connection with the incident. They are currently assisting officers with their enquiries.
