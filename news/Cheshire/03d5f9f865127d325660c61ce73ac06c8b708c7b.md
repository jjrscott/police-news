Detectives are appealing for information from the public following a serious assault in Crewe.

Shortly after 12pm today, Thursday 8 October, police were called to reports that a man had been assaulted at an address on Pedley Street.

Officers attended the scene and found that a 44-year-old man had sustained stab wounds.

He has been taken to the Royal Stoke Hospital where his condition is described as critical.

A 47-year-old local woman has been arrested on suspicion of Section 18 assault in connection with the incident. She is currently being held in police custody.

Detective Inspector Claire Jesson said: "This investigation is in its early stages and we are doing all that we can to establish exactly what had taken place.

"As part of our enquiries I am keen to hear from anyone who witnessed anything suspicious in the area at the time of the incident.

"The same goes for anyone who was driving at the time and may have any dashcam footage which could aid our investigation."

Anyone with information or dashcam footage that may help the investigation is asked to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 822881, or give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report.
