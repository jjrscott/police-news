Police in Chester Local Policing Unit are advising residents to increase the security of their sheds and valuables following a number of incidents in the area.

Officers are currently investigating three shed breaks in Top Road and Church Road Frodsham, one in Furne Road, Chester and one in Chester Road, Kelsall between 28 and 29 November.

In some cases nothing was taken and in others, power tools, quad bikes and a metal detector were taken.

Inspector Nick Henderson said: "While we continue to investigate these burglaries we would urge residents to think about their security and review how they can improve it.

"In some instances, the locks were forced in order to break into the sheds so if you do have valuable such as bikes or quad bikes in outbuildings or sheds you may want to think about extra ways to secure them - and with Christmas round the corner, it's particularly important not to give thieves the chance. You can help us make it difficult for thieves by following a number of steps and denying them the opportunity to steal your hard earned property.

"I'd like to reassure you that as well as making a number enquiries in the area to find those responsible, we've also increased patrols to deter thieves. By working together we can make Chester LPU a no go area for those who commit crime."

Tips on preventing shed or outbuilding burglaries:
• Check outbuildings, sheds and garages are locked and secure
• Keep windows shut when unoccupied
• Keep personal items such as bikes and gardening tools stored away and out of sight
• Invest in strong padlocks to fit to sheds and/or garages or have them fitted with an alarm
• CCTV is also an option to consider, or security lights which come on when someone walks toward it
• Look out for yourself and neighbours by reporting suspicious activity to police.
