Detectives from Northwich CID have charged two men in connection with a serious assault at an address in Greenbank.

Daniel Cook, aged 28, and 31-year-old Shaun Yardley, were both arrested on Saturday 29 February following an incident outside an address on Hatton Lane at around 8pm.

The victim, a 50-year-old local man, sustained a number of injuries and was taken to Leighton Hospital; his injuries are not believed to be life threatening.

Cook, of Bowfell Close, Davenham, and Yardley, of Walnut Avenue, Weaverham, have both since been charged with Section 18 assault and possession of a knife/bladed article in a public place.

The pair have been remanded into custody and are set to appear at Chester Magistrates' Court on Monday 2 March.
