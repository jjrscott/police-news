**Detectives investigating a burglary in Castle have released a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to.**

At around 3am on Wednesday 6 November the occupants of an address on Beeston Street were awoken by the sound of footsteps in their hallway.

The owner of the address, a 25-year-old man, got out of bed and went downstairs to investigate where he discovered an unknown man in his hallway.

The offender was carrying a small black or brown bulldog under his arm.

The victim shouted at the offender, who quickly exited the address via the front door, turning left towards Chester Road.

After the man had left the occupants discovered that no items had been stolen from their home, but the offender had conducted a search of the address.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and officers believe that the man in the CCTV image may have vital information to aid their investigation.

They are urging anyone who recognises him or thinks they may know who he is to get in touch.
Detective Constable Chris Palmer, from Northwich Beat Team, said: "Thankfully on this occasion the offender was disturbed before anything was taken.

"However, burglary is a serious offence and we are committed to doing all we can to trace the offender in this case.

"As part of our enquiries we are keen to speak to the man in the CCTV image to help with our ongoing investigation.

"If you think you recognise the man in the CCTV image or know who he is please call us on 101, quoting IML 558360, or give us the details online at www.cheshire.police.uk .

"I would also like to appeal directly to the man in the CCTV image to get in touch."

Information can also be reported anonymously, via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
