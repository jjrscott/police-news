**Officers are appealing for information from members of the public following a burglary incident at a church in Chester.**

Between 6pm on Saturday 21 March and 9.45am on Sunday 22 March the Church of the Holy Trinity in Capenhurst was broken into.

No-one was inside the church at the time.

After removing a window from the church in Capenhurst Lane, the offender or offenders conduced an untidy search of the premises.

They are not believed to have stolen anything from the church.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and officers are urging anyone with any information or footage that may help their investigation to come forward.

Police Constable Ashley Davies, of Chester Local Policing Unit, said:

"All burglary offences are serious, but to target a place of worship is despicable.

"We are determined to establish who broke into the church and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"As part of our ongoing enquiries we are appealing for anyone with information or footage that may be relevant to the investigation to get in touch.

"Perhaps you were in the area that Saturday evening or Sunday morning and witnessed something suspicious.

"Or maybe you believe that you may know who committed the offence, or have dashcam footage of them."

Anyone with any information or footage that may aid the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 666217, or give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report.

Alternatively, information can be reported to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously.
