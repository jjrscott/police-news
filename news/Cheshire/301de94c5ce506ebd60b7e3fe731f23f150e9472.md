Four people have been arrested for drugs offences following a series of dawn raids in Ellesmere Port.

Earlier today, Thursday 7 May, officers executed warrants at three addresses on Westminster Road, Cavell Drive and Mallory Road.

Three men, aged 18, 27 and 36, and a 37-year-old women were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs. They are all in custody helping officers with their enquiries.

Officers also seized a quantity of what is believed to be Class A and Class B drugs.

Sergeant Jon Wilson, of Ellesmere Port Beat Management Team, said: "I welcome today's arrests and I hope that they provide reassurance to our communities that we are committed to doing all we can to tackle this type of criminality.

"Drugs have a hugely detrimental impact on communities, causing widespread misery. As such, cutting off supplies of illegal drugs and removing drug dealers from our communities is of paramount importance.

"We need the public to be our eyes and ears and to come forward with information regarding drug dealing in their communities.

"Your support is crucial in the ongoing fight against illegal drug dealing and all other forms of serious and organised crime.

"Together we can help to keep vulnerable people and our communities safe.

"Suspected drug dealing activity can be reported directly to the team here at Ellesmere Port by calling 101.

"Alternatively, if you do not feel comfortable speaking to a police officer then you can give information anonymously by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
