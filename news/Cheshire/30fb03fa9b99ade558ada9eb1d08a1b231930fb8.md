Officers have released CCTV footage following what is believed to have been an attempted burglary in Betchton.

At around 5.40pm on Wednesday 8 January two men wearing face coverings drove up to a secure storage compound in Cappers Lane.

One of them got into the compound by climbing over a security gate.

A CCTV camera was damaged before the man was disturbed and climbed back over the gate.

The two men then fled in the Volvo XC90 car that they arrived in.

Police Constable Vikki McKenna, who is leading Cheshire Constabulary's investigation into the incident, said:

"We are determined to establish the identities of the two men in the CCTV footage.

"Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and as part of our investigation we are urging anyone who believes they may know the identities of the men in the CCTV footage to come forward.

"The men were wearing facial coverings but you may recognise them from their builds, car and the clothes they had on.

"I would also like to appeal directly to the two men in the CCTV footage to get in touch."

Anyone with information about the men in the CCTV footage should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 607606, give the details via Cheshire Police's website or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
