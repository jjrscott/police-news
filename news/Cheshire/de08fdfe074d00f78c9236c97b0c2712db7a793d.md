**Police appeal for information after suspicious incident in Kelsall**

Shortly before 4pm on Monday 18 November a teenage girl was walking along Kelsborrow Way when she noticed someone appeared to be following her. She continued down Hillside Road and the man continued to follow her.

The man is described as being in his late teens early 20s and carrying an item in his hand.

He was wearing a waist length black coat with a beige top underneath, dark trousers and dark shoes.

Anyone with information, or you have dashcam footage please contact Cheshire Police on 101 or via www.cheshire.police.uk quoting IML 568187.
