**Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an assault in Runcorn.**

At around 3pm on Sunday 5 January, a woman was walking under a railway bridge near Beechwood Avenue when she was confronted by three men.

The woman was then assaulted before the men fled the scene.

It is believed that the offenders are aged between 19 to 21.

One of the men was clean shaven, wearing a grey tracksuit with white trainers.

Another had dark hair and was wearing a black Nike tracksuit with cuffed trousers, black trainers and had his hood up.

The third man was wearing a dark coloured tracksuit and a scarf.

Detective Sergeant John Rhodes, from Runcorn Local Policing Unit, said: "We would like to reassure the community that we are determined to track down those responsible for this assault which has left the victim extremely shaken.

"As part of our investigation we're keen to hear from anyone who witnesses the incident or anyone who recognises the description of the offenders.

"We are particularly keen to speak to a couple who were walking a small Yorkshire Terrier type dog near the time of the incident on Beechwood Avenue as we believe they could help us with our investigation.

"Alternatively, if anyone has any dashcam footage from the area around the time of the incident we would also like them to get in touch."

Anyone with information is urged to get in touch with Cheshire Police via 101 by quoting IML 608582 or via the form online https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/
