**Detectives are appealing for information from members of the public after a motorbike was stolen by burglars in Runcorn.**

Two males wearing dark clothing and face coverings stole the blue and silver bike after breaking into a shed at a domestic address on Maryhill Road in the Heath area.

They fled the area with the motorbike at around 12.30am on Friday 19 March.

The offenders and the bike arrived at Muncaster Court in the Castlefields area of Runcorn around half-an-hour later.

The motorbike was recovered by the police from Muncaster Court later that morning.

The offenders were nowhere in sight.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and officers are urging anyone with any information or footage that may help their investigation to get in touch.

Detective Sergeant Rob McLoughlin, of Runcorn Local Policing Unit, said: "We take all burglary incidents seriously at Cheshire Constabulary and are doing everything we can to establish the identities of the offenders and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"Enquiries are ongoing and we want to hear from anyone who was in the Heath or Castlefields area of Runcorn on the morning of Friday 19 March and believes they may have seen the burglars.

"We also want to speak to anyone who thinks they may know who the offenders are, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of them."

Anyone with information or footage that could be relevant to the investigation is asked to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 941992, give the details via - Report \- or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
