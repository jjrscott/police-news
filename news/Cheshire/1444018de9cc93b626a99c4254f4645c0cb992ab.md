**Detectives investigating an arson incident in Runcorn are appealing for information and footage from members of the public.**

At around 5am on Tuesday 12 May an offender rode to Bodmin Close in Brookvale on a bicycle.

They then got off their bike, walked up to a car in a communal car park and set the vehicle alight.

The offender, who had a slim to medium build and was wearing all dark clothing, then fled the scene on their bike.

The fire caused extensive damage to the front of the car before being extinguished by firefighters.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and officers are urging anyone with any information or footage that may aid their investigation to get in touch.

Detective Inspector David Hutcheon, of Runcorn Local Policing Unit, said: "Thankfully no-one was injured as a result of this incident and the fire was put out by firefighters before it had chance to spread beyond the car.

"It caused extensive damage to the front of the vehicle but the consequences of this incident could have been much worse.

"I would like to reassure the community that this is believed to have been an isolated incident and we are determined to establish who started the fire and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"Enquiries are ongoing and as part of our investigation we want to speak to anyone who was in the area and believes they may have seen the offender.

"We also want to hear from anyone who thinks they may know who the offender is, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of them."

Anyone with information or footage that may help the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 703015, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
