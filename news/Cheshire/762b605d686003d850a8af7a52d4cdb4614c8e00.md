**Officers in Ellesmere Port are appealing for information and footage from members of the public following an incident in the town.**

Shortly after 1am on Sunday 3 November a 56-year-old man from Ellesmere Port suffered head injuries whilst on foot on the A41 Chester Road in Little Sutton.

After losing consciousness, he woke up near to the Chesire Kebab takeaway with no recollection of how he sustained the injuries.

He was taken to hospital and was discharged on the same day after receiving treatment for his minor injuries.

Police Constable Andrew Balmforth, of Ellesmere Port Local Policing Unit, said: "We are determined to establish how the man sustained his injuries.

"Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and I urge anyone who was in the area and believes they may have witnessed something that may aid our investigation to get in touch.

"The same goes for anyone with a dashcam who was driving along the A41 Chester Road in Little Sutton and thinks they may have footage of the injured man, who is white and in his 50s."

Anyone with information or footage that may help officers with their investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 555598, or give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk.
