**Detectives are appealing for information and footage from the public following an aggravated burglary in Birchwood.**

The incident occurred at around 3am on Tuesday 22 December.

Two men have forced their way into a house on Whitethroat Walk purporting to be from the police.

They were armed with a number of weapons including a machete.

One of the offenders has assaulted the occupier and demanded he hand over money.

The pair then stole a wallet and made off in an unknown direction.

The 37-year-old victim attended hospital with injuries not believed to be serious.

Detective Constable Catherine Hudson, from Warrington Local Policing Unit, said: "Our enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and we are urging anyone who was in the area and saw anything that may help our investigation to get in touch.

"We also want to speak to anyone who may know who the offenders are, or have dashcam or CCTV footage of them."

Anyone with information or footage that may help the ongoing investigation should call Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 879377 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
