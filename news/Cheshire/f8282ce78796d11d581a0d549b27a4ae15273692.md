**Police are appealing for information following an assault outside a cinema in Ellesmere Port.**

The incident involved a group of men and occurred shortly after midnight on Friday 26 April 2019.

As part of their investigation officers arrested an 18-year-old man on suspicion of assault. He was later released without charge.

Enquiries have been ongoing since then and this week officers have released a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to in-connection with the incident.

A 21-year-old man from Chester received minor injuries to his head and was taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital.

Police Constable Chris Francis, from Ellesmere Port Local Policing Unit, said: "Our enquiries in relation to this incident are continuing and we are determined to establish exactly what happened.

"As part of those enquiries I believe the man in the CCTV images may have important information to help us with our investigation.

"If you think you recognise him or know who he is please call Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 38468, give details via our website or by calling Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

"I would also like to appeal directly to the man in the CCTV image to get in touch."
