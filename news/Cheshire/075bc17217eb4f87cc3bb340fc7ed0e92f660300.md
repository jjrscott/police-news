Officers are appealing for witnesses and dashcam footage after a pedestrian sustained serious injuries following a collision in Macclesfield.

At approximately 7.30am on Wednesday 16 October a red Volvo collided with a pedestrian on Hurdsfield Road, near to the junction of Hulley Road.

The pedestrian, a 61-year-old local man, sustained serious injuries and was taken to Salford Royal Hospital. He has since been discharged from hospital and is currently recovering at home.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and no arrests have been made.

Police Constable Eoin Anderson, of Cheshire Constabulary's Roads and Crime Unit, said: "Enquiries in relation to this collision are ongoing and we are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision or has any information which may aid our investigation.

"Hurdsfield Road is a busy road and at the time of the incident there would have been a number people in the area, both commuting to work and walking to school, who may have seen what happened and I'd urge them to get in touch.

"The same goes for anyone who was driving in the area and believes they have any dashcam footage which may be relevant to the investigation."

Anyone with information in relation to the incident should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 540247, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
