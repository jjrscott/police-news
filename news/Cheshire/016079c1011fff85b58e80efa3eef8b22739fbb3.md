Detectives are appealing for information following a robbery in Warrington.

At around 1pm on Wednesday 8 April an unknown man was a victim of a robbery near to Hood Manor Shopping Centre on Dorchester Road.

It is believed three men assaulted the victim before stealing his bag.

They then got into a car and left the area.

The victim ran from the scene and has not yet been identified.

Officers are encouraging the man to come forward in order to help the investigation and to offer him support.

Three men, aged 26, 22 and 20 were arrested on suspicion of robbery and have since been released under investigation.

Detective Sergeant Candice Sivori, of Warrington Local Policing Unit, said: "Firstly I want to encourage the man who we believe may have been a victim of a robbery and an assault to make contact with us.

"We have made a number of enquiries but we are keen to speak to the victim to establish what has taken place and to offer him support.

"I also want to encourage anyone who may have CCTV or dashcam footage at the time the robbery took place - or any information to get in touch."

If you know the identity of the man or have information in relation to the robbery please contact Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 677548.
