**Detectives are appealing for information from members of the public following a serious assault in Crewe.**

The incident occurred on Bradfield Road, near the Coppenhall Working Men's Club, shortly before 7pm on Friday 15 May.

The victim, a 28-year-old man from Crewe, was assaulted as he was walking a white dog without a lead.

He was punched in the face by a man who arrived at the scene from North Street in a grey Vauxhall Astra.

The offender fled in the car following the assault, travelling back along North Street towards what is known locally as the Cross Keys roundabout.

The incident left the victim with serious facial injuries. He was taken to hospital in an ambulance and has since been discharged after receiving treatment.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone who was in the area and witnessed the incident, or saw anything else that may help their investigation, to get in touch.

They also want to speak to anyone who believes they may know the identity of the offender or have information or footage concerning the car he was in.

Detective Constable Liz Rankin, of Crewe Local Policing Unit, said: "A dog walker suffered serious facial injuries as a result of this incident and we are determined to establish who inflicted the injuries.

"I would like to reassure the community that this appears to be an isolated incident and enquiries are ongoing in a bid to identify the offender.

"As part of our enquiries we want to speak to anyone who was in the area at around 7pm on Friday 15 May and saw anything that may aid our investigation.

"We also want to hear from anyone who believes they may know who the offender is or have information or CCTV or dashcam footage regarding the grey Vauxhall Astra he was travelling in."

Anyone with information or footage that may be relevant to the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 705701, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
