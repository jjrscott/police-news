**Officers have released CCTV images of a man they want to speak to in connection with a robbery incident at a convenience store in Warrington.**

A woman working at the store in Chapel Lane, Burtonwood, was threatened by a man holding a sharp instrument after challenging him as he attempted to leave the shop with items that had not been paid for.

He then fled with the stolen items in the direction of the Chapel House pub.

Enquiries in relation to the incident, which occurred at around 4.30pm on Thursday 17 September, are ongoing.

Detectives believe that the man in the CCTV images may be able to aid their enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Mark Naylor, of Warrington CID, said: "This incident has understandably left the store worker extremely shaken up.

"We are determined to establish who threatened her with a sharp instrument and stole the items from the store and have him brought to justice.

"As part of our ongoing enquiries we have released CCTV images of a man we believe may have important information to help our investigation.

"If you think you recognise the man in the CCTV images or know who or where he is please call us on 101, quoting IML 807399, or give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report.

"Alternatively, you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

"I would also like to appeal directly to the man in the CCTV images to get in touch."
