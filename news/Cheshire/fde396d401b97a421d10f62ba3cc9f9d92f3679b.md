Police are appealing for witnesses after a man was seriously assaulted in Runcorn.

The incident occurred shortly before 7pm on Friday, 14 February. The victim, a 43-year-old local man, was parked on Grangemoor in his silver Ford Fiesta, when a man approached his car window. He smashed the window, stabbed the victim's chest and slashed his face. He is currently in hospital in a serious but stable condition.

The victim believes he may have been followed by a dark coloured vehicle, which could be linked to the incident.

Officers are in the area this morning and are keen to speak to anyone who may have been nearby at the time, and who saw anything suspicious. In particular, there may have been passers-by or cars driving past who could have captured the incident on their dashcam.

If you have any information, please contact Cheshire police on 101, or visit www.cheshire.police.uk, where you can also upload any footage you have that could help.
