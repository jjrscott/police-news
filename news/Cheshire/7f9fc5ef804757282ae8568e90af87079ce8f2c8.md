Detectives investigating a firearms discharge in Crewe are urging people to come forward with information.

At 10pm on Sunday 19 April a shot was fired outside an address on The Birches in Davenport Avenue.

There were a number of people outside the address at the time however there were no reports of anyone sustaining any injuries.

Police were made aware of the incident the following day and, since then, an investigation has been ongoing to establish the circumstances.

A number of enquiries have been carried out in the local area over the past few days and officers from the Local Policing Unit - supported by armed officers - have executed warrants at addresses in Flag Lane, Derrington Avenue and Fanshaw Walk.

Officers remain in the area to provide reassurance to the local community.

At this stage no arrests have been made.

Detective Inspector Claire Jesson, from Crewe Local Policing Unit, said: "I appreciate this is a concerning incident for those living in the local area and I want to reassure residents that we are doing everything we can to piece together what has happened and trace those responsible.

"Officers will continue to patrol the area and anyone with any concerns is urged to speak to them.

"This is a fast-moving and complex investigation and over the past few days we have been carrying out a number of enquiries including house-to-house enquiries and we have executed three warrants at addresses in Crewe.

"However we need the help and support of the public in identifying and tracing the offenders and I would urge anyone with any information to come forward - even the smallest piece of information can be useful.
