Detectives investigating a stabbing in Warrington are appealing for information.

Shortly before 12.30am on Saturday 20 June police were made aware of a 24-year-old man arriving at Warrington Hospital with stab wounds.

"At this stage we believe he was attacked somewhere in the Bewsey area by two men.

"While the investigation progresses I am appealing to anyone who may have seen a man being attacked or been in the Bewsey area that night to get in touch.

"If you have any information including CCTV or dash cam footage which may assist the investigation please come forward."
