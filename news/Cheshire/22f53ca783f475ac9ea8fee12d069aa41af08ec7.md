Police are appealing for information after a projector being used as part of Remembrance Day commemorations was stolen from outside a church in Northwich.

Sometime between 1pm on Saturday 14 September and 7.30am on Monday 16 November an unknown person broke through a security fence and stole the projector from outside St Helens Church on Church Road.

Chief Inspector Gary Smith, from Northwich Local Policing Unit, said: "The piece of equipment was being used to project an image of a poppy onto the church tower - acting as a poignant reminder of what our loved ones went through during the two world wars.

"To stoop so low, at a time when we are remembering those who gave their lives in battle, is simply despicable.

"I would urge anyone with any information in relation to the theft to contact the team here at Northwich by calling 101.

"I would also appeal directly to the person who took it to do the right thing and come forward. The projector is now likely to have very little monetary value but is of great importance to the church - and the wider community - and I would ask that you return it so that it can be used to pay tribute to those who sacrificed their lives."

Anyone with any information in relation to the theft is asked to call Cheshire Police on 101, quoting IML 853003, or visit https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/ .

Information can also be reported anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
