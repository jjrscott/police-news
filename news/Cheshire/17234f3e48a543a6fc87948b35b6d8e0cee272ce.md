**Officers are appealing for information and footage from members of the public following a robbery incident in Elton, near Chester.**

At around 9pm on Thursday 2 January a 15-year-old boy was approached by a group of teenagers on Ash Road.

One of them punched the victim in the head from behind. The others then took him to the floor.

After kicking the victim whilst he was on the ground, the group took off his black Nike Air Max 270 trainers and stole his black Jack Wolfskin rucksack.

The victim managed to retrieve one of his trainers before running away.

He sustained minor injuries during the incident, which occurred close to the train track leading to Ince and Elton railway station.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and officers are appealing for anyone who was in the area and witnessed anything that may be relevant to their investigation to get in touch.

They also want to speak to anyone who believes they may know who the offenders are, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of them.

Detective Constable Andrea Ellis said: "The victim was subjected to a frightening ordeal that understandably left him extremely shaken up.

"We are determined to establish the identities of the offenders and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"Enquiries are ongoing and I urge anyone who was in the area and saw anything that may aid our investigation to come forward.

"The same goes for anyone who thinks they may know who the offenders are or have CCTV or dashcam footage of them."

Anyone with information or footage that may help the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 603262, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111
