**Detectives have released CCTV images of two males they want to speak to in connection with robbery incidents in Widnes.**

At around 9.10pm on Saturday 8 February two males entered the M&S Late Shop on Derby Road.

They demanded cigarettes and showed a member of staff an axe before stealing a quantity of sweets and fleeing in the direction of Peel House Lane.

A few minutes later the same males ordered food from a member of staff at Peel House Fish Bar.

They claimed to have no money and demanded that she hand over the till.

When another member of staff appeared and ordered them to leave the takeaway in Peel House Lane, they produced a knife and threatened him before fleeing on foot empty handed.

Enquiries in relation to the incidents are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone who believes they may know the identities of the males in the CCTV images to get in touch.

Detective Inspector Ian Whiley, of Widnes Local Policing Unit, said: "We are determined to establish who were responsible for the two robbery incidents and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"As part of our ongoing enquiries we are looking to trace the two males in the CCTV images.

"If you think you recognise them or think you may know who they are please call us at Widnes Police Station on 101, quoting IML 632336, give us the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

"I would also like to appeal directly to the males in the CCTV images to get in touch."
