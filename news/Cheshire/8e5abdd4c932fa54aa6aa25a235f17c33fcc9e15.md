Police are continuing to patrol on the Brookhouse Estate area with a second Dispersal Order in place tonight.

We are continuing to conduct high visibility patrols in the area and are putting the Dispersal Order in place from 5pm tonight (24 November) until 4pm tomorrow on the Brookhouse Estate.

The dispersal powers, under Section 34 of the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 have been authorised in order to deter anyone acting in an anti-social manner or likely to, from returning to a specific area for up to 24 hours, and officers and PCSOs will be using those powers to prevent any disorder.

The order covers the area of Davenport Avenue, Claughton Avenue and the Brookhouse Estate where you will see an increased police presence.

Inspector Andy Smith, of Crewe Local Policing Unit, said: "We're continuing to see anti-social behaviour in the area which will not be tolerated. We want to make sure that we are doing everything we can to deter people from this type of behaviour so we will continue with our high visibility patrols and use the dispersal order to prevent further crimes being committed.

"If you spot suspicious behaviour or anti-social behaviour in the Brookhouse Estate, contact us as it is happening, whether that's face to face or by calling us on 101. Call 999 in an emergency. "
