**Officers are appealing for information and dashcam footage following a collision involving three vehicles in Hatton Heath.**

At around 5.20pm on Wednesday 2 September officers were called to the A41 Whitchurch Road following reports of collision involving a silver Vauxhall Astra, a white Ford Transit van and a blue Peugeot 5008.

The driver of the Peugeot, a woman in her 30s, was taken to hospital with serious injuries.

Both drivers of the other vehicles sustained minor injuries.

Officers are now urging anyone with information or dashcam footage which could help them with their appeal to get in touch.

Police Constable Lee Spencer said: "We are in the early stages of the investigation and enquiries are very much ongoing.

"During the time of the collision, the A41 would have been particularly busy and I would like to hear from anyone who believes that they witnessed the incident.

"We are also keen to hear from anyone who may have caught dashcam footage of the collision, or the vehicles before the incident, as we believe it could help with our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to call Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 795603 or report it via the Cheshire Police website.

Information can also be reported to Crimestoppers anonymously via 0800 555 111 or report it via the Crimestoppers website.
