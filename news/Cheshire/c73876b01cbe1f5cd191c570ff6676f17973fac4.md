Officers from Warrington Problem Solving Team have charged a man with grooming a teenage girl from the town.

Christopher Edwards was arrested by officers on Friday 15 January after a warrant was executed at his home in Failsworth, Greater Manchester.

He has since been charged with attempting to meet a girl under the age of 16 following grooming, engaging in sexual communications with a child and breach of a sexual harm prevention order.

The charges relate to incidents which occurred in November and December.

He has also been charged with possession of a class A drug (cocaine).

The 37-year-old appeared at Warrington Magistrates' Court on Saturday 16 January.

He was remanded in custody and is set to appear at Liverpool Crown Court on Friday 12 February.
