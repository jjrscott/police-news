**Detectives investigating an incident in Ellesmere Port are appealing for information from members of the public.**

At around 7.30pm on Monday 30 November a large group of males approached a silver Vauxhall Astra at Whitby Park in Stanney Lane.

It was in a car park near to a skate park.

Armed with crowbars, metal bars and baseball bats, the group demanded that the driver get out of the car.

They opened his door and then assaulted him with their hands and feet.

The group also smashed up his car, causing extensive damage to the windows and bodywork.

The front passenger sustained a hand injury as a result of her window being smashed with a crowbar.

The group also fired a firework at the car before running off in multiple directions.

The incident left the victims with minor injuries.

The young man and the young woman, who are both from Ellesmere Port, did not go to hospital.

The offenders were wearing dark clothing and face coverings.

There were approximately 20 people in the group and they all looked to be young men or boys in their late teens.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone with any information that may help their investigation to come forward.

Detective Constable Tim Cope, of Ellesmere Port Local Policing Unit, said: "This was a terrifying incident that has understandably left the victims extremely shaken up.

"It has also left them with minor injuries.

"I would like to reassure members of the community that this is believed to be a targeted attack and an isolated incident and we are determined to establish the identities of the offenders and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"Enquiries are ongoing and I urge anyone who was in the area and saw anything that may help our investigation to get in touch.

"Perhaps you witnessed the incident or believe that you saw the offenders, either before they attacked the driver and smashed up his car or as they were fleeing the scene.

"We also want to hear from anyone who thinks they may know who the offenders are, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of them."

Anyone with information or footage that may aid the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 863247, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
