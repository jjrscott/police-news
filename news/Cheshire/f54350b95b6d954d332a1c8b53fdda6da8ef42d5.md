Detectives are appealing for witnesses and dashcam footage following an armed robbery at an off-licence in Wistaston.

At around 7.30pm on Tuesday 4 February a store worker was in the stock room at Bargain Booze on Kings Drive when he heard somebody entering the store.

The worker checked the CCTV cameras and saw three unknown men, armed with baseball bats, who were all dressed in dark clothing with their hoods up and wearing balaclavas. He immediately contacted police and waited in the back of the store.

Meanwhile the three offenders raided the store and stole a quantity of cash, cigarettes and alcohol before fleeing on foot, travelling towards White Hart Lane.

One of the men was carrying a JD Sports carrier bag.

Detective Sergeant Steven Smith said: "While the shop worker was in the store room at the time of this incident and did not sustain any injuries, he has been left shaken up as a result of his ordeal.

"Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and we are doing all that we can to trace the people responsible.

"As part of the investigation into the incident I am keen to hear from anyone who was in the area around the time it occurred and believes they may have witnessed something that may be relevant to our enquiries.

"I also want to hear from motorists with dashcams who were driving on Church Lane or Kings Drive between 7.15pm and 7.45pm.

"If you think that you have any information that could help our investigation, no matter how small, please call the team here at Crewe CID on 101."

Detective Inspector Claire Jesson added: "This is now the fourth robbery of a similar nature in Crewe in recent weeks and I understand the concern it may cause in the local community.

"I would like to reassure residents that there is a lot of work taking place in relation to these incidents and we are committed to doing all that we can to trace the people responsible.

"At the current time we are keeping an open mind as to whether the incidents are linked."

Anyone with any information or dashcam footage that may aid detectives with their investigation is urged to contact Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 628956, or give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about .

Information can also be given to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously .
