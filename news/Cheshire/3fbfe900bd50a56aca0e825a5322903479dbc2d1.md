Police are appealing for information following a deliberate fire at two outbuildings in Chelford Lane, Over Peover.

In the fire 70 cars belonging to a number of people were damaged, some destroyed. Detectives will be speaking with the owners of the cars who are aware of the incident.

The team investigating are looking to speak to anyone who saw suspicious behaviour in the area on the evening of Sunday 13 December at around 9.30pm onwards - the evening before the fire started. They also want to speak with anyone who saw activity on the evening of the fire which occurred around 9pm 14 December.

DC Clare Slattery said: "We're keen to speak with anyone who saw anything out of the ordinary, or that didn't seem right at the time, to help us with our investigation.

"We are also aware that people are going into the barn to take items from the cars - not only is this barn part of a police and fire service investigation, taking items from the scene is theft and you will be prosecuted. You're also trespassing on private land and putting yourself at risk by going into the barn that is not safe due to the fire damage. You have been warned."

Anyone with information should contact Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 873803. Alternatively information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
