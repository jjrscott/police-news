**Detectives investigating an attempted burglary in Runcorn have renewed their appeal for information.**

At the end of April detectives released CCTV images of two males they want to speak to in connection with the incident, which occurred in Heath Road South at around 4.40pm on Wednesday 11 March.

After breaking into a house, the offenders fled empty handed after being disturbed by an occupier.

As part of their investigation detectives want to speak to the two males in the CCTV images and are renewing their appeal for anyone who recognises the males or has information regarding their whereabouts to get in touch.

It is believed that the males may have links to West Yorkshire as well as to the Rochdale area of Greater Manchester.

Detective Constable Ciara Murphy, of Runcorn Local Policing Unit, said: "We are determined to establish the identities of all those responsible for the attempted burglary and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"We believe that tracing and speaking to the two males in the CCTV images will help us as we endeavour to achieve those goals.

"If you think you recognise the males in the images, or know who they or where they are, please contact us at Runcorn Police Station on 101, quoting IML 658280, give us the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

"I would also like to appeal directly to the males in the CCTV images to get in touch."
