A man from Chester who repeatedly broke into people's cars in the city has been jailed.

Simon Hughes, of no fixed address, was sentenced at Chester Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 15 April.

Appearing via video link, he was jailed for 44 weeks.

The 46-year-old had earlier pleaded guilty to two counts of theft from a motor vehicle, vehicle interference and fraud by false representation.

The court heard that Hughes' offending began on Sunday 12 January when he broke into a vehicle parked in a car park off New Crane Street.

After smashing the rear window he stole a number of gifts that had been given to the car's owner, a teacher, including chocolates and alcohol.

Just under two weeks later, on Saturday 25 January, Hughes was captured on CCTV footage checking an insecure car on a driveway in Lache Lane.

Thankfully, on that occasion there was nothing of value in the vehicle and he left empty handed.

The owner of a car on Welsh Road in Doddleston was not so much. At some point between Friday 10 April and Saturday 11 April Hughes broke into the vehicle and stole a bank card, Berghaus jacket and a bag.

He went on to use the card at Saltney Service Station and a Morrisons store in Chester, spending a total of Â£56.02.

Hughes was arrested on Tuesday 14 April and was subsequently charged in connection with the incidents.

Following his sentencing, Detective Constable Gareth Yates, of Chester CID, said: "Simon Hughes is a repeat offender who clearly has no regard for the law. I am delighted that he has now been brought to justice.

"I would like to praise the officers involved in this case for all their hard work in securing this conviction.

"I would also like to thank the members of the public who provided us with information and CCTV footage that helped us to both catch Hughes and ensure that he is made to face the consequences of his actions.

"Vehicles in Chester will be less likely to be broken into now that he is behind bars."
