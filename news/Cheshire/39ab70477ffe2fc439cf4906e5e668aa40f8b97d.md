Police are appealing for witnesses following a fatal collision in Marton.

At around 1.15am on 29 March a grey BMW was driving along Dalefords Lane in Marton near Winsford when it left the road and collided with a tree.

Sgt Simon Degg said: "The driver, a 29-year-old man from the Winsford area, sadly died at the scene. His next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers. I'd urge anyone who witnessed the collision or has dash cam footage that may help our investigation to contact us."
