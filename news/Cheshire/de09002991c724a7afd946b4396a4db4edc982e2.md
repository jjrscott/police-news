**Detectives investigating an incident in Warrington are appealing for information from members of the public.**

It occurred at Alexandra Park in Stockton Heath at around 10pm on Saturday 30 May.

The victim, a local woman in her 40s, was walking her dogs in the park.

A stranger walked up to her and inappropriately touched the victim over her clothing.

At that point one of the victim's dogs bit the unknown man.

He then walked off along Fairfield Road towards the swing bridge that leads to Wilderspool Causeway.

The offender is described as white, around 5' 9" tall with a slim build. He looked to be in his mid-30s and had short dark hair and was wearing dark clothing.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone who was in the area and witnessed anything that may aid their investigation to come forward.

They also want to speak to anyone who believes they may know who the offender is, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of him.

Detective Constable Lee Ellis, of Warrington CID, said: "The victim has understandably been left shaken up by what happened. She is being supported by specialist officers.

"I would like to reassure residents that this is believed to be an isolated incident, we have stepped up patrols in the area and we are doing everything we can to identify the offender and make him face the consequences of his actions.

"As part of our ongoing enquiries we are appealing for anyone who was in the area and saw the incident, or anything else that may help the investigation, to contact us at Warrington Police Station.

"We are particularly keen to hear from the people who were in the park when the incident occurred.

"We also want to talk to anyone who believes that they may know the identity of the offender, or have footage of him."

Anyone with information or CCTV or dashcam footage that could assist the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 718193, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
