**Following an earlier appeal, detectives have now issued CCTV of a man they want to speak to following a robbery at a shop in Northwich.**

At around 9.30pm on Thursday 26 December a report was received that a man had entered a store on Victoria Road and demanded a quantity of cigarettes.

He then fled the scene towards Greenall Road.

Officers have now issued CCTV images of a man that they would like to speak to in connection with the incident.

Detective Constable John Corrigan said: "We are keen to track down the man pictured in the CCTV to speak to him in relation to this incident which left staff understandably shaken.

"I want to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time of the robbery and believes they may have witnessed something that may be relevant to our investigation.

"The same goes for any motorists with a dashcam who were driving in the Victoria Road area around the time of the incident.

"I urge anyone with footage or information, no matter how small, to get in touch with the team here at Northwich."

Anyone with information that may help detectives with their investigation should call Cheshire
Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 597887, or give the details via our website.

Information can also be passed on to independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via the Crimestoppers website.
