**Detectives investigating a burglary in Widnes are appealing for information from members of the public.**

At some point between 1.30pm and 10.15pm on Friday 21 February a house in Fieldway was broken into.

A quantity of jewellery and a First World War medal of great sentimental value to the owner were stolen during the burglary.

No-one was at home when the incident occurred.

Enquiries in relation to the burglary are ongoing and detectives are appealing for anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area to get in touch.

They also want to speak to anyone who believes they have CCTV or dashcam footage that may be relevant to the investigation, or information regarding the stolen medal.

Detective Sergeant Roberts, of Widnes Local Policing Unit, said: "Burglary is a serious offence which is always a deeply upsetting experience for the victims.

"On this occasion the upset has been heightened by the fact that a First World War medal with great sentimental value was stolen during the incident.

"I urge anyone who believes they may have seen the medal since the burglary took place, or been offered the chance to buy it, to get in touch.

"I also appeal to anyone with information regarding the burglary itself to come forward. Perhaps you saw something suspicious in Fieldway on Friday 21 February, or maybe you have CCTV or dashcam footage that may help our investigation into the incident."

Anyone with information or footage that may aid the ongoing investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 643056, or give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about.

Alternatively, information can be reported to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously.
