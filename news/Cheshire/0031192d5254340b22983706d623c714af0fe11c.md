**Officers are appealing for more information following a fatal collision in Warmingham.**

Just before 11.10am on Wednesday 12 August police were called to School Lane following reports of a collision involving a white Ford transit van and a red Fiat 500.

Anyone with any information is urged to call 101 quoting IML 778236 or report it via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report/

Alternatively anyone with information can report to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
