Updated News Post

**Officers investigating a fatal collision in Handforth have renewed their appeal for information.**

The incident on Dean Road, which becomes Handforth Road, involved a black Suzuki Grand Vitara car and a cyclist.

It was reported to the police around 1am on Saturday 22 August.

Officers attended the scene and discovered that the cyclist had sustained serious injuries.

Sadly, the 43-year-old local man was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.

His family are being supported by specialist officers.

The driver of the SUV car stopped at the scene following the collision.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and no arrests have been made.

The enquiries that have been carried out so far have established that the cyclist was lying in the road when the collision occurred.

Officers want to speak to anyone who was in the area and believes that they may have seen the cyclist prior to the collision, or captured relevant footage on a dashcam.

They particularly want to talk to a woman with dark hair who was driving a small black saloon car, possibly a BMW, along Dean Road around the time of the incident, between 12.40am and 1am.

Anyone with information or dashcam footage that may aid the investigation is asked to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 786461, or give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report.
