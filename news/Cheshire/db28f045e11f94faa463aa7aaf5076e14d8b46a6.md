A man has been charged with murder and threatening a person with a bladed article in a public place following an incident in Ellesmere Port.

Ben Wilkinson, aged 25, of Ellesmere Port has been remanded into custody and is due to appear before Chester Magistrates' Court on Monday 16th March 2020.

At 8.46pm on Saturday 14 March police were called to reports of a disturbance on Pooltown Road.

Officers swiftly attended the scene to find the victim - Steven Carey, aged 31 - had sustained serious injuries. He was taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital where sadly, despite the best efforts on all involved, he died.

Two other men who were also arrested in connection with the incident - one aged 25 and one aged 35 - have been now been released with without charge.
