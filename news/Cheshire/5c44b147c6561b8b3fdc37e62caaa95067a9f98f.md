**Detectives have released a CCTV image of a man they want to speak to in connection with a robbery in Northwich.**

At around 3.20am on Sunday 23 February a 19-year-old woman was walking up Castle Hill, near to Kingsley Carpets, when a man approached her from behind.

He stole her handbag and then ran off in the direction of Castle Court.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives believe that the man in the CCTV image may have vital information to aid their investigation.

They are urging anyone who recognises him or thinks they may know who he is to get in touch.

Detective Constable Neil Wharmby, of Northwich CID, said: "The victim was understandably left shaken up as a result of this frightening incident.

"We are determined to establish who committed the robbery and bring him to justice and we believe that the man in the CCTV image may have important information to help us achieve that goal.

"If you think you recognise the man or know who he is please call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 644104, give us the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

"I would also like to appeal directly to the man in the CCTV image to get in touch."
