Detectives are appealing for witnesses following a burglary at a hotel in Frodsham.

At around 1am on Thursday 19 March staff members disturbed two males who were acting suspiciously in the reception area of Forest Hills Hotel off Bellemonte Road.

They then fled the scene towards Simons Lane.

Officers swiftly attended the scene and, supported by the police helicopter, made a search of the area.

Two teenagers, both aged 17, were arrested on suspicion of burglary and assault.

Detective Inspector Nick Henderson, of Chester Local Policing Unit, said: "While we have made arrests in connection with the incident we are continuing to appeal for any anyone with an information, which could assist with our ongoing enquiries.

"As part of our investigation we want to hear from anyone who may have seen or heard something suspicious - even the smallest piece of information could be vital.

"Alternatively, we want to hear from anyone who may have caught the offenders on dashcam or CCTV footage."

During the arrest two police officers were injured - one was taken to hospital.

DI Henderson added: "This is believed to be an isolated incident and I want to take this time to reassure the public that we will do everything possible to establish exactly what has happened, to locate the offenders and to ensure they are brought to justice."
