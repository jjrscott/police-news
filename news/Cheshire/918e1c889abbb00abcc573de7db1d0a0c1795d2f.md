Detectives investigating a series of hoax bomb threats at schools Cheshire, Greater Manchester and Devon have questioned two teenagers.

The boys, aged 14 and 15, were both questioned under police caution on Thursday 17 December in relation to hoax bomb threats at Culcheth High School, Golborne High School and Bedford High School as well as two schools in Barnstaple, North Devon.

The two boys, who are both from the Greater Manchester area, have since been released pending further enquires.

Their questioning forms part of a joint ongoing investigation by detectives from Cheshire Constabulary, Greater Manchester Police and Devon & Cornwall Police.

Detective Sergeant Alison McLoughlin from Chester Constabulary said: "I know that these incidents caused considerable concern to both the pupils and parents at the schools involved and I hope that this development will provide some reassurance.

"Enquiries are continuing and I would like to thank the schools involved for their support along with our colleagues at Greater Manchester and Devon and Cornwall Police."
