Police are appealing for information following a suspicious incident in Alsager.

At around 3.15pm on Thursday 18 March a 12-year-old boy was walking along a track just off Lodge Road and Sandbach Road North when he was approached by a man.

The man put his arms out, alarming the boy, who pushed past him and ran off to safety.

The man is described as tall, slim and in his 50s with green/brown eyes. He was wearing a black beanie hat and a black snood, a grey patchy shirt and a grey patchy zip up hoody. The patches were described as possibly rips. He was also wearing brown cargo type trousers.

DC Gail Burndred said: "The man didn't say anything to the boy but his actions clearly alarmed him and he did the right thing by telling an adult who then reported it to police.

"We want to reassure you that we are making a number of enquiries to locate the man. We have been patrolling in the area and will continue to do so, and we are linking in with the local schools to give advice and support to parents and children. Anyone who sees suspicious activity should contact police on 101."

DC Burndred added: "We would also appeal for dashcam footage from anyone driving around the area of Lodge Road and Sandbach Road North around school pick up time on 18 March."

If you have any information please call police on 101 or go to our website quoting IML 941529.
