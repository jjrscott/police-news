**Officers are appealing for information and dashcam footage following a collision involving a cyclist and a heavy goods vehicle in Willaston.**

At around 7.50am on Tuesday 8 September officers were called to the A51 on the Peacock roundabout following reports that a cyclist had been knocked off his bike by a HGV.

The cyclist, a man, sustained minor injuries as a result and was taken to hospital.

The driver of the HGV continued onto the A51 towards Alvaston roundabout.

Officers now want to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision or may have dashcam footage to come forward.

Police Constable Emma Flinn said: "Although the cyclist only sustained minor injuries, the result of the collision could have been a lot worse and have had devastating consequences.

"I would like to take this time to appeal to anyone who may have witnessed the collision who has not yet come forward to do so.

"The same goes for anyone who may have caught dashcam footage of the collision or of the HGV around the time of the incident as we believe it will assist us with our enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to call Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 799738 or report it via our website.

Alternatively, information can be provided to Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 or report it via the Crimestoppers website.
