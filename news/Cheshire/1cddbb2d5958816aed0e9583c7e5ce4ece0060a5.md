**Officers have released CCTV images of two men they are looking to trace following a burglary in Warrington.**

A mobile phone repair shop on Knutsford Road in Latchford was broken into at around 9.45pm on Tuesday 17 March.

The Phone Whisperer shop was closed at the time.

A quantity of mobile phones and accessories were stolen during the burglary.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and as part of their investigation officers want to speak to the men in the CCTV images.

They are urging anyone who recognises them or thinks they may know who they are to get in touch.

Police Constable Andrew Schofield, of Warrington Local Policing Unit, said: "We are determined to establish who carried out the burglary, make them face the consequences of their actions and have the stolen items returned to the shop.

"We believe that tracing and speaking to the two men in the CCTV images will help us achieve those goals.

"If you think you recognise the men in the images or know who they are please contact us at Warrington Police Station on 101, quoting IML 663091, give us the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

"I would also like to appeal directly to the men in the CCTV images to get in touch."
