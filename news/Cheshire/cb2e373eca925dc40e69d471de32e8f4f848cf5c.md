Cheshire Constabulary is aware of numerous news articles suggesting the possibility of a link between five historic murder/suicides cases comprising of two incidents in Cheshire, two in Greater Manchester and one in Cumbria.

Detective Chief Superintendent Aaron Duggan said: "These articles were based upon a report completed by a member of Police staff working in the Coroner's Office in Cheshire. The report was not approved by either the Constabulary or the Coroner's office. Some media reports have referred to the author as a Senior Coroner or Coroner and this is factually incorrect. The circumstances by which the report was shared with the media are subject to an internal review.

"The contents of the report and its conclusions are being considered by detectives. At this time, there is no reason to believe that the cases were not investigated by the Police appropriately. They were also the subject of inquests. For these reasons, the Constabulary has not re-opened the cases, however this decision will remain under review.

"The media coverage has caused distress to families of the deceased. We are offering support to the individuals who have been involved directly in these cases and will continue to do so."
