Detectives in Macclesfield are urging motorists to vigilant following a spate of keyless car thefts.

Over the past two months four cars have been stolen in the area, with Fiats particularly being targeted.

Detectives are concerned by the recent spike in thefts and are appealing for residents to take action to reduce their chances of becoming victims.

Detective Sergeant Dave Jarvis, of Macclesfield CID, said: "Cars are becoming more and more high-tech. While this can offer convenience to drivers, it can also be exploited by thieves.

"There has been a worrying recent rise in keyless car thefts in Macclesfield, with criminals using cloned keys and other technology to enable them to steal vehicles without having ever touched its keys.

"We are doing all we can to tackle the problem but we need residents' help to drive down this type of crime.

"By assessing your current security measures and taking a few simple steps, you can significantly reduce the chances of your car being stolen.

"Think about how you store your keys at home. Keeping your keyless entry fob out of sight is not enough, I urge drivers to keep both sets of keys in a Faraday bag. These block the signal from the fob and are widely available.

"I also encourage motorists to keep their cars in a garage if possible.

"If you don't have a garage, mechanical steering locks and trackers are also effective in protecting vehicles from thieves."

Other tips for owners of cars with keyless entry systems include:

 * Contact your dealer for information and guidance regarding the digital features in your car - have there been any software updates you can take advantage of?
 * Check if your keyless entry fob can be turned off. If it can, and your dealer can confirm this, then do so overnight.
 * Keep an eye out for suspicious activity in your neighbourhood and report anything unusual to the police.

Anyone with information about vehicle crime is urged to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
