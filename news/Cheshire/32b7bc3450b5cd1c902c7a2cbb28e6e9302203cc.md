**Four men have been arrested in-connection with a burglary at a convenience store in Culcheth.**

At 1.14am this morning (Friday 15 November) officers from Warrington responded to an alarm that had activated at the Co-op on Common Lane.

When they arrived at the scene, one man was found in a car containing a large number of cigarette packets.

Three other men fled from the scene but were located a short time later following support from the firearms officers, the police dog unit and helicopter.

A 42-year-old man from Chester, a 20-year-old man and 23-year-old man both from Liverpool and a local 23-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of burglary.

They all remain in police custody to be questioned by detectives.
