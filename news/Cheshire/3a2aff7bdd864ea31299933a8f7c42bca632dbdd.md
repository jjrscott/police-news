Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an attempted robbery in Macclesfield.

Sometime between 1.15pm and 1.40pm on Monday 10 February a man was pushing his bicycle along Chester Road, near the junction of Ivy Road, when an unknown male approached him.

The male pushed the victim before demanding money.

A passer-by intervened and the suspect fled the scene.

The male offender is white, of slim build and was wearing a black hooded top, black joggers and had a black rucksack with coloured markings.

Officers are now appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the incident to come forward.

Detective Constable Andy Cole, of Macclesfield Local Policing Unit, said: "We are keen to track down this offender and bring him to justice.

"The outcome of this incident could have been a lot worse.

"I am keen to hear from anyone who may have been driving around the Chester Road, Ivy Road area of Macclesfield on Monday and may have caught dashcam footage of the suspect.

"I also want anyone who witnessed the incident or may know who the offender is to come forward."

Anyone with information or dashcam footage is asked to call Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 633793 or report via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report/

Alternatively, report any information to independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 or via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
