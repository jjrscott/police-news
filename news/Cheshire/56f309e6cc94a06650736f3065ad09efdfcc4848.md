Police are appealing for witnesses following a suspicious incident in Runcorn.

Shortly before 1pm today (7 May) a 9-year-old boy was walking along an alleyway in the Glen when he was approached from behind and grabbed by a man. The boy ran home and told his mum who reported the incident to police.

DS Ian Smith said: "The boy did the right thing by going straight home and telling an adult straightaway. We have been making numerous enquiries in the area including checking CCTV and have stepped up our patrols in the Glen to provide reassurance.

"I would appeal to anyone with information to contact police so that we can establish the circumstances."

Anyone with information should contact Cheshire Police on 101 or via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/contact/af/contact-us/ quoting IML 699348 .

Alternatively, information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
