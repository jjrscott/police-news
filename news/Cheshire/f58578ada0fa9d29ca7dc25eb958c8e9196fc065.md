Police are continuing to patrol in the Brookhouse Estate area following on from the weekend's police activity.

A Section 60 order was in place over the weekend to prevent crime and anti-social behaviour and saw a number of people stopped - some were arrested for drugs offences.
We are continuing to conduct high visibility patrols in the area and are putting a Dispersal Order in place from 5pm tonight (23 November) until 4pm tomorrow on the Brookhouse Estate.

The dispersal powers, under Section 34 of the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 have been authorised in order to deter anyone acting in an anti-social manner or likely to, from returning to a specific area for up to 24 hours, and officers and PCSOs will be using those powers to prevent any disorder.

The order covers the area of Davenport Avenue, Claughton Avenue and the Brookhouse Estate where you will see an increased police presence.

Inspector Andy Smith, of Crewe Local Policing Unit, said: "As you know there were a small number of incidents over the weekend involving threats of violence with knives. We want to make sure that we are doing everything we can to deter people from this type of behaviour. We have put the Order in place as we believe it necessary to demonstrate to the community we are on the front foot in our response to violent crime and to reassure local residents that we are doing everything we can to keep them safe."
