Police in Cheshire are warning residents to remain vigilant following a number of reports of distraction thefts in the eastern area of the county.

Since Wednesday 2 December officers have dealt with four separate incidents involving the theft, or attempted theft, of high value watches.

These have included incidents in Prestbury, Wilmslow and Alderley Edge.

On each occasion the victims, who were all men, have been approached by unknown women who have used a variety of distraction techniques - including claiming to be prostitutes - in order to steal high value watches.

The suspects are described as women in their late 30s and of eastern European origin.

Following the incidents the offenders are believed to have fled the scene in a vehicle waiting nearby.

Detective Sergeant Simon Mills from Macclesfield CID, said: "Enquiries in relation to these incidents are ongoing and I would urge anyone with any information which may aid our investigation to get in touch.

"The same goes for anyone who believes that they may have been targeted.

"I would also like to urge residents in the area to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity, it's also important to ensure that their watches are kept secure and not on show."

Anyone with any information in relation to the incidents is asked to contact Cheshire Police on 101, quoting IML 864529, or visit https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/.

Information can also be reported anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
