**Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a car driver failed to stop following a collision with a cyclist in Widnes.**

An 18-year-old man was riding along Milton Road toward Riverside College between 3.30pm and 4pm on Wednesday 16 September when a grey Ford Kuga collided with him.

The driver drove off after the collision, turning left onto Cameron Road.

The teenager was airlifted to hospital.

He has since been discharged after receiving treatment for the serious injuries he sustained as a result of the collision.

Detective Constable Tina Jackson, of Widnes Local Policing Unit, said: "Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and we urge anyone who witnessed the collision or has information that may help us identify the driver or locate the grey Ford Kuga to contact us.

"If you were in the area at the time and have dashcam footage that may aid our investigation you can submit it via our website. Please make sure you reference IML 806505."
