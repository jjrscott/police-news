The 53-year-old had been in hospital since Sunday 6 October, when he was assaulted in Crown Street, Warrington, at around 12.15pm.

Detective Inspector Helen Clegg said: "Firstly I would like to reassure the two people in these CCTV images that we do not believe that they have committed any offences.

"We simply want to speak to them as they were in the area at the time of the assault and we believe they may have witnessed it.

"I appeal directly to the people in the CCTV images, as well as to anyone who recognises them, to contact the team here at Warrington on 101, quoting IML 531869, or via www.cheshire.police.uk.

"Information can also be submitted anonymously, via Crimestoppers, by calling 0800 555 111."
