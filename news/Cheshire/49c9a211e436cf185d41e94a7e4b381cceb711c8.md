**A man has been charged following a collision in Widnes that has left a 13-year-old girl from the town in hospital with serious injuries.**

Stuart Magee, of Hayes Avenue in Prescot, Knowsley, Merseyside, was arrested in Blackpool at around 5.15pm on Saturday 27 March.

The 33-year-old has subsequently been charged with causing serious injury by dangerous driving, failing to stop after a collision and failing to report a collision.

The charges relate to an incident involving a car and a pedestrian in Widnes that occurred shortly before 1pm on Saturday 27 March.

The pedestrian sustained serious injuries as a result of the collision and was taken Alder Hey Children's Hospital in an ambulance after being assessed by paramedics.

The teenage girl remains in a serious condition in the hospital receiving treatment.

Magee appeared at Warrington Magistrates' Court on Monday 29 March.

He was remanded in custody and is set to appear at Liverpool Crown Court on Monday 26 April.

A 32-year-old woman from Prescot has also been arrested in connection with the collision.

Arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, she has been released under investigation pending further enquiries after being interviewed in custody.
