**Officers are appealing for information from members of the public after a closed down pub was set on fire in Warrington.**

The arson attack at the Fiddle I'th Bag Inn on Alder Lane occurred on Sunday 8 March.

Firefighters were informed of the fire at the disused pub shortly before 12.30pm.

They were able to extinguish the fire but not before it caused extensive damage to the building.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and officers are urging anyone with any information or footage that may help their investigation to get in touch.

Sergeant Upile Mtitimila, of Warrington Local Policing Unit, said: "A fire investigator has confirmed that the fire was started deliberately.

"The closed down pub sustained extensive smoke and fire damage as a result of the arson attack, but the consequences of the incident could have been far worse.

"We believe that various people/groups have been using the building since the pub closed down.

"Thankfully, no-one was in the building when the fire took hold and firefighters were able to extinguish the fire before it had chance to spread to the exterior of the building and beyond.

"Fire spreads quickly and can endanger lives as well as properties.

"I would like to reassure members of the community that this is believed to be an isolated incident and we are determined to establish who started the fire and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"Enquiries are ongoing and as part of our investigation we want to speak to anyone who was in the area between 9.30am and 12.30pm on Sunday 8 March and witnessed anything suspicious.

"We also want to hear from anyone who thinks they may know who started the fire, or have mobile phone, CCTV or dashcam footage of them."

Anyone with information or footage that may aid the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 655828, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
