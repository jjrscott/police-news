Detectives investigating a burglary on Queens Road, Chester, which occurred on Thursday 10 September, have charged two men.

Following questioning the pair have since been charged with burglary and theft of a motor vehicle.

Rodham has also been charged with dangerous driving, driving without insurance and driving without a licence.

Rodham, of no fixed abode, and Jones, of Berwick Road West, Little Sutton, have both been remanded in custody and are due to appear at Warrington Magistrates' Court on Monday 14 September.
