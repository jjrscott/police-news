Officers are appealing for information following reports of racial abuse towards a woman and a girl in Macclesfield.

At around 6.15pm on Friday 5 June four people were walking on Market Street when an unknown male approached them.

He began racially abusing two members of the group, a woman and young girl, before walking off towards Hibel Road.

The male is white, around 50 years-of-age, 5'10" and of a slim build with grey hair and a long grey beard.

At the time of the incident, he was wearing a grey hoodie and blue jeans.

Anyone with information that could help officers with their investigation is urged to get in touch.

Police Constable Jarrad Sainsbury said: "Several enquiries are ongoing into this incident and we are doing everything possible to track down those responsible.

"We'd like to speak to anyone who was in the Market Street area at the time of the incident and anyone who believes that they may be able to give us more details about the offender.

"There would have been several people around the area at the time of this incident.

"Anyone with information is urged to get in touch by calling Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 723093 or report it to us via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report/ ."
