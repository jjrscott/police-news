**Detectives are appealing for information and witnesses after an assault in Warrington.**

At around 12.10am on Saturday 12 December officers received a report that two men had been injured during an assault on Crown Street.

The victims attended hospital with minor injuries.

It is believed that the suspects, two men, were in possession of a BB gun.

The suspects are described as white, aged between 20 to 30 years old and were wearing black puffa jackets at the time of the incident.

Detectives are now appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the incident or may have information that could help with their enquiries.

Detective Constable Caroline Wharmby said: "This is believed to be an isolated incident and I would like to reassure the public that we are doing all we can to find those responsible.

"A number of enquiries are currently underway and patrols are being conducted in the local area.

"I would urge anyone who may have been in the Crown Street area at the time of the incident, who may have seen or heard anything that could help us with our enquiries to get in touch.

"The same goes for anyone who may have caught dashcam or CCTV footage around the area."

Anyone with information is urged to call Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 871624 or report it via our website.

Information can also be passed on to Crimestoppers anonymously via 0800 555 111 or via the Crimestoppers website.
