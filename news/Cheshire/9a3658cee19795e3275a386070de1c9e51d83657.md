**A 19-year-old man has been charged following an attempted robbery in Rudheath.**

Jack Joynson, of Middlewich Road, Northwich, appeared at Warrington Magistrates' Court on Thursday 2 July, via a video link, to answer charges of attempted robbery and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place.

The charges relate to an incident at a Post Office in Wright Avenue, Rudheath.

Nothing was stolen during the incident, which occurred at around 6.50pm on Monday 22 June.

A Post Office worker sustained a minor injury to his arm during the incident. He did not require hospital treatment.

Joynson has been remanded in custody and is set to appear at Chester Crown Court, via a video link, on Thursday 30 July.

Two other people - a 33-year-old man from the Northwich area and a 17-year-old boy from Winsford - have been arrested in connection with the incident.

They have since been released on conditional bail.
