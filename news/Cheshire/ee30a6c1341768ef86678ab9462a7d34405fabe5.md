**Officers are appealing for information from members of the public after a 75-year-old woman from Widnes had her bag snatched in the town.**

The victim was walking at the junction of Haig Road and Henderson Road when the incident occurred shortly before 8.15am on Wednesday 22 July.

After following her along Haig Road, the man grabbed her bag from behind and ran off with it towards Mottershead Road.

A 31-year-old man from Widnes has been arrested in connection with the incident.

After being interviewed in custody, he has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Police Constable Dan Butler, of Widnes Local Policing Unit, said: "The incident understandably left the victim shaken up.

"We are determined to establish who snatched her bag, have it returned to her and make the thief face the consequences of his actions.

"As part of our ongoing enquiries we want to speak to anyone who was in the area and saw anything that may aid our investigation.

"Perhaps you witnessed the incident or saw the offender, either before he snatched the bag or as he was fleeing the scene.

"We also want to hear from anyone who believes they may have CCTV or dashcam footage of the offender."

Anyone with information or footage that may be relevant to the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 760804, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
