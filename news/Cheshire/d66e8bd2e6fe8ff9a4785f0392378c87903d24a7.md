Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after offenders targeted a cash machine in Woolston.

Sometime between 12.20am and 12.30am on Wednesday 26 February unknown offenders gained access to a shop on Holes Lane and stole money from a cash machine inside.

They then fled the area, leaving a white Ford Transit van at the scene.

Detectives are now appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident or may have information to come forward.

Detective Sergeant Tom Hall said: "The investigation is currently in the early stages and we are following several lines of enquiry.

"We are doing all that we can to trace those responsible and are keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the incident, may have seen the van before the burglary or saw any other vehicles leaving the area at around 12.30am.

"I also want to speak to anyone who has CCTV or may have caught dashcam footage of the offenders arriving or fleeing the scene.

"The same goes to anyone who may have any information which can lead us to bring those responsible to justice."

Anyone with information is asked to call Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 646518 or report it via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report/

Alternatively, information can be passed on to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
