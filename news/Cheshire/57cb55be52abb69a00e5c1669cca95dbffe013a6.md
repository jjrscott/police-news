Detectives investigating four burglaries in one week at houses in Runcorn are urging the public to be vigilant and appealing for information.

Between Monday 6 January and Monday 13 January homes on Norton Lane, Goldcrest Close, Halton Brow and The Uplands were targeted by burglars either during the day or during the evening.

Once inside offenders have ransacked the house and stolen jewellery or cash from inside.

Officers believe all the burglaries are linked and are encouraging the public to take extra security measures as a precaution to help keep your home secure.

• Close and double lock all doors and windows
• Set your burglar alarm
• Make sure all valuables are out of sight
• In the evening, shut the curtains and leave lights on

Detective Sergeant Rob McLoughlin, of Runcorn Local Policing Unit, said: "Being burgled can be a distressing crime and while we continue with our investigation I want to take this opportunity to remind people to remain vigilant and take extra home security measures.

"We are currently following a number of lines of enquiry however, I am also keen to hear from anyone who may have seen people acting suspiciously around these areas or have information which could help the investigation, to get in touch.

"I am also keen to see if anyone noticed any vehicles near to the shop to come forward. If you have dashcam footage please submit it through to us."
