**Detectives investigating a high-level drugs conspiracy have arrested seven people in dawn raids.**

The arrests follow an 18-month operation into an organised crime group allegedly supplying class A and B drugs to other gangs in Warrington.

Today, Wednesday 9 September, Cheshire Police's Serious and Organised Crime Unit arrested four men, aged 29, 38, 40 and 51, and three women, aged 34, 36 and 62 on suspicion of conspiracy to supply cocaine and cannabis.

The warrants took place at addresses in Heather Close in Warrington, Brindley Avenue in Warrington, Regency Park in Widnes, Camomile Close in Merseyside, Graylands Road in Merseyside, Aviemore Road in Merseyside and Breccia Gardens in Merseyside.

All seven are now waiting to be questioned by police.

Detective Chief Inspector Giles Pierce, from the Serious and Organised Crime Unit, said: "This conspiracy came to our attention following previous investigations into two organised crime gangs in Warrington - codenamed Operation Samurai and Operation Dreadnought.

"Those arrested are suspected of being part of a well-established organised crime group who we believe were operating at a high level across the North West.

"It is a massively significant result in our determination to disrupt organised crime gangs operating from Warrington and supplying these drugs further afield."

During the strike police seized a car, designer items, jewellery and weapons.

DCI Pierce added: "If a criminal is suspected of operating a drugs enterprise they are likely to gain substantial profit and might display their riches in public.

"It is important people in the community learn to recognise those who could be living above their means and showing an increase in wealth, and report it to police."

Police and Crime Commissioner for Cheshire David Keane said: "Drugs have a huge impact on our community and blight our neighbourhoods, causing misery to victims.

"This operation is another example of the Serious and Organised Crime Unit once again pursuing gangs believed to be involved in the supply of drugs."

"I remain proud of their hard work and determination in disrupting this crime and their continued efforts to protect our communities.

If you believe someone living in your community could be involved in serious and organised crime please report it.
