Two men have been arrested in Liverpool in connection with a shooting in Warrington.

The 23-year-old and 25-year-old were arrested at around 7am on Wednesday 6 May on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder.

Police are searching three addresses on Eldersfield Road, Netherfield Road South and Stonedale Crescent as part of ongoing enquiries.

The arrests follow an incident at around 8.50pm on Friday 24 April when a number of shots were fired outside an address on Poplars Avenue in Orford.
