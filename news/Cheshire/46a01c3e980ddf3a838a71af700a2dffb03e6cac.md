Police investigating a sexual assault at Chester bus station would like to speak to a good Samaritan who may have vital information.

Following the attack, the woman spoke to the 16-year-old girl, who was visibly distressed, and handed her a note with her number, which she has since lost so we can't get in touch with her.

The teenager had been sitting at the bus station between 7.50pm and 9.20pm on 1 June when a man sat beside her. At some point the man sexually assaulted the teenager.

DC Faye Taylor said: "As part of our enquiries we have been looking at CCTV and have seen that a woman who was on the number one Liverpool bus at 9pm that night spoke to the young victim who was visibly distressed.

"The woman got on the same bus at Upper Northgate Street and had a conversation with her. She passed her number to her, but the victim has since lost the number. I would urge you to please contact me. You have not done anything at all wrong, we just need to speak to you so that we can progress with our enquiries - you may have valuable information. Please call me on 101 quoting IML 719979."

As part of enquiries a 33-year-old man has been arrested and released on bail pending further enquiries.

Anyone with information should contact Cheshire police on 101 or via (link) quoting IML 719979. Alternatively information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
