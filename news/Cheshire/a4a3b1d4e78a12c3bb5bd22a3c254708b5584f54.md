**A 34-year-old man from Salford in Greater Manchester who was arrested in the Netherlands has been extradited to the UK.**

Jamie Rothwell was brought back to Cheshire by the National Extradition Unit on Thursday 11 March. He appeared at Warrington Magistrates Court the following day after being charged with firearm and drug offences.

Rothwell was arrested on 14 December 2020 as he travelled in a taxi in Amsterdam after Cheshire Constabulary's Serious and Organised Crime Unit obtained a European Arrest Warrant.

Detectives worked with the National Crime Agency, North West Regional and Organised Crime Unit and Dutch partners along with assistance from the Crown Prosecution Service to secure the arrest and his subsequent extradition.

Rothwell has been remanded in custody and is due to appear at Liverpool Crown Court on Friday 9 April 2021.
