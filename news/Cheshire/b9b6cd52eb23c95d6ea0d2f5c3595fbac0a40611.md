Police in Widnes are appealing for witnesses following an aggravated burglary in the town.

At 9.15pm on 27 September five men forced their way into an address in Marcien Way in Widnes.

The men, one armed with a screwdriver, demanded money and jewellery from the two occupants before searching the house and making off with jewellery and a wallet. The suspects are believed to have made off in a red VW Golf.

The five men were dressed all in black and were wearing black gloves and balaclavas.

DC Nicola Dolan said: "Thankfully the victims were not injured, but were left shaken by their ordeal.

"I would urge you to contact police if you saw suspicious activity around the time of the incident or if you have any information that may help our investigation.

"That also goes for anyone who was in the area and may have dashcam footage that may help us."

Anyone with information should contact Cheshire Police on 101 or via www.cheshire.police.uk quoting IML 815222. Alternatively information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
