Residents across Cheshire are being invited to have their say on the use of Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology in policing.

ANPR technology is used by police forces and law enforcement agencies to help detect, deter and disrupt criminality, including tackling travelling criminals, Organised Crime Groups and Terrorists and to protect vulnerable people.

The system uses a network of cameras situated on the road network across the country which record the details of all passing vehicles, including those of vehicles that are not known to be of interest at the time of the read that may in appropriate circumstances be accessed for investigative purposes.

This data provides officers with vital lines of enquiry and evidence in the investigation of crime.

Chief Superintendent Martin Cleworth said: "The data provided by the ANPR system is totally invaluable and has proved vital in a number of major investigations, ranging from murders and organised crime gangs to burglaries and missing people.

"However, when using such a system it is essential that we seek the views and experiences of the general public, to help ensure that we are able to deliver a meaningful strategy for the use of ANPR in policing.

"I would urge residents across the county to log-on and complete this short on-line survey to help us determine how ANPR technology in used in future. The survey will only take a couple of minutes to complete and it could make a real difference. "

Anyone looking to take part is urged to visit the ANPR survey.
