Don't let Christmas come early for burglars. This is the message being given by Cheshire Police in the run-up to the festive season to help keep people and their homes safe.

We all think about making our home look nice for Christmas by putting presents around the tree. We may also store larger items such as bikes and toys in garages and sheds out of the way of inquisitive eyes, but we don't think beyond this and enough about home security. For some it's just not on our radar and we think it will never happen to us.

This festive season view your property in the way a burglar would to check your homes security and that it is sufficient. Do everything and anything you can to stop your home from being targeted.

Detective Chief Inspector Simon Draco said: "The last thing we want anyone to suffer is a visit from a burglar, especially at this time of year so let's make Santa the only person sneaking into your home this Christmas and prioritise home security.

"We will be working hard to keep everyone safe over the season but there are steps you can take to help us. Avoid putting presents under the tree until the last possible moment and don't group them together as this will make easy "shopping" for a burglar.

"Think about what you put out on social media and refrain from promoting that you are away and that your home is empty. If you go away then automate your lights, fit a smart doorbell, which alerts you to a caller and check your outside lighting is working before you leave. All these steps will make your home less appealing to a criminal and safe you the heartache that comes with a theft."

There will be lots of safety advice and guidance being delivered through a combination of videos, gifs and images this Christmas.
