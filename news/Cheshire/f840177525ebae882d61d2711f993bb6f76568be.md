**Two men from Winsford who broke into a flat in the town and threatened the occupant have been jailed.**

Harry Ellwood, 23, and Lewis Courtney, 19, both appeared at Chester Crown Court on Monday 18 November where they were sentenced to a total of more than five years in prison.

Ellwood, of no fixed address, was handed a three year prison sentence after pleading guilty to robbery and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place.

Courtney, of Newell Crescent, Winsford, admitted a charge of robbery and was jailed for two years and three months.

At around 5am on Wednesday 24 July Ellwood and Courtney, along with an unknown man, were captured on CCTV footage breaking into a flat in Crook Lane, Wharton, Winsford.

Ellwood threatened the victim with a hammer before his television was stolen.

Following sentencing, Detective Constable Paul Cundy of Northwich CID said: "This was a terrifying ordeal for the victim and his girlfriend who were asleep in bed when the three men broke in to their flat and made threats with a hammer.

"I hope the fact that Ellwood and Courtney are now behind bars facing the consequences of their actions provides the victims with some closure, and enables them to move forward with their lives.

"The local community should be reassured that incidents of this type are rare in Cheshire, and that we will do everything within our powers to place suspects before the courts."
