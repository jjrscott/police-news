Police are advising residents in Sandbach to be vigilant following a number of thefts in Ettiley Heath and Elworth.

Residents in the area have woken up this morning (14 May) to discover they had been targeted by thieves overnight.

A silver Lexus was stolen from an address in Ettiley Avenue and a garage at another address had been broken into. Nothing had been stolen but two bikes from the shed were found in a neighbouring bush.

In Elton Road a car had been entered, but it wasn't clear if anything had been taken, while a house had been entered in Blakemere Way and a handbag and watches were stolen.

DC Scott Bowater said: "While we are investigating the thefts, I'd urge people to make sure their homes and cars are fully locked and secure. Keep valuables out of reach and look out for suspicious activity. Contact police if you see anything that doesn't seem right."

Anyone with information on the thefts or has dashcam footage or CCTV footage that may help should contact Cheshire Police on 101 or via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report/ quoting IML 704430.

Alternatively information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 55 111.
