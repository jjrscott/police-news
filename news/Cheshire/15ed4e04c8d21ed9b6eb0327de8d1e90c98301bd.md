**Officers investigating a robbery in Congleton are appealing for information from members of the public.**

At around 4.30pm on Monday 29 June an unknown man entered Mossley Pharmacy on Biddulph Road and pushed a woman working there away from the till as she was cashing up.

He then stole a quantity of cash from the till before fleeing on foot in the direction of Cross Lane and Congleton Railway Station.

The offender is described as white, around 5' 9" tall with a slim build.

He was carrying a grey rucksack with an orange top handle, shoulder straps and piping and was wearing a grey hooded jacket with the hood up, a blue face mask, olive green tracksuit bottoms and black trainers with red lining/soles.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and officers are urging anyone with any information or CCTV or dashcam footage that may aid their investigation to get in touch.

PC Stone said: "Thankfully the woman working in the pharmacy was not injured as a result of the incident, but the robbery has understandably left her extremely shaken up.

"I would like to reassure the community that this is believed to be an isolated incident and we are determined to establish who carried out the robbery and bring him to justice.

"Enquiries are ongoing and as part of our investigation we want to speak to anyone who was in the area and believes they may have seen the offender, either before he entered the pharmacy or as he was fleeing the scene.

"We also want to hear from anyone who thinks they may know who the offender is, or have CCTV or dashcam footage of him."

Anyone with information or footage that may help investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 742443, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
