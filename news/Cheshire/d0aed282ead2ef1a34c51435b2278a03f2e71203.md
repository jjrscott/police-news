**Two 15-year-old boys have been charged following a series of robbery incidents in Widnes and Warrington.**

The teenagers, who cannot be named for legal reasons, have been remanded in custody and are set to appear at Warrington Youth Court on Friday 6 March.

One of the boys is from Runcorn and the other is from Warrington. They have both been charged with three counts of robbery and one count of attempted robbery.

The robbery charges relate to incidents at:

 * M&S Late Shop on Derby Road, Widnes, on Saturday 8 February
 * Peel House Fish Bar, Peel House Lane, Widnes, on Saturday 8 February
 * A path off Benson Road, Warrington, on Wednesday 4 March, in which a 72-year-old woman from Warrington had her bag stolen.

The attempted robbery charge relates to another incident in Warrington on Wednesday 4 March.

The mobile phone of a 26-year-old man from St Helens was targeted in that incident, which occurred in Birchwood Way.

â€‹Both of the boys have also been charged with possession of an offensive weapon in a public place in relation to the robbery at the M&S Late Shop in Widnes.

They have been released on conditional bail and are set to appear at Warrington Youth Court on Wednesday 11 March.
