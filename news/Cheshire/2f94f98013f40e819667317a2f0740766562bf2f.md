A 37-year-old man who repeatedly targeted cars to fund his drug habit has been jailed for more than three years.

Jason Burke, of no fixed abode but from Northwich, was sentenced at Chester Crown Court on Thursday 23 April.

Appearing via video link, Burke was jailed for three years and six months after pleading guilty to the offences at an earlier hearing. He must also pay a victim surcharge of Â£181.

The court heard how Burke, between Sunday 8 March and Tuesday 10 March 2020, began a crime spree, committing up to ten offences of thefts from insecure cars.

These incidents took place in David Street, Rosemary Drive, Northway, Naylor Court, Flower Street, Romanes Street, Queensgate and Penrhyn Road.

Following a CCTV appeal, Burke was arrested and cautioned on Tuesday 10 March.

On Wednesday 11 March, Burke was charged with one count of burglary, seven thefts from motor vehicles and three counts of vehicle interference.

Following the charges, Burke admitted to a further six thefts from cars to fund his drug habit.

He also admitted that on 6 November 2019, he had gained access to an insecure vehicle on Beeston Street and managed to enter a property by using keys he found in a car.

He then stole cash from the property.

Constable Matthew Uren of Northwich Local Policing Unit said: "This was a great result for the Northwich Beat team following a CCTV appeal into a spate of thefts from cars across the town.

"I am pleased that Burke is behind bars for these offences and I hope that the result acts as a deterrent to those who think they can get away with this type of crime.

"Members of the public have the right to feel safe in their own homes and for their property to be safe and offences like this cause great upset.

"I would also like to take the time to remind people to remain vigilant and always ensure that their vehicles and homes are secure to make it as difficult as possible for criminals to target them.

"Cheshire Constabulary will do everything in its powers to target those who commit offences such as this and bring them to justice.
