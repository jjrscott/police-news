**Detectives investigating an altercation in Widnes which left two 16-year-old boys with serious injuries are appealing for information and footage from members of the public.**

The incident involving a group of males occurred on Kingsway, near to Riverside College, at around 2.50pm on Monday 3 February.

The two 16-year-old boys, who are both from Merseyside, sustained puncture wounds as a result of the incident and were taken to hospital in ambulances.

One of them has since been discharged after receiving treatment.

The other remains in hospital. His condition is described as stable.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone with any information or dashcam footage that may help their investigation to get in touch.

Detective Inspector Ian Whiley, of Widnes Local Policing Unit (LPU), said: "We are determined to establish exactly what has happened and who was responsible.

"We are in the very early stages of our investigation into the incident and enquiries are ongoing.

"As part of our enquiries we want to speak to anyone who was in the Kingsway area around the time of the incident and believes they may have witnessed something that may be relevant to our investigation.

"Perhaps you saw what happened or the people involved.

"We believe that passing motorists may have witnessed the incident. If you were driving along Kingsway and saw, or have dashcam footage of, anything that may help our investigation please contact the team here at Widnes Police Station.

"The same goes for anyone who believes they may know the identities of people involved in the altercation."

Widnes LPU Inspector Catherine Pritchard added: "I would like to reassure residents, who will understandably be concerned about what has happened, that this appears to be an isolated incident and there is not believed to be any risk to the wider community.

"Additional patrols remain in the area to provide reassurance and anyone with any concerns is asked to speak to an officer."

No arrests have been made in connection with the incident at the current time.

Anyone with any information or dashcam footage that may aid detectives with their investigation is urged to contact Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 627919, or give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about.
