Four women arrested by Cheshire police officers after a series of warrants were executed in Greater Manchester have been charged fraud offences.

Emmiline Burdon, 29, Lyndsey Burdon, 36, Sarah Burdon, 40, and Sonia Malhi, 37, were all arrested on Wednesday 13 May as part of an investigation co-ordinated by detectives from Macclesfield and Northwich Beat teams and well as officers from Merseyside's fraud unit.

The detectives were supported by Cheshire Constabulary's Economic Crime Unit.

Emmiline Burdon, of Riverdale Road, Manchester; Lyndsey Burdon, of Brynorme Road, Manchester; Sarah Burdon, of Evesham Road, Manchester; and Malhi, of Hobson Crescent, Audenshaw, Greater Manchester; have all subsequently been charged with conspiracy to commit fraud along with a number of other offences.

All four women have been remanded in custody and are set to appear at Warrington Magistrates' Court on Thursday 14 May.

The charges relate to allegations of the fraudulent usage of stolen bank details that were allegedly used to purchase items at stores in Cheshire, Merseyside, Lancashire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester and Derbyshire.
