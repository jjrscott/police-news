Officers are appealing for witnesses following an attempted robbery in Knutsford.

At 3.45pm on 7 July a 15-year-old boy was walking along an alleyway off Stanley Road when another teenager approached and punched him. He tried to take his rucksack but the boy managed to run off to safety.

The suspect is described as approximately 16 to 17 years old with dirty blonde straw coloured hair with a fringe down to his eyebrows. He had very short patchy facial hair on his chin and is around 6ft tall.

He was wearing a silver chain around his neck made of links, a light grey hoodie, with the hood up, and a Gilet on top.

The Gilet was a matte black colour and of a puffer style. He was also wearing light grey or white joggers.

Police Constable Luke Rose of Macclesfield Local Policing Unit (LPU) said: "The teenager suffered a minor injury to his face and was left understandably shaken by his ordeal.

"I'd urge anyone who recognises the description of the suspect or may have seen the offender in the area around the time of the incident to contact Macclesfield LPU so we can bring this male to justice."

Anyone with information should contact Cheshire Police on 101 or via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report/ quoting IML 748863.

Alternatively, information can be passed on to Crimestoppers anonymously via 0800 555 111 or https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
