A drug dealer who tried to escape from police as they raided his flat in Barnton has been sentenced to 42 months.

Forty two-year-old Andros Kokas, of Blackcroft Avenue, attempted to flee through his bedroom window when officers executed a warrant at his home on Thursday 9 May 2019.

Following a search of the flat, an amount of cocaine was found in a game case on the bed along with 18 small wraps of black plastic, weights and a mobile phone. A dealers list was also located in the flat and seized by officers.

On Monday 13 January at Chester Crown Court Kokas was sent to prison after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing to possession with intent to supply cocaine.

PC Terry Boyle, of Northwich Local Policing Unit, said: "Due to the local community coming forward to report Kokas's drug activity we were able to take action. This has resulted in Kokas being put behind bars and it has also disrupted his supply of cocaine.

"Information like this is vitally important in helping us to protect our community. I want to keep encouraging the public to spot the signs of drug dealing and to get in touch with us knowing that we will act on the information that is provided."
