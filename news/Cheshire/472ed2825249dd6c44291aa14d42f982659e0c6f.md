**Officers are appealing for information following a collision involving a pedestrian in Crewe.**

Just before 12.45am on Sunday 30 August, a 33-year-old man was walking near the junction of West Street and Vernon Way, when he was involved in a collision with a white Peugeot van.

The vehicle then drove off towards the direction of West Street.

As a result of the collision, the man sustained serious injuries and was taken to hospital.

The van was subsequently found abandoned on Parkers Road later that day.

Officers are now appealing for anyone with information about the incident to come forward.

Sergeant David Harrison said: "This is an extremely serious incident which could have had a devastating consequence.

"A number of enquiries are currently underway and we are doing all we can to find those responsible.

"I would ask anyone who knows who is responsible to come forward and also urge anyone who may have seen the van on the lead up to or after the collision in West Street and the surrounding areas to get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to call Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 792939 or report it via the Cheshire Police website.

Information can also be passed on to Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 or report it via the website.
