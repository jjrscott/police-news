**Detectives investigating an incident in Warrington are appealing for information.**

On Wednesday 24 March a sexual offence occurred at a small park located between Wellington Street and Ellesmere Street in Warrington.

It involved a child who is believed to have been inappropriately touched by a man at some time between 6pm and 6.20pm.

The child told his mum what had happened and it was reported to police.

Officers have begun an investigation and are now conducting a number of lines of enquiry.

Detective Sergeant Darren Reid, from Warrington Local Policing Unit, said: "I understand how concerning this will be for the local community and I want to reassure you that there will be a visible policing presence in the area.

"Our investigation is underway and we are conducting enquiries including speaking to witnesses and reviewing CCTV footage.

"I am also appealing directly to the public to come forward with any information, or if you may have witnessed the incident and not yet spoken to police to get in touch.

"If you have CCTV footage overlooking the park or surrounding areas, please also make contact with us.

"If you have any concerns please speak to an officer."

Information can be provided by contacting Cheshire Police on 101 quoting IML 946546.
