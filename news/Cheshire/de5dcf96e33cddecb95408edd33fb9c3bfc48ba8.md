Police are appealing for witnesses following a burglary in Wistaston.

Sometime between 6.30am and 7.15am on Tuesday 7 April thieves gained entry to an address in Milne close. They made a search of the property before leaving with cash and jewellery.

DC Nicholas Jackson said: "The victim was understandably shaken after coming home to find someone had been in his house and stolen from him. I would urge anyone who was in the area between 6am and 7.30am and saw anyone acting suspiciously to contact police.

"If you have dashcam footage around these times or you have CCTV please have a look at it and tell us if you have captured any suspicious activity."

Anyone with information should contact DC Nicholas Jackson on 101 or via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report quoting IML 676637. Alternatively information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
