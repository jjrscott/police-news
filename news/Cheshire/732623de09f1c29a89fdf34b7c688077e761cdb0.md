**Updated statement regarding the ongoing investigation into a number of baby deaths and non-fatal collapses at the neonatal unit at The Countess of Chester Hospital.**

The Crown Prosecution Service has authorised Cheshire Police to charge a healthcare professional with murder in connection with an ongoing investigation into a number of baby deaths at the Countess of Chester Hospital.

Lucy Letby, of Arran Avenue, Hereford, is facing 8 charges of murder and 10 charges of attempted murder. The charges relate to the period of June 2015 to June 2016.

The 30-year-old was re-arrested on Tuesday 10 November and has since subsequently been charged.

She has been held in custody and is due to appear at Warrington Magistrates' Court on Thursday 12 November.

You are reminded that criminal proceedings against Lucy Letby are live and that she has a right to a fair trial. It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice ongoing proceedings.
