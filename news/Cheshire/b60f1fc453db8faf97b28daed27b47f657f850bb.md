Matthew's family have now paid tribute to him, they said: "On Tuesday 17 March we lost the most important person in our life,Matthew was a loving husband and father to his two boys.

"To those who knew Matthew, you will know how much of a wonderful and caring person he was.

"He thought the world of all of his family and would do anything for anyone, he did lots of charity work and fundraising.

"His pride and joy was his beloved chip ship in Northwich in fact he was 'Mr Codfather', he couldn't walk down the street in Northwich without someone stopping to say hello or for a chat!

"In the 12 years that the shop has been open, every year he would continuously improve and strive to become the best chip shop in the UK, recently winning The National Fish & Chip Awards for 2020 - all because of he cared so much.

"To those who have read online articles about the accident and that may have posted comments on social media platforms, please spare a thought for us as a family and also friends who knew Matthew.

"We would appreciate privacy at this time."
