Officers from Macclesfield CID are appealing for witnesses and dashcam footage following an attempted robbery in Congleton.

Shortly after 8am on Friday 7 February officers were called to reports that a man, armed with a hammer, had entered Hightown Post Office on Biddulph Road and threatened staff demanding they handed over money.

The staff members refused to cooperate with the man and he fled the scene empty handed.

The offender left the store on foot, turning left towards the train station. He was wearing a white helmet and yellow high-visibility jacket.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and officers are keen to hear from anyone with any information which may aid the investigation.

Detective Constable Helen Orr said; "Thankfully nobody was injured as a result of this incident, although the victims have been left shaken as a result of their ordeal.

"The investigation is currently in the very early stages and we are keen to hear from anyone with any information which may assist our enquiries.

"Biddulph Road is a busy road and I believe that at the time of the incident there could have been a number people in the area who may have seen what happened and I'd urge them to get in touch.

"The same goes for anyone who was driving in the area and believes they have any dashcam footage which may be relevant to the investigation."

Anyone who may have witnessed the incident or may have caught dashcam footage is urged to call 101 quoting IML 630582 or report it via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/ .

Alternatively, information can be reported to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or visit https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously .
