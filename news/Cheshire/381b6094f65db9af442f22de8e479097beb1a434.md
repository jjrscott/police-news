Police are appealing for information from the public after a pensioner was injured during a burglary in Ellesmere Port.

At around 7.45pm on Thursday 17 December the victim, a 76-year-old man, heard a knock at the front door of his home on Oldfield Road.

Upon opening the door the man was greeted by an unknown woman who barged her way into his home. The man has had previous contact with this woman however she is not known to him personally.

The woman then grabbed a number of bottles of alcohol from the house before fleeing the property.

The victim attempted to chase the woman as she left the address, during the process he fell to the floor causing him to hit his head.

The man was subsequently taken to hospital by ambulance, his injuries are not believed to be serious.

The woman is described as around 5' 6" tall and in her early twenties; she was wearing a black hooded jacked and jeans.

Detective Constable Phill Hunt, who is leading the investigation said: "The victim in this case has been left shaken as a result and we are doing all we can to trace the person responsible.

"This was a targeted incident and there is nothing to suggest that this woman presents any risk to the general public.

"Enquiries are ongoing and as part of our investigation we want to hear from anyone who believes they may have relevant information or footage in relation to the incident.

"Perhaps you were in the area and saw the offender, either before she entered the house or as she was fleeing the scene.

"Or maybe you have CCTV or dashcam footage that would assist with the investigation.

Anyone with information or footage that may aid the ongoing investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 876012, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
