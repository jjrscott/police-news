Police are appealing for witnesses after 14 puppies were stolen from an address in Northwich.

Sometime between 10pm on Tuesday 10 November and 7.20am the following morning the 14 cockerpoo and cockerspaniel puppies aged four weeks were taken after thieves forced entry into an outbuilding.

DC Paul Matchett said: "The puppies are too young to be taken from their mums so the owners are desperate for them to be returned as they could sadly die. It's also distressing for the dogs who will be missing their puppies.

"I'd urge anyone who has any information or is offered a puppy clearly too young to call us. A puppy shouldn't leave their mum until at least eight weeks old. You should also be able to see their mum when purchasing a puppy. Not seeing mum should raise alarm bells."

Anyone with information should contact Cheshire Police on 101 or via www.cheshire.police.uk quoting IML 849170. Alternatively information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
