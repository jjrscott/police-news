**Detectives investigating a burglary in Widnes are appealing for information and footage from members of the public.**

Between 6.30pm and 8.15pm on Tuesday 3 December a house was broken into in Leigh Avenue whilst the homeowners were out.

The offenders stole a quantity of jewellery and cash, as well as the two cars parked outside.

They then fled in the vehicles.

One of the cars stolen, a light blue Audi TT Turbo convertible, was found abandoned in Aire in Widnes at around 1am on Wednesday 4 December.

The other, a blue Ford Focus Zetec estate, remains outstanding.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone with information or footage that may aid their investigation to come forward.

Detective Sergeant Roberts, of Widnes Local Policing Unit, said: "Burglary is a serious offence in which victims are targeted in their own home, which is the place they should be able to feel most safe.

"We are determined to establish who carried out the burglary in Leigh Avenue and make them face the consequences of their actions.

"Enquiries are ongoing and we want to speak to anyone who believes they may have seen or have footage of the burglars, either before or after they before they broke into the house and stole the victims' cars.

"We also want to hear from anyone who thinks they may know who the burglars are or have information regarding the whereabouts of the stolen Ford Focus."

Anyone with information or footage that may be relevant to the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 580142, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
