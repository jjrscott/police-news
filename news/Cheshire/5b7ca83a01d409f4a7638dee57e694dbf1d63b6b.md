**A 55-year-old man from Northwich has been charged with murder in connection with the death of a pensioner in the town.**

Gary Soloman, of Castle Court, was originally arrested in October following the death of John Hammerton. He was released on conditional bail pending further enquires.

John, who was 72, was found dead at his home in Peckforton Way, Castle, on Tuesday 8 October.

Soloman was rearrested on Tuesday 25 February.

He has subsequently been charged with murder.

Soloman has also been charged with three counts of fraud and two counts of theft.

He has been remanded in custody and is set to appear at Crewe Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 26 February.
