**Officers investigating a fatal collision near Chester have renewed their appeal for information.**

The collision involving a heavy goods vehicle and a pedestrian occurred on the A41 Whitchurch Road in Chowley at around 4.40am on Friday 7 August.

Officers attended the scene and discovered that the pedestrian, a woman in her 40s from the Chester area, had sustained serious injuries.

Sadly, she died at the scene.

Her family have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers.

The driver of the HGV, a 49-year-old man from Beechwood, Merseyside, is not believed to have sustained any injuries as a result of the collision.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing.

The enquiries carried out so far make officers believe that the pedestrian was involved in an earlier collision on the A41, further north near Dragon Hall.

She is believed to have got out of a damaged black Peugeot car and made her way to the second collision location on foot.

Anyone who witnessed either collision or believes that they saw the woman walking along the road in the early hours of Friday 7 August is asked to call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 773654, or give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report.

The same goes for anyone who thinks they have dashcam footage that may be relevant to the ongoing investigation.
