**Detectives investigating the death of a man following a serious assault in Warrington are trying to trace a potential witness.**

Officers believe the man may have seen the incident unfolding shortly after 10am on Thursday 2 July but has not yet been spoken to by police.

The incident occurred at Gateway Trade Park, Kerfoot Street, Warrington.

Officers attended the scene and found a 51-year-old man with serious injuries, sadly Andrew Webster from Warrington died days later in hospital.

The man is described as white with a greying beard and dark hair. He was wearing dark blue zip up jacket and a dark blue t-shirt with a lighter coloured logo across the chest.

DI Adam Waller said: "The man is seen on CCTV walking across the car park in the direction of Screwfix at 10am, waiting near to the entrance to the store while the police and ambulance service are treating Mr Webster, before leaving up to half an hour later. I'd like to appeal directly to the man as well as anyone who recognises his description to contact us on 101 or via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/ quoting IML 744483.

"I'd like to reassure this man that he's not in any trouble, it's important that we speak to everyone who was there that day as part of our investigation and I believe this man may have seen all or part of this incident."

As part of enquiries into the circumstances a 24-year-old man was arrested and has since been released on bail pending further enquiries.
