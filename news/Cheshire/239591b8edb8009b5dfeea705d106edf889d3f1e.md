Police in Northwich are appealing for information following an assault on a teenage girl in a park in the town.

Shortly after 9pm on Sunday 3 January three teenage girls were sitting on a bench in Verdin Park, Northwich overlooking Castle Street, when they were approached by an unknown man. The girls started to walk off as he approached.

One of the girls was then assaulted before they were chased out of the main entrance of the park, where the girls then ran out on to Castle Street, before running across the town bridge near the Bull Ring. The girl was not injured but they were left shocked and distressed by the incident.

The man is described as white, aged 30-40years old, approximately 6ft tall, with a long light coloured beard. He was wearing a black beanie style hat, black fleece zipped coat and a long red skirt down to his ankles that appeared to have a pattern on.

A man of similar description has done similar offences in Northwich and Macclesfield over the last few months.

Sergeant Andy Cooper said: "This man's behaviour is of concern and we have been making every effort to identify the person responsible. The offences have been sporadic, but we have had three reported cases now in 12 months.

"Whilst conducting our enquiries we have identified a man who may have witnessed the girls running out of the park on the night. We are keen to speak with him as he may have valuable information that could help us with our investigation."

Anyone with information should contact Cheshire Police on 101 or via www.cheshire.police.uk quoting IML 887990. Alternatively information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

If you see anyone matching the description acting suspiciously, or have any information on who this may be, contact us on 101, 999 if a crime is taking place.
