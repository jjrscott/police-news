Officers investigating an assault at a public house in Winsford are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At around 5.30pm on Sunday 19 January a 35-year-old woman was involved in an altercation with a man on the car park outside the Brighton Belle on Middlewich Road.

During the incident a number of threats were made towards the woman and she was also physically assaulted.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and officers are appealing for anyone who was in the area and witnessed the incident get in touch.

Police Constable Robert Tandy said: "The victim in this case was left shaken as a result of the incident and we are committed to doing all we can to establish exactly what took place.

"The assault took place on a busy Sunday afternoon, shortly after the Liverpool v Manchester United match had finished, and we know there were a large number of people present.

"Enquiries are ongoing and I urge anyone who was in the area and saw anything that may aid our investigation to come forward.

"The same goes for any motorists who were at the pub and have any dashcam footage of the incident."

Anyone with information or footage that may help the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 616245, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

A 38-year-old local man has been arrested on suspicion of assault in connection with the incident; he has been released on conditional bail pending further enquiries.
