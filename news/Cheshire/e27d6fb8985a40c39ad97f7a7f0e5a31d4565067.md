Detectives from Northwich CID have arrested five people on suspicion of fraud offences.

The two men, age 25 and 39, and three women, age 24, 28 and 29, were all arrested this morning (Wednesday 3 March) at addresses in Winsford and Weaverham.

All five have been held on suspicion of conspiracy to commit fraud and fraud by false representation.

The arrests relate to the alleged fraudulent sale of vehicles.

Detective Sergeant Rob Astbury said: "This morning's arrests are part of an ongoing investigation into the alleged fraudulent sale of vehicles in Cheshire and further afield.

"Enquiries in relation to these incidents remain ongoing and the five people arrested today have now been released under investigation pending further enquiries."

David Keane, Police and Crime Commissioner for Cheshire said: "This morning's arrests show that tackling fraud is a priority for Cheshire Police and I would like to thanks all of the officers in the investigation.

"Fraud is an extremely serious offence and I hope that this ongoing investigation provides reassurance and acts as a warning to anyone planning to commit such offences."

Anyone planning on buying a car online is urged to be extremely careful and never pay a deposit before you have seen the vehicle.
