**A 54-year-old man has been jailed for three years for drug offences after heroin with an estimated street value of Â£1,360 was seized during a warrant in Neston.**

Kevin Bennion, of Drake Road, was arrested with being concerned in supply of class A (heroin) and subsequently charged with possession with intent to supply class A following a warrant at an address in the town.

During the raid officers recovered a quantity of heroin, cash and mobile phones.

Bennion was remanded in custody, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years imprisonment at Warrington Magistrates Court on Thursday 23 July.

Sergeant Kevin Green, of Ellesmere Port Beat Management Team, said: "I hope that this result shows that we will not stop when pursuing those responsible for drug dealing in our neighbourhoods and we will always act on information provided by local communities.

"I am glad that we have prevented these drugs from reaching the streets of Neston but our fight against those who blight our neighbourhood with illegal drugs continues.

"We will do everything our power to stamp out illegal drug activity and I am urging anyone with any concerns about dealing in their local area to call Cheshire Police on 101 or report it via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report."

Police and Crime Commissioner David Keane said: "This result is a great example of how officers are doing everything they can to put an end to illegal drug activity across Cheshire.

"This sentence should be a warning to those who are involved in this type of criminal activity and believe that they are beyond the law.

"As police and crime commissioner I will be working with the chief constable to ensure officers continue their efforts in tracking down and bringing these criminals to justice."
