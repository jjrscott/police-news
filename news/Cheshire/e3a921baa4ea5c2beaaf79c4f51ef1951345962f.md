Detectives are appealing for information after a confrontation between two men on Forshaw Street in Warrington earlier this morning (11 December).

At around 7.20am this morning, police were called after two men were seen in an old silver Mercedes Saloon car fighting on Battersby Lane.

The silver Mercedes was parked up and was blocking the road, until a van driver beeped their horn as the car was holding up traffic. The car then moved on, travelling left onto Forshaw Street, where the vehicle parked up in the middle of the road with both doors open.

The two men from the vehicle began to fight each other in the street before one of the men was seen being dragged back towards the car. The vehicle left moments later, driving along Forshaw Street towards Orford Lane.

DC Leah Greenacre said: "CCTV enquiries in the area have identified two potential witnesses who walked along Forshaw Street at the time of the incident.

"There is a woman wearing a bubble jacket, with the hood up, carrying a large umbrella, followed a short time after by a man wearing a waterproof jacket with the hood up and hat underneath the hood and jeans.

"I'd urge those two people to get in touch with us so we can try and piece together the circumstances. We also want to check on the welfare of the two men and ensure they are okay."

The two men from the silver Mercedes are described as of Asian origin and in their early 20s. They were both wearing dark coloured tracksuits with the hoods up.

Enquiries in relation to the incident have been ongoing and so far officers have been unable to identify the vehicle or the people involved.

DC Greenacre added: "Enquiries remain ongoing and I would ask anyone with any information which may aid our investigation to get in touch.

"The same goes for any nearby residents with CCTV footage or drivers passing through at the time who may have dashcam footage."

Anyone with information or footage that may be relevant to the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 870866 or give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/reports or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
