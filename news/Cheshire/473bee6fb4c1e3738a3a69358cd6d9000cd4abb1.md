**Detectives are urging motorists to be vigilant following a spate of thefts in Runcorn.**

Since 4.30am on Monday 5 October nine vehicles have been targeted across the town.

A number of items have been stolen from inside including tools, sunglasses and small personal belongings.

While enquiries to trace those responsible are ongoing, residents are being reminded to ensure their vehicles are locked and secure to reduce the chances of becoming a victim.

Detective Sergeant Rob McLoughlin, from Runcorn Policing Unit, said: "In the last few days we have seen a rise in the number of vehicles targeted by thieves seeking an opportunity to steal items that have been left inside.

"We have been conducting a number of enquiries including CCTV and house-to-house to find those responsible.

"I am appealing for information on anyone who may have been seen acting suspiciously in the area since the early hours of Monday 5 October.

"We believe the vehicles to have been unlocked at the time and therefore I am urging everyone to ensure their cars are safely locked and secure at all times and to also remove valuable items."
