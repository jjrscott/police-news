**Two people from Greater Manchester have been charged with drug dealing offences after quantities of what are believed to be heroin and crack cocaine were seized from a house in Macclesfield.**

Milo Stanley - a 24-year-old man of Old Chapel Street, Edgeley, Stockport - and Tia Ingham - an 18-year-old woman of Eadington Street, Manchester - were arrested in Park Lane, Macclesfield, on the afternoon of Friday 12 February.

The pair have since both been charged with two counts of possession with intent to supply class A drugs (heroin and crack cocaine).

The charges relate to a warrant that was executed at a house in Park Lane, Macclesfield, that afternoon.

Stanley and Ingham both appeared at Warrington Magistrates' Court on Monday 15 February.

Stanley was remanded in custody and Ingham was released on conditional bail.

They are both set to appear at Chester Crown Court on Monday 15 March.

A 39-year-old man from Manchester was also arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs following the raid.

He has been released on conditional bail pending further enquiries.
