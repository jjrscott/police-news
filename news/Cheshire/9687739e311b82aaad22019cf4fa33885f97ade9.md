**A 41-year-old man has been charged with drug dealing offences following a stop and search in Runcorn.**

Peter Wharton was arrested in the Humphreys Close area of Murdishaw shortly before 12 noon on Tuesday 14 July.

This followed a car being stopped and searched by officers.

Wharton, of Lowerson Road, Liverpool, has subsequently been charged with two counts of possession with intent to supply class A drugs (heroin and crack cocaine).

He appeared at Warrington Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 15 July via a video link.

Wharton has been remanded in custody and is set to appear at Chester Crown Court on Wednesday 12 August.
