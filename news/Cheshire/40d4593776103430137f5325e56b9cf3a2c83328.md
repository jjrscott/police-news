Detectives from Northwich have charged three men in connection with a series of high value thefts across the country.

Marius Meiosu, Florin Costea and Gabriel Mocanu were all arrested on Thursday 10 September after officers executed a warrant at an address in Oldham.

Meiosu, 25, Costea, 51, and Mocanu, 36, all of Darwin Street, Oldham, have since been charged with conspiracy to steal from a shop.

All three men have been remanded in custody and are set to appear at Warrington Magistrates' Court, via a video link, today, Friday 11 September.

The charges relate to a series of thefts at supermarkets across the UK, including stores in Cheshire, Lancashire, Manchester, Birmingham, Wales, West Yorkshire, Scotland and Derbyshire.

The total value of the items stolen during the thefts is believed to be in the region of Â£200,000, which occurred between 20 March 2020 and 3 September.
