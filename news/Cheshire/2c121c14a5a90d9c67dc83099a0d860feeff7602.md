Police are appealing for information after eight puppies were stolen from an address in Radway Green near Alsager.

Sometime between 1pm and 3pm on Tuesday 24 November an unknown person forced entry into an address on Butterton Lane.

Once inside they ransacked the property and stole a jewellery box along with six three-day-old Cane Corso puppies and two seven-week-old English Bull Terriers.

A four-year-old French Bulldog is also missing from the address.

Inspector Andrew Smith of Crewe Local Policing Unit, said: "The puppies stolen during this burglary are all too young to be taken from their mums so the owners are desperate for them to be returned as soon as possible, or else they could sadly die. It's also distressing for the puppies themselves who will be missing their parents.

"I'd urge anyone who has any information or is offered a puppy clearly too young to call us. A puppy shouldn't leave their mum until at least eight weeks old. You should also be able to see their mum when purchasing a puppy. Not seeing mum should raise alarm bells."

Anyone with information should contact Cheshire Police on 101 or via www.cheshire.police.uk quoting IML 858804. Alternatively information can be given anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
