**Detectives investigating a burglary in which two cars and two Rolex watches were stolen are appealing for information from members of the public.**

The burglary occurred in Claydon Gardens, Rixton, Warrington, between 10.30pm on Monday 25 November and 4.30am on Tuesday 26 November.

After snapping a patio door lock at the back of the house, the offenders stole the watches and keys to the white Volkswagen Tiguan R Line and the black BMW 335 M Sport parked outside.

They then stole the cars themselves.

The occupiers were asleep inside the house when the incident occurred.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone with information that may help their investigation to come forward.

They have released photographs of the stolen Rolexes and want to hear from anyone who believes they may know where there stolen watches or the stolen cars are.

Detective Constable Ian Morris, of Warrington Local Policing Unit, said: "Burglary is a serious offence in which victims are targeted in their own home, which is the place they should be able to feel most safe.

"Having your home burgled is always a deeply upsetting experience, and in this instance it was particularly unsettling as the incident occurred while the occupiers were asleep inside the house.

"We are determined to establish who carried out the burglary, bring them to justice and have the stolen cars and Rolexes returned to their rightful owners.

"Enquiries are ongoing and we want to speak to anyone who believes they may have seen or have footage of the burglars, either before they broke into the house in Claydon Gardens, Warrington, or as they were fleeing the scene.

"We also want to hear from anyone who thinks they may know who the burglars are or have information regarding the whereabouts of the stolen watches or the stolen cars."

Anyone with information or footage that may be relevant to the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 574012, give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

DC Ian Morris said: "There are steps you can take to reduce the chances of your home being burgled.

"In addition to burglar alarms and making sure that all your doors and windows are closed and locked, you can invest in anti-snap locks and additional locks for the inside of your doors, including patio door security locks.
