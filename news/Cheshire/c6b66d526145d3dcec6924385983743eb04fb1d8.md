13:02 22/03/2021

From 22 March 2021 some firearms previously regarded as antique, and therefore exempt from control, no longer qualify as such and must now be licensed.

Owners of these firearms must act by **23:59 on 21 September 2021** to license them or lawfully dispose of them.

Further information and advice is available on the Government website.
