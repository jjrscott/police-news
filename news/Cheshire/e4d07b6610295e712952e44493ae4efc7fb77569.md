Detectives from Crewe CID are appealing for information and CCTV footage after a car was deliberately set alight in Nantwich.

At around 10.30pm on Saturday 4 April two unknown men began attacking a white Chevrolet Cruze in Whitlow Avenue.

The pair smashed the car's windows before setting fire to the vehicle and running off.

Firefighters were dispatched to the scene and spent more than two hours tackling the fire and making the vehicle safe.

The offenders are both described as being slim and around 5' 10" tall. They were wearing dark clothing and had their hoods up and faces covered.

Enquiries in relation to the incident are ongoing and detectives are urging anyone with information or footage that may aid their investigation to come forward.

Detective Constable Lloyd, of Crewe CID, said: "We are in the early stages of our investigation and want to hear from anyone with information or footage regarding the two offenders.

"Perhaps you live in the area and witnessed the incident or saw the offenders, either before they attacked the car or as they were fleeing the scene.

"I also ask people in the area to check their CCTV cameras to see if they have any footage of the pair travelling to or leaving the scene.

"At the current time there shouldn't be many people out and about so the men should be easy to spot."

Anyone with information or footage that may be relevant to the investigation should call Cheshire Constabulary on 101, quoting IML 675081, or give the details via https://www.cheshire.police.uk/ro/report.

Alternatively, information can be reported to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously.
