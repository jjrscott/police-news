Detectives are investigating the robbery of a child's bike in Birchwood.

At approximately 3.10pm on Monday 3 February the 12-year-old boy was on the footpath between Brock Road and Dewhurst Road.

Two teenage boys approached him, grabbed hold of his bike and told the victim to get off it.

After the victim refused, one of the teenagers punched him to the side of the head and pulled him off the bike.

The offenders then made off with the black and red cube mountain bike towards the bridge over Dewhurst Road.

The boys are believed to be aged around 15 or 16.

One of them is described as being of a chubby build, wearing all black clothing, a scarf and his face was covered.

The other teenager is described as being of a skinny build. He was wearing a black jumper over a black hooded top and black Nike trainers.

Detective Constable John Parry, from Warrington Local Policing Unit, said: "The actions of both teenagers was inexcusable, they left a child terrified in what was an unprovoked assault in order to steal his bike.

"We are following a number of lines enquiry to find the teenagers responsible and I am keen to hear from anyone who may be able to assist with our investigation.

"If you saw the robbery take place, were in the area shortly before and after, or think you know who committed this crime, please get in touch.

"With your help we could find those responsible and possibly reunite the child with his bike."
