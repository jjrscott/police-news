Today, Friday 29th May, marks one week since Alison Danks (also known as Bishop) was reported missing.

Alison, 39, was last sighted on CCTV near to Outwood Academy Bydales School on Coast Road in Marske at 12:22am on Saturday 23rd May and has not been seen since.

Prior to this sighting she had been seen walking along Redcar Road in Marske at 12:10am and then along Marske High Street and towards the school.

Detective Chief Inspector Chris Motson said: "Since Alison was reported missing, officers have worked tirelessly to try and find her, and are still continuing to do so.

"We have carried out a number of searches in the area, analysed hours of CCTV and dash cam footage, conducted door to door enquiries and a number of other extensive enquiries in a bid to trace her.

"Despite this huge effort, we have still not found Alison, and we are still appealing to the public for their help, particularly those who have private CCTV or dash cam footage or to those who may have been walking or driving in the area around the time that she was last sighted.

"All information is significant to us, no matter how irrelevant you may think it is and we would continue to urge people to come forward with footage and information to help us find Alison."

Alison is white, 5'6" tall with fair complexion, green eyes and blonde hair tied up in a ponytail. She was believed to be wearing a distinctive bright mustard coloured jacket, blue jeans and possibly UGG boots at the time she went missing.

Anyone with dashcam or private CCTV footage which could assist the investigation or anyone with any possible sightings of Alison late on Friday 22nd May into the early hours of Saturday 23rd May is asked to contact Cleveland Police on 101.
