Officers from the Operational Support Unit stopped and searched a Land Rover vehicle on Belmont Avenue in Billingham yesterday, Tuesday 19th May.

A large amount of cannabis and cash was reportedly recovered from the vehicle and two men were arrested.

Following the arrests, officers searched a subsequent address and a large quantity of cannabis and cash were recovered again. Some of the cannabis was reportedly disguised in sweet packets (as shown in the released image).

Officers seized the Land Rover vehicle and a man aged 20 was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class B drugs and driving under the influence of drugs. A second man aged 26 was arrested on suspicion with possession with intent to supply class B drugs. Both males were released under investigation pending further enquiries.
