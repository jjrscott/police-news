In September, Middlesbrough had three 2-in-1 burglaries, were a property is broken into and their vehicle also stolen.

Officers are advising vehicle owners to secure them in a garage if possible or keeping car keys out of sight and in hard to reach places. As well as making sure all doors and windows are locked both in your home and your vehicle.
