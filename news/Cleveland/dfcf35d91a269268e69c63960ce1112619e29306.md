Officers from the Operational Support Unit and the Hub Intelligence Team discovered a large cannabis farm at a property on Stockton High Street this morning, Monday 6th July.

1200 cannabis plants were recovered from four floors and 12 rooms of the premises which has an estimated street value of Â£960,000.

Two people aged 19 and 50 have been arrested on suspicion of drugs offences and currently remain in custody.

A Cleveland Police Spokesperson said: "Today we have confiscated nearly a million pounds worth of drugs from our streets.

"Drugs are a blight on our society and cause misery in our communities. This cannabis farm was clearly organised and highly sophisticated. Criminal activity such as this is nothing but detrimental to people's lives.

"We hope today's result has a positive impact on our communities and shows people that as a Force we will do everything we can to rid drugs from our area."

The premises is currently cordoned off by officers from the Stockton Neighbourhood Team whilst enquiries continue.
