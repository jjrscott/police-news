Detectives are appealing for information to identify a man in a CCTV image after a knifepoint robbery in a store in Middlesbrough.

The incident happened on Christmas Eve, Thursday 24th December, at around 7:15am at the One Stop Shop on Eastbourne Road when a male suspect attended the shop armed with a knife and attempted to take cash.

The suspect then left the store and attempted to take car keys from a member of public. This was unsuccessful and the male then ran off in the direction of The Vale.

Officers would like to identify the man in the CCTV image as he may be able to assist them with their enquiries.

The male in the image is wearing a very distinctive jacket, he is described as a white male, possible aged over 30, around 5ft 4"-6" tall, small build and wearing a cream and beige Hunter style jacket, with a blue jacket underneath, black trousers and black trainers. He was also wearing black cotton gloves and a skull face mask and spoke with a local accent.

Anyone with information or anyone who may have CCTV or dash cam footage are asked to contact Cleveland Police on the non-emergency number 101, quoting incident number 208071.
