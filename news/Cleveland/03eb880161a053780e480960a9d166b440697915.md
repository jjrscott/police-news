Officers are warning members of the public to be vigilant following reports of men knocking on people's doors and claiming that their homes need their roof/ guttering fixing.

Two properties have been targeted on Hummerhill Lane in Marske with one resident handing over a small amount of cash and another resident handing over Â£1,000. Both victims are aged in their 70's.

Officers received the reports on Tuesday 16th June and it is believed three males are responsible for the incidents. One of the men is described as being a white male, of large build with short, frizzy hair and aged in his late 20s to early 30s.

It is believed the men are travelling in a van - possibly with the registration beginning in NA08.

Police are warning the public to be vigilant in a bid to prevent people from becoming victim to fraudulent scams.

Anyone with information regarding the men is asked to contact Cleveland Police on 101 quoting 096676.
