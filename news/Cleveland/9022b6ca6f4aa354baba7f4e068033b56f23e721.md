John Pullin aged 33 of no fixed abode has been given a custodial sentence at Teesside Crown Court for two counts of assaulting an emergency worker and a number of other offences.

Two officers from Stockton Response were kicked and spat at by the man whilst dealing with an incident involving the suspect on Church Road in Stockton just after midnight on Saturday 18th July.

Stockton Neighbourhood Inspector Jon Willoughby said: "Officers put themselves at risk every day on duty and should not be subjected to abuse or be attacked whilst at work.

"Spitting and kicking officers is disgusting behaviour and I hope the sentence sets an example to others that we will not tolerate our officers being assaulted under any circumstances and we will bring you to justice if you behave in this way."

John Pullin has been sentenced to 11 months.
