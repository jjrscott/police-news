Since the beginning of COVID-19 the UK has seen an increase in scams linked to the virus which has cost people millions of pounds.

In Cleveland, the Cyber Crime Team receives around 170 reports of fraud each month which range from romance, investment and online shopping fraud.

Computers being hacked and Ransomware attacks are also common reports made to the Force and with many people working from home it means more people are vulnerable to becoming victim to these crimes.

Officers from the Cyber Crime team would like to remind people to use strong, individual passwords on all social, personal and work accounts on their devices to make it harder for criminals to gain access to them.

The National Cyber Security Centre has published guidance on what makes a good password as well as how to safely access and manage your passwords across multiple devices using password managers.
