On behalf of the North East Regional Specialist Operations Unit (NERSOU), officers are warning people to be vigilant after reports were received of someone fraudulently claiming to be from Cleveland Police.

Phishing emails or phone calls have been targeting businesses in the North East area claiming to be from an officer from Cleveland Police, in an attempt to fraudulently obtain services.

The Force has been made aware of three incidents of this nature over the last month and are warning members of the public to be vigilant to prevent people from being scammed.

Cleveland Police email addresses end in 'Cleveland.pnn.police.uk' or 'Cleveland.police.uk' and any email from an officer within the Force would end the same way.

If you have been contacted from someone claiming to be from the Force and if you are unsure, please take their name and call 101 and ask to speak to that person via an operator.
