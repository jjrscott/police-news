Cleveland Police received a report of criminal damage to a police vehicle yesterday at 4:30pm. The vehicle was parked outside of a property on Micklow Close in Redcar when it was vandalised and damaged.

Assistant Chief Constable Lisa Orchard said: "This was a targeted attack and it is a selfish act from individuals who have gone out of their way to ensure that the Force now has one less emergency services vehicle on the road, which now cannot be used to protect our communities.

"This particular police vehicle belonged to the Redcar and Cleveland Response team and officers from this team provide a frontline response to emergency incidents in the area.

"Spray painting graffiti and ripping the radio antenna from the vehicle will be costly to fix. We simply do not need this when our officers are already working tremendously hard, in the midst of a pandemic, and are reliant on these vehicles to provide the best possible service to the public.

"Our officers are carrying out a number of enquiries in a bid to trace the people responsible for this damage and we will bring them to justice.

"I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to the local residents in the area around Micklow Close and ask them to come forward with any information regarding the people who committed this crime. There will be people who are well aware of who damaged the police vehicle and I would urge them to do the right thing and come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Cleveland Police on 101 quoting 024958. Anonymous reports can also be given to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
