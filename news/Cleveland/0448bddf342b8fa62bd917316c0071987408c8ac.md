Police have reported a man for summons after they found class C drugs in a property in Middlesbrough when they executed a drugs warrant.

Middlesbrough Neighbourhood Team, assisted by the Operational Support Unit, responded to complaints from the community about drug dealing and associated antisocial behaviour at an address on Peaton Street in North Ormesby.

Officers located a small quantity of prescription medication, believed to be tamazepam, inside the address this morning (Wednesday 20th January).

A 47-year-old man was interviewed in connection with possession of class C drugs and reported for summons.

Neighbourhood Sergeant John Sproson said: "The behaviour at the property has been having a negative impact on local residents. We will continue to work to resolve the issues, working alongside our partners and we would continue to encourage anyone suffering issues like this in their local neighbourhood to get in touch with us."

Anyone with information regarding drugs activity in their local area can contact Cleveland Police on 101, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or online at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
