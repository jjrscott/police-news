Detectives investigating the murder of missing Thornaby woman, Naheed Khan, received new information in mid-November 2019 which they say could be crucial to the investigation.

For operational reasons, officers can't explain how they received the information, or specific details, but they say the intelligence could be of real significance to the investigation.

They are now directly appealing to those who have provided a crucial piece of information last month to come forward again as they may be able to assist officers with their enquiries.

Senior Investigating Officer, T/ Detective Chief Inspector Mark Dimelow, said: "I would urge the person or people who have provided us with crucial intelligence to make contact and help us with our enquiries. This could be the key to helping us find Naheed and bringing her back to her family.

"We have had support from people across Cleveland sharing our appeals, and whilst I know it can be frustrating that we can't explain in greater detail about what we know, it is to protect the integrity of what is an extremely sensitive enquiry."

Naheed, 43, had links to Stockton, Middlesbrough and Thornaby. She is described as Asian, of slim build and around 5ft 6" tall, with long, dark hair.

Anyone with information is asked to call Cleveland Police on the non-emergency number 101. Alternatively, people can visit https://mipp.police.uk/ and provide information direct to the investigation team.

Independent charity Crimestoppers is now offering a reward of up to Â£10,000 for information that leads to identifying the location of Naheed Khan's body. Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111 or online at: www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
