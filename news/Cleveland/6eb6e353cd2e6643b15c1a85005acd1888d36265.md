Officers investigating the suspected murder of Natalie Jenkins, 32, have uncovered a new last sighting of her on Linthorpe Road in Middlesbrough at 8:13pm on Tuesday 10th December 2019.

CCTV footage which is being released today shows Natalie walking along the street (at the junction with Park Road South) from Parliament Road and is the latest sighting detectives have of her.

In addition to this, a specialist team of officers will be conducting a search at her home address on Westbury Street in Thornaby today.

Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Chief Inspector Mark Dimelow said: "The new sighting of Natalie is an encouraging development for the investigation as we are slowly piecing together her last movements in the hope that this will lead us to her whereabouts.

"Linthorpe Road is a very busy street and we would appeal to anyone who sighted Natalie, wearing a burgundy coat and a light coloured hat at this time and location to contact us as a matter of urgency.

"The investigative team are dedicated to tracing Natalie and have spent countless hours trawling through footage, which has provided us with this latest sighting.

"Specialist officers will also spend today searching Natalie's home address which will hopefully provide us with some further information to help us locate her."

Natalie is a white female, of very slim build, around 5'5" tall with a fair complexion and straight brown hair. She has hazel eyes and a missing front tooth. Natalie has a tattoo saying SWANNY on her neck and another on her wrist saying SWANN.

Anyone with information as to Natalie's whereabouts or anyone who may have seen her, is asked to contact Cleveland Police on 101.

Independent charity Crimestoppers is now offering a reward of up to Â£10,000 for information they receive that leads to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the suspected murder of Natalie Jenkins: https://bit.ly/39NQbNN
