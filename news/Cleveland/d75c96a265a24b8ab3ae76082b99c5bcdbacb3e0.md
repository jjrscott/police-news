Officers are releasing CCTV footage of missing Alison Danks (also known as Bishop) which shows her walking in Marske on Saturday 23rd May at around 12:10am.

The footage shows Alison, 39, walking along Redcar Road in Marske, along Marske High Street and towards Outwood Academy Bydales School on Coast Road.

CCTV spots Alison walking on Redcar Road at 12:10am and further footage shows her in the area of the school at 12:22am on Saturday. Police have released a section of this footage.

Detective Chief Inspector Chris Motson said: "We have a dedicated team of officers working to trace Alison's whereabouts and we are appealing to anyone who may have been out walking or driving in this area around the time that Alison was last seen and who may have seen Alison to come forward as a matter of urgency.

"Alison was wearing a distinctive bright mustard coloured jacket which is shown in the below video, blue jeans and possibly UGG boots.

"She is well known in the local area as she runs Pet Care Solutions, a dog walking and pet sitting service. She also has links to other parts of the country but at the moment officers are focusing on Marske and the surrounding areas."

Alison is white 5'6" tall with fair complexion, green eyes and blonde hair tied up in a ponytail.

Anyone with dashcam or private CCTV footage which could assist the investigation or anyone with any possible sightings of Alison late on Friday 22nd May into the early hours of Saturday 23rd May is asked to contact Cleveland Police on 101.
