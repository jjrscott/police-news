Officers have arrested two further men this morning in connection with the Naheed Khan murder investigation.

Naheed, 43, has been missing since early May 2018. It is believed her last known movements were when she withdrew money from a cash machine at the junction of Marton Road and Southfield Road in Middlesbrough at 5:04pm on Sunday 6th May 2018 (early bank holiday).

Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Chief Inspector, Mark Dimelow said: "This investigation is incredibly complex and we have conducted thousands of enquiries and huge pieces of work to get the inquiry to this stage. The arrests made today are as a result of information coming into the investigation team, but for operational reasons I can't give any further details on the nature of the information.

"It's absolutely key that people still continue to speak to us about what they know, or if they are keeping secrets for others, or have any information at all, even if they think might be insignificant - I would urge people to speak to us and end the suffering of Naheed's loving family."

Three men have been arrested in total in connection with the investigation. One man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and for conspiring to prevent a lawful and decent burial.

A second man has been arrested on suspicion of committing an act/ series of acts with intent to pervert the course of justice and for conspiring to prevent a lawful and decent burial.

A man arrested on suspicion of murder in February 2019 remains released under investigation.

Cleveland Police is still appealing for anyone with information regarding the disappearance of Naheed to come forward.

Naheed had links to Stockton, Middlesbrough and Thornaby. She is described as Asian, of slim build and around 5ft 6" tall, with long, dark hair.

Anyone with information is asked to call Cleveland Police on the non-emergency number 101.

Independent charity Crimestoppers is offering a reward of up to Â£10,000 for information that leads to identifying the location of Naheed Khan's body. Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111 or online at: www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
