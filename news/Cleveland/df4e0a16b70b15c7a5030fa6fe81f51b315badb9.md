**Police have recovered 60 cannabis plants from a property in Middlesbrough, estimated to be worth up to Â£50,000. **

Response officers attended an address on Allinson Street in North Ormesby yesterday evening, Thursday 28th January, and located the cannabis farm across three rooms.

No one has been arrested at this time, however, enquiries are ongoing.

Neighbourhood Sergeant John Sproson said: "Residents in North Ormesby have reported concerns regarding drugs activity in the local area and we are tackling the issue head on, resulting in a number of cannabis farms being discovered in the area recently.

"We will continue to tackle the issue, as it causes misery for the local community, and we will continue to deny an income to organised crime groups who take advantage of local properties to carry out their illegal activities.

"Anyone who may have information regarding drugs activity in their local area is urged to call Cleveland Police on 101."

People can also report concerns to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or online at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
