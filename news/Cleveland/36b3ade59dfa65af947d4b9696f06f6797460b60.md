Wayne Newton, 41, was last seen at around 1pm on Saturday October 24. These two CCTV images show him at the One Stop Shop, The Viewley Centre, Hemlington.

He was wearing: grey jeans, white trainers and a dark hooded top with the word 'Polo', written in white on the back. Wayne is described as a white, medium build and around 6 foot tall. He has short, brown hair and blue eyes.

Officers have been out in the area Wayne was last seen in putting up posters and carrying out searches, including around Hemlington Lake.

Today they're also appealing to people, especially those in the rural areas close to Hemlington, to check their own garages, outbuildings or sheds as the search for Wayne continues.

Detective Chief Inspector Chris Motson, said: "Wayne has now been missing for more than two weeks and we're extremely concerned for his welfare.

"It is possible he has sought shelter somewhere in the Hemlington area and we'd ask people to assist our search teams by checking in their sheds, garages or outbuildings.
