The family of Natalie Jenkins, 32, have today released a new photo of her as a teenager, six weeks on from when she went missing.

Natalie is 16 years old in the image and the photo is the most recent one released by her family.

She was last seen on Westbury Street in Thornaby on Wednesday 11th December 2019 at 10am. Her movements since this time are unknown and she has not been in touch with her family or friends which is a huge concern for officers as it is out of character for Natalie not to be in touch.

Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Chief Inspector, Mark Dimelow said: "We along with Natalie's family are extremely concerned for her welfare. It is not common for her to be out of touch with her family and friends for this length of time.

"A dedicated team of officers have been carrying out a substantial amount of enquiries in a bid to try and find her but to date have still have not managed to locate her.

"We are still urging the public to come forward if they have any information which could help us find her. All information is relevant to us, no matter how insignificant you think it is."

Natalie has links in Thornaby and Middlesbrough. She is a white female, of very slim build, around 5'5" tall with a fair complexion and straight brown hair. She has hazel eyes and a missing front tooth. Natalie has a tattoo saying SWANN on her neck and another on her wrist saying SWANNY.

Anyone with information as to Natalie's whereabouts or anyone who may have seen her, is asked to contact Cleveland Police on 101.

Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111 or online at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
