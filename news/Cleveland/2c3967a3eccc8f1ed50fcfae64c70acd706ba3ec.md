A senior Cleveland Police officer has welcomed a 40 month sentence given today to a Billingham man who assaulted a police officer who was dealing with him in Middlesbrough Police Office.

Andrew Graham, 36, had been arrested for harassment of his former partner and he punched the Police Constable to the head and face several times, causing a cut above his eye and facial bruising. The officer received treatment at hospital.

Graham was sentenced today, Tuesday, at Teesside Crown Court.

Assistant Chief Constable Steve Graham said: "I welcome the sentence handed down today; it demonstrates that both police and the courts take an extremely dim view of anyone who assaults and injures a police officer whilst doing their job.

"It should also serve as a stern warning that such behaviour will not be tolerated by emergency workers and we will work tirelessly with the Crown Prosecution Service to bring such offenders before the courts."
