Between 6pm on New Year's Eve and 6am on New Year's Day, officers arrested 80 people from across the Force area on one of the busiest nights of the year.

Over 20 people were arrested on suspicion of theft from a shop, 12 for assault by beating, 5 for drink driving, 5 for grievous bodily harm and 4 for being drunk and disorderly in a public place. Other people were arrested for assaulting an emergency worker, criminal damage, common assault, possessing drugs and for threatening behaviour.

The first arrest of 2020 was made in Eaglescliffe at one minute past midnight, when officers from response, the dog unit and T/Chief Superintendents Alison Jackson and Dave Sutherland arrested a man on suspicion of burglary with the help of Police Dog Jeff.

T/Chief Superintendent Alison Jackson, who was out on patrol on New Year's Eve with officers said: "Officers and staff across the Force worked tirelessly on New Year's Eve to keep everyone safe.

"This night was one of the busiest of the year and I am so proud of everyone for their hard work, dedication and determination to keep our communities safe.

"All of our officers and staff work around the clock every day of the year, which includes the festive period. They sacrifice their time with their family and friends, on occasions putting their lives on the line to keep the public we serve safe. The Force and I are grateful for their amazing work.

"I would like to wish the public and our officers and staff a happy and safe New Year."
