Cleveland Police has been educating the Mini Police recruits on the safe use of online technology as part of Safer Internet Day today (Tuesday 11th February).

Over 80 Mini Police recruits from nine schools across Cleveland were invited to the Community Safety Hub in Hemlington this morning to be given first-hand information on how to stay safe when using the internet on phones, tablets and computers.

School Liaison Officers spoke with the children, aged between 9 and 10 years old, and asked them what they used the internet for, the types of usernames and profiles they have and educated them on not sharing too much information.

In addition to this, the children were informed about the digital footprint when using the internet and how posting certain things online can potentially affect their careers in the future.

Chief Inspector Scott Cowie, who attended the event this morning, said: "Safer Internet Day is a great opportunity to provide children and parents with advice on how to stay safe online.

"The internet can be a great tool, but can also pose as a threat and leave children vulnerable to exploitation and grooming.

"It is important that everyone is educated on the dangers of the internet and how to keep safe online. Hopefully today we have provided some knowledge to our new recruits who can pass this information to their friends and family."

Police and Crime Commissioner Barry Coppinger added: "I've funded School Liaison Officers for several years now and their work in schools and how they educate children about topics such as internet safety is really valuable.

"It is vital that children are careful when using the internet and I am pleased the Force is playing its part in this important national initiative."

More information on Safer Internet Day can be found on their website, which includes top tips for staying safe online for different age groups: https://www.saferinternet.org.uk/safer-internet-day/safer-internet-day-2020/safer-internet-day-2020-top-tips
