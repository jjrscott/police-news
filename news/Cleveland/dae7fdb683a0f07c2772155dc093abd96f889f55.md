Cleveland Police are warning parents to be vigilant when allowing their children to use mobile phones and tablets unattended during the lockdown period.

Children are likely to be reliant on the internet to keep in touch with friends on different apps, however, offenders will be exploiting this opportunity to target children.

We know parents are concerned about some disturbing video content online, for example, on You Tube and You Tube for Kids.

Watch our short clip from Detective Constable Stuart Younger-Cooper from our Cyber Crime Team on how to keep your child safe. You can also visit www.nspcc.org.uk or www.nationalonlinesafety.com
