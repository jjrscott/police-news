Cleveland Police are today naming and releasing a photo of Jacob McStravick, 17, of Hundens Lane in Darlington, who was sentenced to 11 years and 8 months in prison yesterday following an incident on Linthorpe Road in Middlesbrough.

Teesside Crown Court lifted a reporting restriction on naming the youth after Jacob pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm with intent following a knife attack in December last year.

A man aged in his mid-20s suffered lifelong injuries after he was attacked by McStravick, who used a stanley knife in the unprovoked attack. The victim now has scarring across his face and neck.

Investigating Officer, Detective Constable Brian Lightowler, said: "We welcome the sentence handed to Jacob. This was a nasty attack and a terrible ordeal for the victim to have gone through.

"The victim, who was simply enjoying a night out at the time of the incident, has now been left with lifelong injuries as a result of a mindless act of violence which must have been absolutely terrifying.

"As a Force, we will not tolerate knife crime under any circumstances and we will ensure we do everything we can to bring to justice those responsible.

"I hope the sentence passed to McStravick provides some form of closure to the victim, knowing that justice has been served and he will be behind bars for a very long time."
