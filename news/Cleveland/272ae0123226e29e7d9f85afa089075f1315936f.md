Police are appealing for information following a fatal road traffic collision on Bankfields Road in Eston (close to the junction of Woodcock Close) yesterday, Tuesday 21st July at 7:35pm.

The collision involved a white Volkswagen Golf and a cyclist.

Sadly the cyclist, 14 year old Jake Hurst died in James Cook University hospital shortly after the collision.

His family are today releasing his name and photo but would ask for privacy at this extremely difficult time. Our thoughts remain with Jake's family and friends.

Officers are asking for anyone who witnessed the collision or who may have captured it on dash cam footage to contact Cleveland Police on 101 quoting 117986.
