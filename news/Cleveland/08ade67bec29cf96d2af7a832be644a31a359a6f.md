The aim of this video is to raise awareness around child abuse and how we can continue to safeguard and protect children as we continue through the COVID-19 lockdown.

Not every child is safe in their home and during the lockdown period tensions can be high, meaning many children will be vulnerable and at risk. Our job is to do everything we can to keep all children safe.

Please watch our video, where Safeguarding Detective Chief Inspector Deb Fenny will talk about the different elements of child abuse and who to contact.
