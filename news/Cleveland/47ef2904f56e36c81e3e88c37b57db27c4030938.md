Following an investigation by Stockton CID officers, Ricky Hough aged 34, of no fixed abode has been sentenced to six years in prison at Teesside Crown Court.

Hough was charged with drugs offences, acquiring/ using criminal property and possessing a weapon for the discharge of a noxious liquid / gas / electrical incapacitation device after being arrested at a property on Brusselton Court in Stockton on Friday 15th May.

A large quantity of drugs, cash, a machete and a taser were seized from the property.

Detective Inspector Louise Sproson from Stockton CID said: "We hope Hough's sentence sets a clear example to others that those found guilty of drugs offences and possessing offensive weapons will be sent to prison for their crimes for some time.

"Drugs cause nothing but grief and misery in our communities and the weapons seized from this property could have caused serious harm or killed someone.

"The sentence handed to Hough has taken one more criminal off our streets. I would like to thank my team for their hard work in ensuring he was brought to justice."

A woman aged 31 was arrested at the time of the incident but has been found not guilty of committing any of the offences.
