Nearly £1million pounds worth of drugs, two vehicles and £10,000 cash was seized by the Force from six addresses in Cleveland and one in Durham last week.

Cannabis was recovered from properties in Thornaby, Middlesbrough, Hartlepool, Billingham and Durham, resulting in seven people being charged.

Superintendent Tariq Ali said: "Our dedicated Drugs Enforcement Team work tirelessly every day in a bid to tackle the supply of drugs in Cleveland and last week their hard work paid off after they seized a huge amount of cannabis.

"Week in and week out they continue to crackdown of drugs supply in Cleveland in order to remove potentially harmful drugs from our streets and bring those allegedly responsible to justice.

"Criminality and the associated antisocial behaviour around drugs offences causes nothing but misery amongst our communities and we will strive to reduce the supply of drugs in our area to improve the lives of those living in our communities."

Seven men aged between 24 and 36 were arrested and charged in connection with drugs offences and they have all appeared at Teesside Magistrates Court.

Officers carried out drugs warrants at properties on: Milton Road - Hartlepool, Langley Avenue - Thornaby, Cuthbert Avenue - Middlesbrough, Deacon Street - Middlesbrough, Kindersley Street - Middlesbrough and Bedale Avenue - Billingham. A warrant was also carried out at a property on Stavordale Street in Seaham, Durham.
