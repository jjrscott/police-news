Police are reminding members of the public to continue to adhere to government guidelines throughout the COVID-19 lockdown.

Officers are aware the weather is meant to be nice this weekend and some shops have re-opened for business however people should only travel when it is essential to do so.

Chief Superintendent Thom McLoughlin, Head of Local Policing, said: "The Force has not relaxed the government lockdown rules and we will be continuing to patrol our four districts over the weekend and beyond to ensure people are complying with the rules.

"We understand it is difficult to stay indoors when the weather is nice but by staying home you are protecting loved ones and keyworkers who are risking their lives to save others.

"Please do not make unnecessary journeys until the restrictions have been lifted and stay home unless there is a reasonable excuse to leave.

"If we all work together we can save lives by protecting the vulnerable people living in our area and the NHS. Thank you to everyone who has abided by the rules so far and have a safe weekend."

The government guidelines for travelling includes:

 * shopping for basic necessities, for example food and medicine, which must be as infrequent as possible
 * going out for one form of exercise a day, for example a run, walk, or cycle - alone or with members of your household
 * any medical need, or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person
 * travelling only where essential - which includes to and from work, if you're unable to work from home
