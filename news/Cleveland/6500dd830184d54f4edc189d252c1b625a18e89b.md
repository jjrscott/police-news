We are seeing more people out on bicycles, likely because some of the lockdown restrictions have been eased.

However, bicycle theft continues to increase and demand for bicycles remains high. Please consider the following tips, and remember as a general rule - if you're not sat on it, secure it!

**Follow these tips to help prevent you becoming a victim of bike crime.**

 * Get a good bike lock, better still two. Ensure that the locks you buy meet the 'Sold Secure' Gold standard. You'll find these quality locks at your local bike shops and online at all the regular bike retailers' websites, but read of the various reviews from other users. Click soldsecure.com for more information on good quality locks.

 * Lock up removable parts (e.g. wheels, saddle) and take light fittings/cycle computers with you.

 * Have your bike's frame security-marked or engraved. Once the pandemic is over, we will again be offering bike marking events across the Force area using our Dot Peen marking equipment. It marks the frame with your postcode and house number. Keep an eye on your local neighbourhood policing page on Facebook for these events in the future.

 * Take a photograph of your bike and record its description, including any unique marks or features. Register the frame number (normally found underneath the bike, between the pedals or where the back wheel slots in) on https://www.bikeregister.com

 * When you leave your bike, leave it where the thief can be seen. In your garden or in the shed, it should be locked to something substantial, or in the case of the shed, a ladder or steps, the lawnmower etc. If there is nothing to lock it to, make sure you put your locks through the frame and a wheel to disable it. Make the locks and bike hard to manoeuvre. Consider a ground anchor, which secures to the floor or fabric of the building, which you can secure your bike to.

**And finally!**

Don't be tempted to buy a stolen second-hand bike. Insist on proof of ownership and check the bike frame number on the Bike Checker at www.bikeregister.com

If your bike has been stolen, contact the police on the non-emergency number 101, or online at www.cleveland.police.uk. Give them your frame number, BikeRegister number, photo and any other details and register your bike as stolen on BikeRegister.

Lock it or risk losing it!

If you have any information about a crime, contact Cleveland Police on 101. Always call 999 in an ongoing emergency. You can also contact independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
