"As a family, we would urge anyone with any information regarding his death, anything at all, even if you think it's not important, to please contact police as you could provide vital information to help the investigation.

"We would also like to send our heartfelt gratitude to the teams that tried to save John's life. Knowing they tried everything they could to save him is comforting to our family!

"We would also like to thank the police who from the start have been nothing short of amazing.

"We love you John and miss you dearly. Your heartbroken family."
