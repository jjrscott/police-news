Since late November last year, Cleveland Police have received thirteen reports of burglaries at properties where jewellery has been targeted.

In the wake of these incidents, crime prevention officers are again repeating their advice to members of the public to remain vigilant.

Three of the incidents took place in Stockton, eight in Middlesbrough and two in the Redcar and Cleveland area.

No arrests have been made at this time, however, enquiries are ongoing to identify those responsible.

Officers made an earlier appeal after three incidents in three days on Spenborough Road in Elm Tree in Stockton on Tuesday 26th November, Virginia Gardens in Middlesbrough on Wednesday 27th November and Chalford Oaks in Middlesbrough on Thursday 28th November.

Thousands of pounds worth of family jewellery was stolen in the burglaries, and Cleveland Police crime prevention team are advising people on how to keep their jewellery safe, by issuing advice including:

 * Ensure that doors and windows are locked in your property, whether you are in or out of the house.
 * When not wearing your jewellery, keep it somewhere safe and out of sight.
 * Invest in a lockable, concealed and immovable safe for your home and use it.
 * Consider placing your valuables in a safety deposit centre. It is recommended that you use a centre registered with the Financial Conduct Authority.
 * Invest in a burglar alarm and remember to turn it on.
 * Insure your jewellery.
 * Take photographs of your jewellery and keep these separate, along with any documentation.
 * Security mark your jewellery with a DNA property marking kit.

Anyone who may have information regarding the incidents is asked to contact Cleveland Police on the non-emergency number 101.
