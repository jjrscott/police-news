We're asking families to put a spell on their traditional Halloween festivities this year to help save lives.

The four districts in Teesside all fall under the tier 2 COVID regulations and officers are advising families to think about different ways to celebrate Halloween and enjoy alternatives to traditional trick or treating on 31 October.

Superintendent Sharon Cooney said: "We understand it's frustrating for parents and their children with the COVID restrictions in place but it would be witchful thinking to think Halloween celebrations will continue as normal this year.

"Huge efforts are being made by people to adjust to the restrictions in place, and we know children will want to get dressed-up and mark Halloween, but we need to celebrate differently this year to keep people safe. Some local communities are putting pumpkins in windows so when children see the pumpkin, the adult with them gives them a sweet and they don't visit homes.

"The rules that keep us safe are so important on Halloween. Remember hands, face, space. Don't go knocking on doors, or collect sweets from communal bowls. Don't socialise with anyone indoors who area outside your household or support bubble. Stick to the rule of six outdoors, and make sure you socially distance. Wash your hands regularly and take hand sanitiser with you if you go out. We want people to have a fangtastic but safe Halloween."

Please check the Government website in regards to the COVID regulations.
