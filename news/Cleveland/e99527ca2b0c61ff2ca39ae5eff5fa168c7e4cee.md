Two years ago today, 6th May, Naheed Khan, 43 disappeared and officers launched a murder investigation to try and find answers for her family.

Money was withdrawn from Naheed's bank account at an ATM machine at the junction of Marton Road and Southfield Road in Middlesbrough at 5:04pm on Sunday 6th May 2018 (a bank holiday weekend).

Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Chief Inspector Mark Dimelow said: "We established that Naheed went missing around the 5th-7th May 2018 and since her disappearance, officers have worked tirelessly on this investigation

"Two years on, we have carried out thousands of enquiries and arrested five people in connection with the investigation but Naheed's body has never been discovered.

"We strongly believe people are still withholding vital information from us and we would urge anyone with information to please come forward, for the sake of Naheed's family, who have suffered tremendously throughout this ordeal.

"Naheed's last known movements were over early May bank holiday in 2018 in central Middlesbrough, around the university, Linthorpe Road and Newport.

"All of these areas are extremely busy places and we believe the answers to her death lie within the Middlesbrough area.

"If you are reading this and know what has happened to Naheed, or know who is responsible, please show some compassion and humility and come forward and help us. This can be done anonymously via independent charity Crimestoppers."

Naheed's sister on behalf of the family added: "There isn't a day that goes by where we don't think about where Naheed is or what has happened to her, the time that has passed hasn't made this any easier.

"Naheed is not forgotten and every occasion and milestone that passes she is missed dearly. We just want her body to be buried respectfully like she deserves.

"We are begging with all of our hearts for someone to come forward anonymously and give us some closure so we can try and live with some peace of mind that we know where she is."

Naheed had links to Stockton, Middlesbrough and Thornaby. She is described as Asian, of slim build and around 5ft 6" tall, with long, dark hair.

Anyone with information is asked to call Cleveland Police on the non-emergency number 101.

Alternatively, people can visit https://mipp.police.uk/ and provide information direct to the investigation team.

Independent charity Crimestoppers is offering a reward of up to Â£10,000 for information that leads to identifying the location of Naheed Khan's body.
