Officers from the Stockton Neighbourhood team conducted a drugs warrant at a property on Yarm Lane in Stockton on Saturday 27th June.

A large cannabis farm was discovered at the premises and 469 cannabis plants were seized with a potential street value of between £130,000 and £390,000.

"Drugs cause nothing but misery on our streets and the drugs warrant executed on Yarm Lane was a big success and will prevent further crime in our area."
