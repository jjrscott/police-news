Police are appealing for information following a fatal road traffic collision on the A67 westbound, beneath the rail bridge east of Urlay Nook Road.

The single-vehicle collision occurred at around 1:25pm on Saturday 15th February, involving a blue Vauxhall Astra.

The driver, a man in his 40s, suffered serious injuries and sadly died a number of days later. Our thoughts are with the victim's family at this difficult time.

Officers are asking for anyone who witnessed the collision, may have captured vehicle on dash cam footage or may have witnessed the vehicle prior to the collision to contact PC Andrew Lawson via the non-emergency number 101, quoting the reference number 025570.
