Police have launched a murder investigation after a 22-year-old man sadly died in hospital following an incident in Stockton.

Officers were called to Stockton High Street at around 3:20am this morning, Friday 27th December, where paramedics had been called to give medical assistance to a man who had collapsed in the street. The man was taken to the University Hospital of North Tees, where he was sadly pronounced dead.

Police believe that the man had been inside Goldie's Bar where an incident had taken place and he left the premises prior to becoming ill outside.

Two men, aged 27 and 30, have been arrested on suspicion of murder and they remain in police custody at this time.

A post mortem examination will take place later today.

The man has not yet been formally identified, however, specially trained officers are supporting the man's family and our thoughts remain with them at this difficult time.

Anyone who may have been in Goldie's Bar and who may have witnessed the incident or may have information regarding it is asked to contact Cleveland Police on 101 or independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or online at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
