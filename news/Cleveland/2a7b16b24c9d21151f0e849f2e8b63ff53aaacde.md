The family of missing Natalie Jenkins, 32, are appealing for her to return home safely.

Natalie lives in Thornaby and has connections in Middlesbrough and has been missing since Tuesday 10th December.

Officers and her family are extremely concerned for her welfare. Natalie's family said today: "Natalie I don't know what went so wrong to make you leave your home and all your things. All is not lost Natalie. You have been offered a ground floor flat which you have always wanted.

**"** You are doing so well, and all of this can be sorted out. Just ring us and we can start again.

"Natalie, you are not alone, you are loved. Whatever has gone wrong, we can put it right. All you need to do is ring your mam and dad."

Detective Chief Inspector Matt Murphy-King said: "We have a dedicated team of officers looking into Natalie's disappearance and we are extremely concerned for her wellbeing.

"It is very out of character for Natalie to go missing as her family would usually be in contact with her on a regular basis, especially with Christmas being around the corner.

"I would urge anyone who may have seen her to please contact us as your information could assist us with our investigation and help us find her."

Natalie is described as being a white female, of fair complexion with thin straight brown hair and hazel eyes and she is of slim build. She has a missing front tooth and a tattoo on her neck which says SWANN, and one on her wrist which says SWANNY.

Police would urge anyone with information or anyone who has seen her to call 101 immediately quoting event number 212713. Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111 or online at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
