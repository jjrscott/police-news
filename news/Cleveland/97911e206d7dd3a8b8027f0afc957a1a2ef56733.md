Dozens of officers from teams throughout Cleveland Police* joined forces today (Friday 11th October) in a bid to locate and arrest a number of wanted people.

After an early morning briefing at the Community Safety Hub, the teams headed out across the force area and by 11.30am 16 people had already been arrested, a vehicle had been seized and a suspected cannabis farm discovered.

With a number of people wanted on warrant for overdue bail, for recall to prison or after being circulated as potential suspects in on-going inquiries, notable arrests today included:

A 47 year old man from Stockton arrested on suspicion of human trafficking

A 38 year old Hartlepool man arrested for prison recall (his original sentence was for an assault)

A 44 year old Stockon woman was arrested on suspicion of a Â£12, 000 fraud

A 25 year old man from Hartlepool was arrested on suspicion of assault

A 21 year old Hartlepool man was arrested on suspicion of violent offences

A 16 year old boy from Middlesbrough was arrested for breach of bail following an alleged robbery

Two men, aged 52 and 54, were arrested at the scene of a suspected cannabis farm in Hartlepool

Day of Action co-ordinator, Temporary Detective Chief Inspector Daryll Tomlinson, said he was pleased with how today's operation had gone:

"Operation Phoenix has been running throughout the summer months and continues into autumn. It's having a positive effect on improving our service to the public, helping vulnerable people, tackling serious violence and preventing crime - and we've seen steady reductions in demand across these key areas.

"Today's activity really built on the momentum we've already achieved with our concerted efforts over the summer. In the last three months we arrested 100 people who were wanted on warrant or for recall to prison and today we have removed more wanted people from the streets - which can only help keep our communities safe.

"I'd like to thank my colleagues from across the force for their input today, as well as the support we have received from the community."
