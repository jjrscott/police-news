Officers are today releasing a new image of missing Alison Danks (also known as Bishop) which clearly shows what she was wearing on the night she went missing.

The image has been taken from CCTV footage and shows her walking along Redcar Road in Marske at 12:17am on Saturday 23rd May.

Alison was then sighted on CCTV near to Outwood Academy Bydales School on Coast Road in Marske at 12:22am later the same morning and hasn't been sighted since.

She can be clearly seen wearing a bright mustard coloured jacket and blue jeans. It is believed she was also wearing UGG boots.

Alison's brother, Matthew Bishop said: "Ali built up close and deep relationships with so many people who are now hurting since she went missing and we all want to see Alison return home safe and as soon as possible.

"Ali if you are reading this please just make contact by any means possible to let us know you are ok.

"If anyone has seen Ali and can get a message to us we will be eternally grateful. All that matters to our family is that we know Ali is ok."

Anyone with dashcam or private CCTV footage which could assist the investigation or anyone with any possible sightings of Alison late on Friday 22nd May into the early hours of Saturday 23rd May is asked to contact Cleveland Police on 101.
