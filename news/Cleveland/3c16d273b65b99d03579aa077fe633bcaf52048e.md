Over the last week, eight Cleveland Police officers have been reportedly been hit, headbutted, spat at and kicked whilst at work.

The alleged incidents have resulted in six people aged between 16 and 45 years old being arrested on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker.

Three people have been charged with the alleged offences and three people were released pending further enquiries.

Head of Local Policing, Chief Superintendent Thom McLoughlin said: "Police have a tough enough job without being attacked at work and I am appalled that some people think it is acceptable to attack officers.

"Police officers risk their own lives every day to protect our communities. Being assaulted is not part of the job and it will not be tolerated under any circumstances.

"Recently, the Home Secretary proposed tougher sentences for anyone found guilty of committing violent acts against police and I completely support this.

"Mindless acts of violence and aggression towards officers needs to stop and anyone behaving in this manner will be put before the courts to answer for their alleged crimes."
