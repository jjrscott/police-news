PCSOs from the Middlesbrough Neighbourhood Police Team executed a closure order at an owner occupied property on Wardale Avenue in Acklam, Middlesbrough on Monday 2nd December.

The closure order was made in partnership with Middlesbrough Council following reports of issues with drugs.

PSCO Mike Oakley, who led on this case alongside PCSO Michael Phillips, said: "The closure order was granted on Monday after a number of reports from members of the public regarding drugs activity at this property.

"The closure of the address sends out a clear message to the public that we do listen to them and we do not tolerate criminal activity. We will do everything we can to remove people causing distress in our communities and even if they own the property themselves, we can evict them."

Anyone with information on drugs activity in their local area is asked to contact police on 101 or report anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or online at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
