This morning, officers arrested two men on suspicion of firearms offences and one on suspicion of aggravated burglary.

The men were arrested in the Newtown and Thornaby areas of Stockton as part of Operation Sentinel to crack down on organised crime.

Â£3,500 in cash, incapacitant spray and suspected stolen gold jewellery was recovered during the arrests.

Acting Detective Chief Inspector Jon Tapper said: "The arrests made this morning send out a clear message that we will not tolerate organised crime in our area.

"Each of the men arrested were wanted for a number of alleged offences and our aim was to disrupt their criminal activity in a bid to prevent further misery being caused in our communities.

"I would like to thank all of the officers involved in today's activity and hope that this reassures the public that we will do everything possible to bring the offenders to justice."

The men remain in police custody at this time.
