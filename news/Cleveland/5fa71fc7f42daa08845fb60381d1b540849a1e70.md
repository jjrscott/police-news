Police are appealing to reunite a woman with "irreplaceable" items of jewellery stolen from her late father's home in Eaglescliffe.

The burglary took place on Woodford Green in Eaglescliffe, between 5pm on Sunday 24th January and 3pm on Monday 25th January.

The property had been ransacked by theives, who had emptied cupboards and drawers in the bedrooms, and took items including:

 * A Citizen Echo watch with a blue face, two dials and a silver metal strap.
 * A Tag Heur watch with a silver face.
 * A gold, square signet ring with the initials 'HJ' engraved
 * A gold, oval band style ring with an embossed pattern (which would be worn down due to age)
 * Five pairs of gold cufflinks
 * A silver pocket watch with a pattern. The watch was in a red box and the face was white and black with a black dial and roman numerals.

The items would collectively be worth thousands of pounds, however, they are extremely sentimental after the passing of the victim's father and she is now appealing to have them returned.

The victim, who wants to remain anonymous, said: "It's heartbreaking that someone has broken into my dad's home and stolen his things, these are items which would be precious to him. They are of extreme sentimental value to me and are irreplaceable.

"I am desperate to have the jewellery back, and would appeal to anyone who may have been offered the items for sale, or may know where they are, to get in touch with the police."

Anyone who may have been offered the items for sale or may know of their whereabouts, or anyone with information regarding the burglary, is asked to contact Police Staff Investigator Sharon Rountree from Stockton CID on the non-emergency number 101, quoting incident number 012981.

Independent charity Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111, or online at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
