For my September blog I'm asking you consider setting up a Neighbourhood Watch or reviving an existing scheme. It's completely free of charge to join, and remain a member too!

I've had a go at being a neighbourhood watch co-ordinator; I did the job for 15 years, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I must admit to being a big fan, I've seen first-hand the benefits that the movement can bring. I was part of a scheme that had just 26 houses in it, part of a much larger new housing estate. No-one knew their neighbours, however, in a short space of time the neighbours all knew each other and it created a strong sense of community and a group of life-long friends who all, still look out for each other.

The concept of Neighbourhood Watch came from the USA, where the first scheme was set up in 1964 and to the UK in 1982, with the first scheme set up in Cheshire.

The movement grew quickly throughout the UK and Cleveland saw that growth too, with thousands of schemes registered across our four policing areas of Redcar & Cleveland, Middlesbrough, Stockton and Hartlepool.

The aim of Neighbourhood Watch is to bring neighbours together to create strong, friendly, active communities where crime and anti-social behaviour are less likely to happen.

Neighbourhood Watch is about making sure that no one has to feel afraid, vulnerable or isolated in the place where they live.

So, this month, I'd like potential new co-ordinators and former co-ordinators to get in touch and either create or perhaps revive their scheme.
