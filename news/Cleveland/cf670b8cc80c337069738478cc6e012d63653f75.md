Officers are reminding business owners to be vigilant after 13 premises were burgled over the weekend and into this morning, Tuesday 31st March.

Businesses including a pub and supermarket have been targeted in Middlesbrough, Stockton, Hartlepool and Redcar.

Police do not believe there has been an increase in commercial burglaries but are expecting further businesses to be targeted as a result of the current climate with the coronavirus lockdown. Officers are reminding business owners of what they can do to help protect their premises from being targeted.

Please ensure cash is removed from any business premises or stored in a bolted down safe, make sure that stockrooms are locked and, where possible, keep stock out of sight and conceal the interior of your premises with shutters or by drawing blinds.

More information regarding protecting businesses can be found on the Cleveland Police website here: https://bit.ly/2QL4ETN

Anyone wishing to display a sign on their premises, stating that stock and cash are removed to deter thieves - can use the graphic below.
Please be assured that there are regular police patrols of local communities and these are continuing.

We would appeal to members of the public to support local businesses by notifying us if they see any suspicious activity on our non-emergency number 101. Always call 999 in an emergency.
