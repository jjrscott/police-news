Tomorrow, New Year's Day, marks three weeks since missing Natalie Jenkins, 32, was last seen.

A dedicated team of officers have been working solely on this investigation in a bid to find her. They have carried out searches of her property, analysed CCTV and her phone, interviewed people with potential sightings of her and are now following new lines of enquiries thanks to members of the public.

The last confirmed sighting of Natalie was at her home address on Westbury Street in Thornaby on Wednesday 11th December at 10am.

Detective Chief Inspector Matt Murphy King said: "The Force is extremely concerned for the whereabouts of Natalie. For a woman who is usually in touch with her family every day, it is so out of character for her not to be in touch, especially over Christmas and New Year.

"Three weeks is a very long time to not access your phone, personal possessions or to not contact your family. Someone out there must know where she is or has the information that can help us locate her.

"Natalie's family are desperate for answers and the Force would urge anyone with any information regarding her whereabouts to please urgently contact us."

Natalie is a white female, of very slim build, around 5'5" tall with a fair complexion and straight brown hair. She has hazel eyes and a missing front tooth. Natalie has a tattoo saying SWANN on her neck and another on her wrist saying SWANNY.

Anyone with information as to Natalie's whereabouts or anyone who may have seen her is asked to contact Cleveland Police on 101.

Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111 or online at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
