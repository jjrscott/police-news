Families working on the police frontline are doing all they can to help communities and deliver a service throughout the Covid-19 response.

Spouses, siblings and other relatives working for Cleveland Police are playing their part in helping to protect the NHS and save lives, whilst answering other calls for help.

Twins, Graeme and Marcus Carter, are helping to keep communities safe as police officers on Teesside. Graeme, is helping in the response to coronavirus through his role in specialist support and Marcus is working as a custody sergeant, dealing with criminal suspects and ensuring new working arrangements are adhered to, to keep people safe.

Graeme said: "I've been helping with the planning for officer's meals and some other aspects of Covid-19 for the Force. Everyone is having to adapt to new ways of working but we joined policing to help people, and I know my colleagues are proud of the work that they are doing."

Marcus added: "In custody, we have to use PPE and maintain social distancing as we have members of the public coming in and out. Often the people that come into custody are vulnerable, and we need to recognise that in the work we do."
