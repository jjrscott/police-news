Officers from the Stockton Neighbourhood Team stopped and searched the rider of a blue moped on Prince Regent Street in Stockton this afternoon, Monday 13th July.

A substantial amount of class A drugs was recovered from the male rider aged 25 and he was arrested on suspicion of drugs offences and remains in custody.

The team then searched a property in Thornaby in connection with the reported arrest and a further amount of class A drugs was recovered.

Stockton Neighbourhood Inspector Jon Willoughby said: "The proactive work conducted by my team has once again yielded fantastic results.

"Our officers are acting on the main concerns raised to us by our communities and we will continue to crack down on drugs activity and bring people to justice for their suspected crimes."

This is part of Cleveland Police's Operation Phoenix; a summer long operation to improve public service, prioritise vulnerability, tackle serious violence and prevent crime.
