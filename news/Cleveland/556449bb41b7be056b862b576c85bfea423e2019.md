Teessiders are being urged to continue to follow the government's stay at home guidance this bank holiday weekend as ignoring it will cost lives.

The restrictions remain in place, and people are being asked to fight the urge to meet with family and friends.

The Royal British Legion is also leading calls for the public to celebrate the 75th anniversary of VE Day from the safety of their homes.

Many of the national celebrations are being televised or live-streamed on the internet and people are being asked to commemorate the event with their own household in their homes or in their own gardens.

Chief Superintendent Thom McLoughlin said: "We're banking on our communities to work with us and continue to follow the guidance from the government this weekend.

"We know that Friday marks a key moment in our history and I know how keen our communities are to pay tribute, but public safety must be a top priority for us all.

"If we work together to stay at home and save lives, we will be able to come out of this much quicker. Please celebrate VE Day within your own home and your household group and keep following the guidance, including social distancing and the shielding of those most vulnerable.

"We are continuing our patrols and responding to calls from members of the public over this weekend and officers will speak to people and engage with them. We don't want to use enforcement action unless it is absolutely necessary, so we do need support from the public."

Information on the VE Day stay at home celebrations can be found here www.veday75.org or on local council websites. Information on the current restrictions can be found at www.gov.uk
