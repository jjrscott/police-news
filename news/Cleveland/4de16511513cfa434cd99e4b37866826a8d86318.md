Police are appealing for witnesses following a serious collision that occurred on Marton Road, near to the junction with Fife Street, at around 11:50pm yesterday, Thursday 26th December.

The collision involved a black Skoda Octavia and a pedestrian.

Officers believe there may have been two passengers in the Skoda who have not yet spoken to the police.

The 21-year-old pedestrian was taken to James Cook University Hospital where he remains receiving treatment for head injuries. He is described as being in a critical but stable condition.

The 52-year-old driver of the Skoda has been arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. He remains in custody whilst enquiries are ongoing.

Officers are appealing for these potential two passengers, and any other possible witnesses, to contact PC Ivan Hughes via the non-emergency number 101, quoting the event number 218644.
