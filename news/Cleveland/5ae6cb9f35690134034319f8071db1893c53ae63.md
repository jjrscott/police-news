Yesterday, Tuesday 3rd March, officers from the Stockton Neighbourhood Team and the Operational Support Unit executed a drugs warrant in Billingham.

Class A drugs and weapons were seized from a property on Knole Road which resulted in six people being arrested (five men and one woman).

Stockton Neighbourhood Team Sergeant, John Sproson said: "Drugs cause nothing but misery in our communities and we will do everything we can to disrupt drugs activity.

"We hope yesterday's drugs warrant sends out a clear message that we are listening to people living in communities affected by drugs and we will always act on intelligence in relation to drug related crime."

The six people arrested have been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Anyone reporting information regarding drugs activity in their local area can contact Cleveland Police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
