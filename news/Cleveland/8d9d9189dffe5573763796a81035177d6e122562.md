Following police enquiries, it is believed that the man may have sustained his injuries at a house on nearby Violet Close.

The man was taken to James Cook University Hospital where he remains in a life-threatening condition.

Assistant Chief Constable Steve Graham said: "This was a savage attack and a full police investigation is underway to locate and apprehend those involved. We are following a number of lines of enquiry, one of which is that those involved may have been known to each other, however the investigation is still at an early stage and it would not be appropriate to go into detail at this time.

"As well as officers involved in the investigation, additional neighbourhood patrols are operating in the area to offer reassurance and as a point of contact should any local people wish to pass on any information about the incident.

"I would urge the public to support our officers and come forward with any information they may have about this vicious attack. We will act swiftly on information received as we seek to bring those involved to justice."

Anyone with information regarding the incident is asked to contact Cleveland Police on the non-emergency number 101, quoting event number 182863, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
