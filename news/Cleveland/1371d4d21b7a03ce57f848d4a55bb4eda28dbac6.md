Last Friday 26th June, officers from Cleveland and North Yorkshire's Road Policing Units conducted a joint operation aimed at heavy goods vehicles carrying dangerous goods.

16 vehicles were stopped in total at Exelby services on the A19 which resulted in three prohibitions being issued, two for transport document offences and one for carrying dangerous goods without displaying appropriate vehicle markings.

Another five vehicles were found to be in breach of the regulations for a range of minor non-compliance issues, resulting in the companies being contacted and being served with advice notices.

The aim of the operation was for officers to look at offences including tachograph offences, faulty brake lights, under-inflated wheels, document offences and having the correct signage for the substances that the vehicles carry.

The same operation was conducted at Seal Sands on Thursday 25th June where the same amount of vehicles were pulled over where several minor issues were identified relating to vehicles not being labelled correctly. Advice notices were sent to two companies where the offences that were identified required the company concerned to take action to remedy the breach.

A Cleveland Police spokesperson said: "It is important that we work together with neighbouring Forces to ensure drivers have the correct documents in place to drive their vehicles whilst carrying hazardous goods.

"This is to ensure the safety of the drivers and other motorists and officers will continue to carry out operations like this to help keep people travelling on our roads as safe as possible."
