Stockton Neighbourhood Officers carried out a drugs warrant on Friday 3rd April at a property on St Peters Road in Stockton where a small amount of class A drugs were recovered from the property.

On the same day, neighbourhood officers were patrolling The Green in Billingham when they stopped and searched a man on a motorbike. A large amount of class B drugs, cash and phones were recovered from the man aged 29 and he was arrested on suspicion of possessing drugs with intent to supply and released under investigation.

The motorbike was also seized.

Officers then conducted a search at a nearby property with assistance from Police Dog Chip and a substantial amount of class A and B drugs was recovered. A 34-year-old male was arrested on suspicion of possessing drugs with intent to supply and released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Stockton Neighbourhood Sergeant John Sproson said: "We always act on intelligence from members of the public and we hope the arrests show our communities that officers will be continuing to crack down on drugs activity throughout the coronavirus lockdown in a bid to keep the streets of Stockton safe."
