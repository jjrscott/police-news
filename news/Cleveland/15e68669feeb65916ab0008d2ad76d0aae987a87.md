Special Constables from Cleveland Special Constabulary conducted a roads policing operation last weekend to target drivers and vehicles.

The Special Constables targeted vehicles without insurance or tax and drivers without a license as well as any drivers under the influence of alcohol. Police also provided advice to drivers around vehicle defects.

Almost 130 drivers were breathalysed in Middlesbrough and Stockton and, thankfully, no one was over the drink drive limit.

In addition to this, officers also issued the below sanctions:

 * 12 VDRS (Vehicle Defect Rectification Notices)
 * 3 fixed penalty notices
 * 2 DVLA forms for no tax
 * 3 seizures of vehicles for various offences (including no insurance & no tax)
 * 2 Traffic Offence Reports

T/Chief Superintendent Alison Jackson said: "Today is International Volunteers Day and this operation is one of the many great examples of work conducted by our Special Constables and volunteers in our Force on a daily basis.

"I am incredibly proud of these individuals who sacrifice so much of their time to train and work for the Force. Many of the roles are extremely demanding but very rewarding.

"Each of the volunteers play a vital role in keeping our neighbourhoods safe and they offer huge support to our officers and staff. I would like to thank each and every one of them for their hard work and dedication."
