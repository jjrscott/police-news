Police are reminding members of the public to please not make unnecessary journeys in vehicles during the coronavirus outbreak and to only travel when essential.

Around 20 people have been issued with warnings this afternoon and told to return home by officers in Portrack in Stockton.

A Cleveland Police spokesperson said: "We are seeing people out today who are making non-essential journeys to buy items such as log burners, paint and garden equipment.

"Officers will engage, encourage and explain the reasons why people should be returning home before enforcement is used.

"We would like to remind people to stay at home, not only to potentially save their own lives but also the lives of others and to protect the NHS."

People are only allowed to leave the house for specific reasons:

 * Shopping for "basic necessities", as infrequently as possible
 * One form of exercise a day such as a run, walk or cycle - please note: travelling in a vehicle to another location to exercise or walk a dog is NOT classed as essential travel and officers will advise you to do this closer to home.
 * Medical reasons, to provide care, or to help a vulnerable person
 * Travelling to and from work, but only if it is "absolutely necessary" and cannot be done from home

For people not adhering to the rules, new powers mean officers can:

 * ensure parents are doing all they can to stop their children breaking the rules
 * issue a £60 fixed penalty
 * issue a £120 fixed penalty for second-time offenders, doubling on each further repeat offence

Anyone who does not pay can be taken to court, with magistrates able to impose unlimited fines. If they still refuse to comply, police can arrest them.
