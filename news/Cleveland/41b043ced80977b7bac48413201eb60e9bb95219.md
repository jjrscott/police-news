Detectives carried out a search in the garden of a property on Briar Road in Thornaby today, Tuesday 14th January, in connection with the suspected murder of Naheed Khan, 43.

Deputy Investigating Officer, Detective Inspector Louise Sproson, said: "The search today could potentially lead detectives to Naheed's whereabouts and is part of a series of planned searches our dedicated team will be carrying out early this year.

"We have received a vast amount of intelligence to date and our detectives are currently investigating over 1800 evidential documents, 670 statements and over 4,600 actions (lines of enquiries to follow up). Our team are committed to finding Naheed and bringing those responsible to justice.

"Someone out there knows what has happened to Naheed. I strongly believe that someone is withholding crucial information and I would urge them to come forward and assist officers with enquiries."

Naheed, 43, has been missing since early May bank holiday 2018 had links to Stockton, Middlesbrough and Thornaby. She is described as Asian, of slim build and around 5ft 6" tall, with long, dark hair.
