Three men were arrested in connection with a knifepoint robbery after police dog Harley tracked down the suspects and found suspected stolen goods.

A knifepoint robbery was reported to police around 7:55pm on Wednesday 27th January, at the Saver Store on Grange Road, Middlesbrough, whereby two males entered the store with a knife and wearing balaclavas, and made off with cash, cigarettes and alcohol.

Officers including police dog handler Liam Sewell and police dog Harley attended the scene, and Harley soon picked up a scent which led them to a block of flats, where two men were found with suspected stolen goods.

Two men aged 34 and 40 were arrested on suspicion of robbery and a third male, aged 49, was also arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit robbery. All three men remain in police custody at this time.

Anyone with further information is asked to contact Cleveland Police on 101, quoting incident number 014108.
