A man, 45, was given a 23-week sentence (suspended for 12 months) and ordered to pay compensation to two police officers following an assault in March.

The incident occurred on Wednesday 25th March when police were called to an incident at a property on Belk Street in Hartlepool.

On police arrival, officers tried to escort a man out of a property when one was punched in the face and another was kicked and bitten.

The man was sentenced at Teesside Crown Court yesterday, Monday 11th May where he pleaded guilty to the offences.

At the time of the incident, Superintendent Sharon Cooney said: "Police put their lives at risk every day by protecting members of the public, and especially now with the crisis surrounding coronavirus.

"Attacking our officers whilst they are carrying out their duties is absolutely disgraceful. Police are under enough pressure keeping the people living in our communities safe without being assaulted.

"Officers are continuing to work as normal whilst a majority of people are staying at home in order to keep safe and they shouldn't have to deal with the risk of being attacked.

"The Force will not tolerate this behaviour under any circumstances and I want to make it clear that you will be brought to justice if you are caught assaulting or abusing any of our officers."
