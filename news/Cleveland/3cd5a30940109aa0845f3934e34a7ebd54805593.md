National Cyber Security Centre has released 'Cyber Aware' campaign this week which aims to provide advice and guidance to the public on how to protect yourself online.

The campaign urges people to protect their data passwords, the accounts they protect and the devices they use to access them.

The campaign also encourages people to 'Stay home. Stay Connected. Stay Cyber Aware', and their top tips for staying secure online are;

 1. Turn on two factor authentication for important accounts
 2. Protect important accounts using a password of three random words
 3. Create a separate password that you only use for your main email account
 4. Update the software and apps on your devices regularly (ideally set to 'automatically update')
 5. Save your passwords in your browser
 6. To protect yourself from being held to ransom, back up important data

You can find out more about the campaign at: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberaware

With many people in the UK trying video conferencing for the first time, the advice includes top tips on securely installing the app, creating a strong password and tracking who is joining the chat.

We also recommend that you do not make meetings public, connect only to people through your contacts or address book - and to never post the link or password publicly.

You can read the guidance on the video conferencing guidance and find more advice regarding cyber security at www.ncsc.gov.uk.
