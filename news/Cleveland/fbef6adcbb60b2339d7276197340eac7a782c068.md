The heartbroken family of a man who sadly died on Sunday 5th April have today paid tribute and released a photo of him.

Anthony Shaw, 42, died following an incident at a property on Smith Street in Stockton (a small street off Stockton High Street) on Friday 3rd April.

His mum said today: "Anthony was a loving and caring son, brother and uncle who will be greatly missed by all who knew him, especially his family.

"To lose him in such circumstances is devastating and we really need answers to determine how Anthony came to die and we would ask anyone with information to come forward to police. Our family needs to know what happened to him".

Anthony's dad added: "Please give the police, no matter how insignificant you think the information is, the help and evidence needed to solve this investigation.

"We feel total devastation that our beautiful son Anthony, a loving caring soul has died and this has been a heart wrenching ordeal for our family."

Five men aged 20, 26, 28, 23 and 22 and one woman aged 30 were arrested on suspicion of murder and have been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

If you have any information regarding the incident please contact Detective Sergeant Lindsey Dale from Cleveland Police on 101 quoting 051824.
