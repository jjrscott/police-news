On Friday 3rd January at 9:45pm, officers were called to a report of a stolen Seat Ibiza in Middlesbrough.

Officers soon spotted the vehicle and a pursuit occurred, resulting in the driver fleeing from the car.

Shortly after, PC Rashad and PD Rocky from the Dog Unit set to work in a bid to try and find the suspect.

PD Rocky managed to track the suspect hiding in the garden of a property half a mile away.

A 14-year-old male was arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle, driving without insurance, failing to stop and driving without a license. He has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Rocky's handler, PC Mo Rashad said: "This is an excellent example of how powerful and skilled police dogs are. Rocky managed to track the suspect in the garden of a property in a cul-de-sac straight away.

"Had it not been for the dog, it was highly unlikely the suspect would have been located due to where he was hiding. The result shows the importance of police dogs and how vital they are in the fight against crime. I am so proud of Rocky for his hard work in this incident."
