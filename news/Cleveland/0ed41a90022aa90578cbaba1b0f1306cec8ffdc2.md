Police are today providing crime prevention advice on how people can keep valuables such as jewellery safe in their homes.

Thefts of precious jewellery of sentimental value can be devastating for victims. Police recommend that as well as storing jewellery out of sight and making sure your home is secure, families should consider:

\- Securing jewellery in a Safety Deposit Centre, registered with the Financial Conduct Authority

\- Photographing all items and registering them securely with www.immobilise.com to reduce thieves' ability to sell them

\- Property marking your jewellery to deter theft and increase your chances of getting items back

\- Installing a concealed and immovable safe: There are two options - either a home safe or a safety deposit vault.

If you opt for a safe in your home, make sure it's fire rated. Home safes are also insurance rated according to the type and value of items designed to be kept inside, so check with your insurance company first to make sure you're adequately covered.

Position the safe carefully so it won't be easily discovered. Don't put it in your bedroom as this is the first place a burglar will look.

Make sure you bolt your safe to a wall or floor.

If you have a large amount of family gold or jewellery, consider using a safety deposit vault. This removes the risk of storing valuables in your own home and can also make your home less of a target to burglars.

Contact your insurance company should you opt for this, as it may affect your current policy and premium.
