4,000 people have given their views on neighbourhood policing, and others are urged to have their say before the Cleveland Police survey closes next week.

Under the banner of 'Our Conversation', the survey seeks to find out what local people see as priorities for the area they live, and how they want neighbourhood policing to be delivered.

The results from the survey will be looked at alongside other information available to the Force, and a new neighbourhood policing model will be put into place.

Chief Constable Richard Lewis said: "I'm pleased that 4,000 people have engaged with the survey so far. It's important that we listen to the views of residents when we make decisions about policing in their communities.

"I would urge those who want to have their say to complete the survey if they haven't already."

The survey can be completed by clicking on this link https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/OCNeighbourhoods/, it is also available in local police stations and officers and staff will be reaching out to local communities to ask for their views.
