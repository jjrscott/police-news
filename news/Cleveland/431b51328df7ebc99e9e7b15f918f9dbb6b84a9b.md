"Enquiries continue to suggest the man was attacked in a house on Violet Close before making his way on foot the short distance to a second residential property on nearby Waterford Road. We are asking anyone who was in the area at the time of the attack and who may have seen or heard anything suspicious to come forward.

"One line of enquiry at this time is that several people may have been involved in the attack and these individuals would then have left Violet Close and made off. Two arrests have been made this afternoon - a man aged 33 and a man aged 46 - and a number of lines of enquiry are being actively pursued.

"Did you see anyone acting suspiciously in the area yesterday evening? You may have important information that could help bring an offender or offenders to justice. Anyone with information regarding the incident is asked to contact Cleveland Police on the non-emergency number 101, quoting event number 182863, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
