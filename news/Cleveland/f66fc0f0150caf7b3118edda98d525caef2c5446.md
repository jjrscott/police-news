A family have paid tribute to their beloved son, brother, dad and granddad after he died following an alleged incident outside The Roundel Pub in Thornaby on Tuesday 17th September.

A family have paid tribute to their beloved son, brother, dad and granddad after he died following an alleged incident outside The Roundel Pub in Thornaby on Tuesday 17th September.

"He had some great friends in the Golden Eagle, which he never went far from unless we were all together.

"Anto wasn't an angel when he was younger. He was always up to some mischief with his cousin or mates. He liked to go fishing with his sons at the weekend and sometimes we would go camping. It was a great laugh and he would always have a big, daft smile on his face. Anto is now reunited with his dad."

Following the alleged incident, a 39-year-old man was charged with manslaughter and he appeared at Teesside Magistrates Court on Thursday 19th September.
