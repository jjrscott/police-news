Colleagues from Humberside Police were called to a report of a body on the beach at Grimston in East Yorkshire on Monday 15th June, at 9:40am.

Officers from Cleveland Police were informed and we can now sadly confirm that the body has been identified as that of missing 39-year-old Alison Danks (also known as Bishop) from Marske.

Alison's family have been informed and specialist officers will continue to support them. Our thoughts remain with them at this extremely difficult time.

The death is not being treated as suspicious and a file has been prepared for the Coroner.
