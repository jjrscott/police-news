From conducting primary surveys and putting casualties into the recovery position to dealing with minor head injuries and applying bandages to cuts, youngsters from four primary schools are now qualified in first aid after taking part in a session with St John Ambulance.

Cleveland's Police Mini Police graduates from Thorntree, Corpus Christi, North Ormesby and St Alphonsus' schools (all Middlesbrough) took part in practical and theory exercises on Monday adding to their growing skills set which they develop through the Mini Police programme.

PCSO Lindsey Blackburn who co-ordinates the Force's ten Mini Police units said:
"It was very exciting to run our very first Mini Police First Aid session and I'd like to thank St John Ambulance, the children and their schools for their support.

"Feedback from the Mini Police - and their teachers - was very positive and I plan to deliver this session to our next set of Mini Police graduates in the coming weeks and months."
