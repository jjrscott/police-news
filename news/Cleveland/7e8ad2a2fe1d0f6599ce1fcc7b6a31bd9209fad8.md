Local beat bobbies will go back into Loftus Police Station as part of Cleveland Police's commitment to re-energise neighbourhood policing.

PCs and PCSOs who patrol Loftus will be based permanently at the building on West Road in the town and will begin and end their shifts there.
In 2016, neighbourhood police officers moved from Loftus to a new base at Guisborough Police Station while continuing to patrol the area.

The Loftus station needs some initial renovation work but it is anticipated that officers will be working from there before Christmas. The building will not be open to the public initially but the Force is working with partner agencies to explore the option of a publicly accessible front desk.

The change to Loftus is part of a new plan to reinvest into neighbourhoods. Over the coming months, police leaders will be asking the public what they want from neighbourhood policing, and will look at ways in which police can better engage with communities.

T/Chief Superintendent - Dave Sutherland said: "We know our residents want visible and accessible neighbourhood policing presence and for local officers know their area inside and out. We have given a commitment to re-energise and reinvest into our neighbourhoods and Loftus is the first step in our new plan.

"Local councillors have told us that want a front desk facility and we are looking at what the possibilities might be with partner agencies, taking into account the views of local residents."
