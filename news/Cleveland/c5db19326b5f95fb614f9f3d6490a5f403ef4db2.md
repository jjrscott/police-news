Police are today reminding drivers to check their tread as Thursday 1st October marks the beginning of National Tyre Safety Month.

The awareness raising month is organised by TyreSafe, who are encouraging drivers to check the air pressure, condition and tread depth on their tyres at least once a month and prior to long journeys.

Roads policing officers from the Cleveland and Durham Specialist Operations Unit are supporting the campaign, with regular tyre safety messaging being posted on their dedicated social media pages throughout October.

Inspector Jamie Bell, from the Cleveland and Durham Specialist Operations Unit, said: "It's really important to regularly check tyres for any wear, damage or deflation which could put your safety, or the safety of others, at risk on our roads.

"Tyres which aren't maintained properly could affect things like braking and steering and if they're unsafe they could ultimately contribute towards collisions, putting people at risk unnecessarily.

"Throughout October we will be sharing messaging on our social media sites around tyre safety in the hope that people will check their tyres regularly and prior to any longer journeys."

All vehicle makes and models have their own requirements and drivers are asked to check their manufacturers handbook for details or visit a local specialist for advice.
