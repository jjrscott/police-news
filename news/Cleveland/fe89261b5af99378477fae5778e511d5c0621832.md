Detectives investigating the disappearance of suspected murder victim, Natalie Jenkins, 32, are continuing to appeal to the public for information in a bid to try and trace her last steps.

Natalie was last seen walking along Parliament Road on Tuesday 10th December at 7:55pm and her movements after this are currently unknown.

Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Chief Inspector Mark Dimelow, said: "We are urgently appealing to the public for sightings of Natalie after 7:55pm.

"If you were in the central Middlesbrough area around the time of her last sighting and noticed Natalie who was wearing a burgundy coat with a light coloured hat, please come forward.

"Detectives are still working through CCTV footage to try and piece together her last movements but we desperately need the public to come forward and assist with any information they have.

"Someone out there knows where Natalie went and what has happened to her and I would urge this person, to do the right thing and come forward, for the sake of Natalie's family."

Natalie is a white female, of very slim build, around 5'5" tall with a fair complexion and straight brown hair. She has hazel eyes and a missing front tooth. Natalie has a tattoo saying SWANNY on her neck and another on her wrist saying SWANN.

Anyone with information as to Natalie's whereabouts or anyone who may have seen her, is asked to contact Cleveland Police on 101.

Independent charity Crimestoppers is now offering a reward of up to Â£10,000 for information they receive that leads to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the suspected murder of Natalie Jenkins.

Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111 or online at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
