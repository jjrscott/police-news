Police are appealing for information after a man aged 65 was assaulted whilst walking his dog along the railway line which runs off Claxton Close in Hardwick.

The incident occurred on Saturday 6th February at around 8am when the victim was approached by a man who asked him for directions and a lighter. The man then hit the victim across the head, causing him to fall to the ground and then he kicked him.

It is believed at the time of the incident a woman wearing a long black rain coat who was walking a small dog had walked past just before the victim was assaulted and officers are appealing for this woman to come forward as she may be able to assist with enquiries.

The man responsible is described as being a white male, 6 ft tall, of slim build and clean shaven. He was wearing black tracksuit bottoms and a white hoody underneath a coat.

The victim attended hospital following the incident and was treated for minor injuries.

Anyone with information regarding the incident or the person responsible is asked to contact Cleveland Police on 101 quoting 022642.

Information can be given anonymously via Crimestoppers online at www.crimestoppers-uk.org or by phoning 0800 555 111.
