The family of Christopher Kay, 58, from Carlin How, who sadly died following a reported incident on Brotton Road in Carlin How on Friday 21st August are today releasing a new photo and tribute to him.

Christopher's family said today: "It has now been over two weeks since our family lost Chris. It is difficult to put into words the void that has been left, knowing we are unable to speak to him one last time. Our children and grandchildren now cannot speak with their dad and granddad.

"We are taking comfort from the kind words from Chris's friends and those within the local community, who remember him as someone who was a friendly, pleasant guy, who would do anything for anyone.

"We have many memories which cannot be taken away from us and we will remember Chris for his passion for cars and his hobby, fishing. We have heard from some of his friends who knew him through his love of fishing, and know he is missed there, too.

"We are still unable to comprehend what happened to Chris and we would again like to thank those members of the public who helped Chris; the emergency services, the police officers working on the case and the specialist officers who continue to support us.

"We politely ask that we continue to be left to grieve in private."

Cleveland Police is still appealing for witnesses, or anyone with CCTV/dash-cam footage from the time/ area of the reported incident, who has not already spoken to police to contact on 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or online at: www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
