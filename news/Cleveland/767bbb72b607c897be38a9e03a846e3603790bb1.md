Cleveland Police are today releasing a series of new images of Natalie Jenkins, 32, who police believe may have been murdered.

The new images are the most up-to-date images that officers currently have of her.

Natalie was last sighted on Parliament Road in Middlesbrough on Tuesday 10th December 2019 and as part of their ongoing investigation officers have been trying to trace her last steps in a bid to find her.

Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Chief Inspector Mark Dimelow said: "Previously, we have only had one recent photo of Natalie to release to the public and the images we are releasing today clearly show what she looked like just a month before she went missing.

"The images were sent to officers as a result of previous appeals and are taken from CCTV footage at a shop in Stokesley in mid-November 2019.

"We hope the photos provide the public with a clearer image of what Natalie looked like when she went missing in the hope that someone may come forward with information regarding any sightings of her on Tuesday 10th or Wednesday 11th December 2019.

"We would urge anyone with information regarding Natalie's whereabouts, or anyone who may have seen her on these dates to contact police as a matter of urgency. Your information could be a key piece of evidence which could assist us with our investigation."

Natalie is a white female, of very slim build, around 5'5" tall with a fair complexion and straight brown hair. She has hazel eyes and a missing front tooth. Natalie has a tattoo saying SWANNY on her neck and another on her wrist saying SWANN.

Anyone with information as to Natalie's whereabouts or anyone who may have seen her, is asked to contact Cleveland Police on 101.

Independent charity Crimestoppers is now offering a reward of up to Â£10,000 for information they receive that leads to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the suspected murder of Natalie Jenkins: https://bit.ly/2ufI0Lq
