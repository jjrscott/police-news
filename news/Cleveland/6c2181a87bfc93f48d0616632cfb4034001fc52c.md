Have fun but stay safe and know your limits is the message from police ahead of many pubs and bars reopening in July.

From Saturday 4th July many pubs and bars across Cleveland, which had closed as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic, will be able to reopen with restrictions designed to protect the public from Coronavirus.

Ahead of the reopening of bars and pubs, Cleveland Police has issued an appeal to people to know their limits, plan their day in advance and consider how you will get home safely.

Superintendent Emily Harrison said: "We understand that many people will want to take advantage of this opportunity as soon as possible, especially after having been unable to do so for so long.

"Whilst we of course want people to have a good time and enjoy themselves, we must remember that Coronavirus is still a serious risk to health. As such, people need to continue to follow the Government's guidance to mitigate the transmission of the virus, including social distancing, increased hygiene measures and following the instructions of staff.

"We urge people to drink responsibly, follow the guidance set out and maintain a safe environment for everyone. The vast majority of drinkers are responsible but we know some people will drink to excess and become vulnerable to harm or indeed cause harm to others.

"The key advice is to know your limits, plan your day and consider how you will get home safely. Anti-social and criminal behaviour is not acceptable and Cleveland Police continue to work with local authorities and others to maximise safety and cut crime."
