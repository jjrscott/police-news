Officers have arrested more than 750 people in connection with reported knife crime offences so far in 2020 and the Force is once again supporting Operation Sceptre, a national campaign which aims to raise awareness of knife crime and tackle it.

The week long campaign begins today, Monday 9th November.

Despite being in the midst of a national lockdown, officers are taking the opportunity to raise awareness of knife crime.

Detective Chief Inspector Wendy Tinkler said: "Since January this year the Force has arrested 767 people in relation to reported knife crime which has resulted in 257 charges, 17 juvenile triages and two summons to court.

"Knives and sharp objects are extremely dangerous if they are in the wrong hands and our aim is to educate people on the dangers of carrying knives and the consequences people will face for committing knife related crime.

"In September, a 19 year old male was sentenced to just under two years in a young offender's institution for threatening someone with a machete with a blade at least 18 inches in length. This offence will no doubt impact on his future and his career prospects.

"Last year we introduced permanent knife bins at each of the four main police stations in Middlesbrough, Stockton, Hartlepool and Redcar and Cleveland. Lockdown restrictions will affect our ability to conduct our usual knife surrender and we would ask the public to follow local government guidelines and surrender weapons when lockdown restrictions are lifted when it is safe to do so.

"We do recognise that there will be situations when individuals may be particularly concerned about storing knives and sharp implements. If you have any concerns, particularly in relation to any immediate safety issues please call 101.

 "Always call 999 in an emergency.

"Crimestoppers can also be contacted anonymously by phoning 0800 555 111 or online at www.crimestoppers-uk.org."
