Jamie Bullock aged 33 from Durham Road in Stockton was sentenced to 15 months in prison at Teesside Crown Court today for possessing class B drugs with intent to supply.

Bullock was sentenced following an incident on Hartington Road in Stockton on Friday 18th September after being sighted on CCTV dealing drugs on his bicycle.

PC McPhillips and PC Caley from the Stockton Neighbourhood Team were patrolling on their bicycles in plain clothes nearby and managed to track Bullock down (as shown in the footage) and arrest him.

The footage shoes Bullock riding ahead wearing a red top and soon after PC McPhillips chases him down with PC Caley assisting in the arrest soon after.

Stockton Neighbourhood T/Chief Inspector Jon Hagen said: "This was fantastic police work by both officers and a great example of how plain clothes officers are useful in our communities to track down criminals.

"The Force will not tolerate any form of criminality involving drugs. They cause nothing but misery to the people living in our areas.

"We hope the people living in our communities are happy with Bullocks' sentencing knowing that another criminal has been taken off the streets and is paying for his crimes."

Sentenced: Jamie Bullock aged 33 from Durham Road
