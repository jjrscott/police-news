We know that this has been a really tough year for people in our communities. As we head into the winter months, it's going to be an uncertain time as we all try to adjust to the new Coronavirus restrictions that come into place.

Throughout this pandemic, we have seen local people pull together to reach those in need, to celebrate and thank our keyworkers, and to join together as volunteers to offer a helping hand.

The grit and determination showed by people living and working in Hartlepool, Redcar and Cleveland, Middlesbrough and Stockton has been tremendous. We now need to pull together again to help protect the NHS and save lives.

We all have a personal responsibility to reduce the spread of the virus by following the regulations.

Throughout, we have spoken to people in communities to help them understand the rules in place, and offered advice and information if they have been unsure.

We have also taken enforcement action against people who flout the rules and endanger lives. We won't waste time with endless encouragement for those who knowingly or deliberately break the rules. People recklessly ignoring the regulations should expect to receive a fixed penalty notice. When we receive reports of suspected breaches we will respond if it is proportionate to do so, whilst balancing with the demand that we have at that time.

As we again make sacrifices and adjust to the new measures in place, we will work alongside our communities to pull together and protect each other.
