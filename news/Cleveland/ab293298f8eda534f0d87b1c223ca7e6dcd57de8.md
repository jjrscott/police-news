Officers are warning residents of Redcar to be vigilant after two elderly victims were targeted by a bogus caller on Monday 25th January.

The incidents occurred between 4:30pm and 5:30pm.

One of the incidents occurred at a property on Green How Walk when a man approached the property and said he needed to check the house for leaks. He entered the house and stole money from a purse.

A second incident occurred on Ayton Drive when a male approach the property and claimed he was from Northumbria Water and needed to check the house for possibilities of flooding. He entered the property and stole money from a purse and then left.

It is believed the same male is responsible for both incidents. He is described as being a white male, of medium height and build and spoke with a local accent. It is thought he is aged between 20-30years old. He was wearing a black face mask, a black baseball cap with a NY cream motif on the front and dark clothing.

We would like to hear from anyone who could help identify this man or who may have captured him on private CCTV or dash cam footage.

We would also remind residents to be careful if they are contacted by people stating their property needs urgent work carrying out. Members of the public should not feel pressured to agree to work while cold callers are on the doorstep and should use reputable companies.

Anyone with information which could help police is asked to contact Cleveland Police on 101 quoting 013074 (Green How Walk) or 013339 (Ayton Drive).

Information can also be passed anonymously to Crimestoppers via its website at www.crimestoppers-uk.org or by phoning them on 0800 555 111.
