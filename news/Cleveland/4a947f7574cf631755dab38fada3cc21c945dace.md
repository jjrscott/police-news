Today, Friday 22nd November, officers partnered with the Environment Agency, HMRC, Immigration and DVSA in a multi-agency approach to tackling crime in Newport, Middlesbrough.

The new approach is called Operation Stronghold and officers and colleagues patrolled Newport on foot and in vehicles and stopped vehicles suspected of being involved in vehicle crime, drugs offences or other crime.

Over the eight hour period, six vehicles were recovered for various reasons including not having tax, insurance or a driver without a license. The vehicles recovered were a Ford Transit x 2, Ford Fusion, Mercedes, VW Polo and a Citroen Picasso.

In addition to this, stop checks were conducted which resulted in a male, 14, being arrested on suspicion of possessing class B drugs and he was also wanted on warrant. The male remains in custody and a small amount of drugs were recovered from him.

T/ Neighbourhood Sergeant Steve Pattinson said: "Today's operation has been a success, we have seized vehicles which could have potentially caused danger to people in our communities.

"This operation is a new approach to tackling crime with partner agencies and I would like to thank the team today for their hard work and for making the operation a success."

Police and Crime Commissioner Barry Coppinger added: "I welcome this ongoing operation by Cleveland Police and I know it will be welcome by many of the residents who I have spoken to over recent weeks and months and I hope we can continue to make progress in the future."
