Crime prevention officers are asking people to be vigilant after three burglaries at properties in Middlesbrough and Stockton, believed to be targeting jewellery.

The burglaries happened on Spenborough Road in Elm Tree, Stockton, at around 5.30pm on Tuesday 26th November; Virginia Gardens in Kader, Middlesbrough, at around 9.45pm on Wednesday 27th November and Chalford Oaks in Ayresome, Middlesbrough, at around 8.15pm on Thursday 28th November.

Two men, described as "broad", were seen making off from the burglary on Spenborough Road.

Thousands of pounds worth of family jewellery was stolen in the burglaries, and police are continuing to investigate these incidents. No arrests have been made at present.

Officers are advising people on how to keep their jewellery safe, by issuing advice including:

 * Ensure that doors and windows are locked in your property, whether you are in or out of the house.
 * When you are not wearing your jewellery keep it somewhere safe and out of sight.
 * Invest in a lockable, concealed and immovable safe for your home and use it.
 * Consider placing your valuables in a safety deposit centre. It is recommended that you use a centre registered with the Financial Conduct Authority.
 * Invest in a burglar alarm and remember to turn it on.
 * Insure your jewellery.
 * Take photographs of your jewellery and register them on the free, secure online database www.immobilise.com.
 * Security mark your jewellery with a DNA property marking kit.

Anyone who may have information regarding the incidents is asked to contact Cleveland Police on the non-emergency number 101.
