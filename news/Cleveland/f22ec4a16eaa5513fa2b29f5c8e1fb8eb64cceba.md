The detective leading the investigation into the murder of Steven Clark is appealing for an anonymous letter writer to come forward and speak to the new investigation team.

On 24th September 1999 an anonymous handwritten letter relating to Steven's disappearance was posted to Guisborough Police Station.

Records show that at the time, the letter was assessed by officers and the information was recorded. Now, Detective Chief Inspector Shaun Page is appealing for the letter writer to call Crimestoppers anonymously and give them any additional information that they may have.

The latest appeal comes as specialist search teams begin searches in the Marske-by-the-Sea area this morning. Officers are carrying out land searches today a bid to find Steven.

Detectives from the Cleveland and North Yorkshire Cold Case Unit reopened the case and have been conducting an investigation into the circumstances of his disappearance. As a result of this, and due to there being no proof of life, detectives believe that Steven has come to serious harm and a murder inquiry has been launched.

Two people have been arrested on suspicion of the murder of Steven, and they remain on police bail pending further investigation.

Steven was 23 when he went missing. The missing persons report said that Steven was last seen at 3pm after a family walk on Monday 28th December 1992. The report says that he went to use the gents' toilets near to the pier on the promenade in Saltburn, when his mum went into the ladies at the same time, but he wasn't seen coming out of the toilets and did not return home.

Detectives launched an appeal this week and have had calls from people who knew Steven and want to provide information.

Detective Chief Inspector Shaun Page said: "For operational reasons I can't divulge the contents or topic of the letter, but it was sent through the post and addressed to the incident room at Guisborough Police Station.

"The person who sent it may know more that could help our inquiry team. They obviously felt compelled to write the letter seven years after his disappearance and I would like to hear from them again now.

"It's clear from the response that we have had overall from the public that a lot of people knew Steven from living in Marske. I would like to thank the local community for their cooperation in this investigation so far. We do still want people to come forward and tell us if they knew Steven or if they have any information that would benefit the inquiry.

"They can call us, upload information online, or call Crimestoppers completely anonymously.

"People in the area local to Marske may see us carrying out initial land searches today, and these searches will continue as part of our ongoing investigation."

Anyone with information can use the Cleveland Police section of the Major Incident Public Portal via this link https://mipp.police.uk/ call Cleveland Police on the non-emergency number 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
