This month marks a year since detectives launched an investigation into the suspected murder of Naheed Khan, 43.

A dedicated team of officers will be carrying out a series of searches early this year after receiving intelligence which could potentially lead detectives to Naheed's whereabouts.

For operational reasons, the details of the searches are not being revealed until they have taken place.

Officers are still continuing to appeal to the public for information regarding the disappearance of Naheed.

Naheed, 43, had links to Stockton, Middlesbrough and Thornaby. She is described as Asian, of slim build and around 5ft 6" tall, with long, dark hair.

Anyone with information is asked to call Cleveland Police on the non-emergency number 101.

Alternatively, people can visit https://mipp.police.uk/ and provide information direct to the investigation team.

Independent charity Crimestoppers is now offering a reward of up to Â£10,000 for information that leads to identifying the location of Naheed Khan's body. Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111 or online at: www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
