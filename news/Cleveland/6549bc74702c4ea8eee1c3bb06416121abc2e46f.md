A force-wide "sniffer dog" operation on Saturday night identified five people believed to be in possession of cocaine.

Licensing Unit officers, Operational Support and Special Constables visited two pubs in Redcar, three in Stockton, one in Middlesbrough and one in Hartlepool with drugs dog Barney.

Sgt Paul Higgins of Cleveland Police Licensing Unit said: "Saturday's operation was a great success and I'd like to thank the licensees for supporting our activity.

"We want people to enjoy safe, crime-free nights out and we will continue to work with partners to ensure that people are not consuming or dealing drugs in our pubs and clubs."
