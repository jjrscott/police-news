A Smallthorne man has been jailed for nine years and two months after pleading guilty to a robbery in Burslem.

Gareth Cristini, formerly of Baden Road, pleaded guilty to robbing a couple in Burslem, on 20 January.

The 41-year-old also pleaded guilty to possessing a knife in the same incident, where he took Â£220.

He also admitted a burglary in Biddulph Road, Fegg Hayes, on 8 December last year, where he took electrical items and money, and a VW Caddy without consent.

He also pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and driving without insurance and a licence.

Ds Andy Durber, of Staffordshire Police, said: "We're pleased that Cristini has been sentenced. These were distressing incidents for Cristini's victims."
