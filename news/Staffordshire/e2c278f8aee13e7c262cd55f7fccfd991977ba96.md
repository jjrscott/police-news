We are issuing an appeal for witnesses to an incident which resulted in two men being arrested in relation to an attempted robbery with a weapon that took place in Stoke yesterday (5 January) afternoon.

Officers attended Mobberley Road in Goldenhill, Stoke, at about 2.20pm to reports a woman had been approached by a man with a machete who demanded her mobile phone, but after she shouted "help" he ran off into a property.

An ambulance attended the scene.

Armed officers were deployed to search for the suspect. They searched a property on the street and two men - aged 33 and 38 - were arrested on suspicion of attempted robbery. They have both been released under investigation as enquiries continue.

Anyone with any information or who saw the incident should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 313 of 5 January, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
