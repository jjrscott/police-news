An experienced police investigator has been appointed as commander for the South Staffordshire area.

Chief Inspector Dave Wain started his career with Staffordshire Police in 2007, after graduating from De Montfort University with a degree in English literature.

He was promoted to sergeant in 2007 and was posted to South Staffordshire. His experience since includes investigative roles as a detective constable, detective sergeant, detective inspector and detective chief inspector. He has worked in CID, the Proactive team (designed to tackle and disrupt crime), Major Investigations Department (a team who have primacy for all murders and suspicious and unexplained deaths) and the Sex Offender Management Unit.

Most recently, Dave worked in the force's Anti-Corruption Unit for the last two years.

He replaces Acting Chief Inspector Simon O'Donnell, who is taking up a post at Police HQ.

Chief Inspector Dave Wain said: "I feel very proud to return to an area I worked in when I was a sergeant, to work with an excellent team of officers and staff who strive to make South Staffordshire a safe place to live and work.

"I will be engaging and working with partner organisations at a local level to tackle neighbourhood issues and listening to community concerns."

Dave enjoys playing rugby in his spare time. He has played for Stafford RUFC since 1997 and has represented Staffordshire. Dave is currently chairman of the force's rugby team, which supports a number of charities including Birmingham Children's Hospital. He also enjoys running and cycling.
