A man from Uttoxeter has been jailed after pleading guilty to inciting a female under the age of 13 to engage in sexual activity guilty and breaching the terms of his sexual harm prevention order.

Barry Thompson, 54, of Park Street, was sentenced at Stafford Crown Court on 8 December.

He was jailed for two years and eight months with an extended license for four years. He has also been disqualified from driving for 40 months.

Police were called on the afternoon of 29 August 2020 to a report of a man in a black BMW pulling over by a child in Burton and offering her money in exchange for a sexual act. A description of the vehicle was given to officers and Thompson was arrested later that day.

Detective Sergeant Hilary Boxer, from the force's Child Protection and Exploitation Team, said: "I would like to thank the young girl for having the courage to report this matter to the police.

"Thompson breached the conditions of his sexual harm prevention order.

"He is a registered sex offender and his risk is carefully managed by experienced offender managers. This is an example of the positive action we will take against offenders who fail to comply."
