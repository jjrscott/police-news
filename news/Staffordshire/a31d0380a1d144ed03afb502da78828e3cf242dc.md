We are aware of footage circulating on social media of arrests which took place in Cannock on Saturday (25 April).

There has inevitably been speculation about the incident, so we want to clarify what happened as it has already resulted in a completed court case.

Following a collision where a motorcyclist was injured we attended Redhill Road, Chadsmoor, at around 2.30pm, where groups had congregated.

Officers were keen to disperse the groups to ensure social distancing. A man called Sean Pearson was told to leave the area repeatedly but declined to do so and while being arrested elbowed a police officer.

Later, in custody, Pearson said he had Covid-19 and coughed in the face of another officer.

Pearson admitted both counts of assaulting an emergency worker and was yesterday (April 27) jailed for a total of 32 weeks - 26 weeks for coughing in the officer's face and six weeks for elbowing the first officer.

Another man, from the local area was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and driving under the influence of drugs. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

We will be examining the footage to see if further offences are disclosed.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 424 of 25 April, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
