Detectives are appealing for information following an attempted robbery at a post office in Burton this morning (28 February).

Just before 9am, a man entered Dean & Smedley Chemists on Horninglow Road, and threatened staff to open the till.

He fled the store, chased by a member of the public, in the direction of Hunter Street.

The suspect is described as white, 5ft 8ins - 5ft 10ins tall and medium build. He was wearing a grey zip up hoodie, black trousers and black trainers. He had a black and white scarf covering his mouth and carried an orange carrier bag.

Witnesses or anyone with information is asked to contact 101, quoting incident 121 of 28 February. Alternatively, for guaranteed anonymity, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111
