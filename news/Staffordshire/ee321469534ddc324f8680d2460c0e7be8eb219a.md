Nine vehicles, including three motorbikes, have been seized by officers as part of a recent road safety operation in Stoke-on-Trent.

The crackdown took place on 28 and 29 April following on-going concerns from local residents about the illegal use of off-road motorcycles and anti-social behaviour.

With support from the Roads Policing Unit, officers from Stoke South neighbourhood policing team targeted vehicles using roads and greenspace in Stoke, Blurton, Bentilee and Meir.

Using police off-road bikes, they also visited areas of private land where riders are known to gather, including Tickhill Quarry.

During the two days of action, officers carried out around 40 vehicle stops and seized six vehicles including three motorbikes. They also recovered items including suspected drugs and a lock knife and made four arrests which included;

A 19-year-old man, from Stoke-on-Trent, was arrested on suspicion of providing a positive drug swipe, dangerous driving, driving with no insurance and no licence.

A 19-year-old man, from Stoke-on-Trent, was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of a controlled drug.

A 48-year-old man, from Stoke-on-Trent, was arrested on suspicion of providing a positive drug swipe, theft and possession of an offensive weapon.

A 23-year-old man, from Stoke-on-Trent, was arrested on suspicion of possession of a Class B drug and failing to stop.

They were all released under investigation pending further enquiries.

A 23-year-old woman was also issued with a community resolution after being found with a small amount of suspected Class B drugs.

A roadworthiness prohibition (PG9) was issued for a defective tyre and advice was given to a further three motorists around minor vehicle defects.

PC Stuart Felthouse, who helped to co-ordinate the operation, said: "We will continue to run similar operations and target any drivers whose behaviour on the road presents a risk to other road users or themselves.

"We have listened to the concerns of local residents and hope that these days of action provided reassurance to the community that we take these matters very seriously."
