A man has been charged in connection with a stabbing in Great Wyrley last month.

Officers received a report of an injured man on Wardles Lane just after 11pm on 17 May.

A 21-year-old man suffered an arm and hand injury. He was taken to hospital in Birmingham where he was discharged a few days later.

Jamal Thompson, 19, of St Marks Road, Tipton, Sandwell, has been charged with attempt robbery, grievous bodily harm and possession of an offensive weapon.

He will next appear in court on 24 July.

A 30-year-old man from Birmingham and a 35-year-old woman from Walsall were also arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender and released under investigation pending further enquiries.
