Detectives carrying out an investigation into the death of a woman in Stoke-on-Trent are not treating it as suspicious.

The woman, in her 40s, was found at a property on Meere Close in Norton on 9 September.

A report is now being prepared for the Coroner. The family have asked for their right to privacy to allow them to grieve at this difficult time.
