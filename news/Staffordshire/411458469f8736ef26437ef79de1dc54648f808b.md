A man who broke into a secondary school and two shops in Tamworth has been jailed for one year and eight months.

Darryl McIntyre, 30, of Comberford Road, Tamworth, broke into Wilnecote High School on Tinkers Green Road and FP & S Parts and Browns Upholstery on Tame Valley Industrial Estate on 13 April last year.

McIntyre broke into the high school at around 1.30am by entering an enclosed courtyard, using a tool to smash the glass pane of a door and then used a crowbar to force a vending machine open to steal cash.

Between 2am and 3am, he then broke into FP & S Parts and took a cash tin containing Â£1800 and then broke into Browns Upholstery by jemmying a door and sprayed a fire extinguisher.

McIntyre was sentenced at Stafford Crown Court on Wednesday (22 January) after pleading guilty to two counts of burglary with intent to steal. He was found guilty of a further count of burglary with intent to steal.

Police Constable Sian Moran, from Tamworth Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "McIntyre targeted these premises and managed to make off but he was snared by DNA, CCTV and footwear prints.

"We will continue to target burglars who blight the communities in Tamworth and bring them to justice."
