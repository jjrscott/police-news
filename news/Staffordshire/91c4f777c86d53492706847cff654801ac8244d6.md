Police in the Staffordshire Moorlands are calling on caravan owners to be extra vigilant after a spate of incidents in the last week.

Over a 24 hour period we received four calls from concerned residents over two men seen acting suspiciously around caravans in Cheadle and Werrington.

One report suggests two men - seen driving a white Kia Sportage - tried to take a caravan off a driveway claiming they had thought it was for sale.

We're now urging caravan owners to ensure their property is locked correctly and secure, making sure they're also registered with the CHIS.

Deputy Commander for the Staffordshire Moorlands, Sergeant Rob Peacock said: "We understand there has been a lot of concern over reports in recent days and we are looking into each report.

"We ask that caravan owners are vigilant and get in touch if they have any information."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
