A man has been jailed for two years and ten months after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting a child.

Paul Norman Sankey, 65, of the Lichfield area, was sentenced on Monday (29 June) at Stafford Crown Court. A Sexual Harm Prevention Order has been imposed on Sankey for ten years. He will also be required to sign the Sex Offenders Register for life.

Detectives from CID South began an investigation after a 10-year-old girl was sexually assaulted in Penkridge in June 2018.

Detective Constable Laura Turner, from CID South, said: "This was a disturbing incident and Sankey's actions were terrifying for the young victim. I would like to praise her as she has shown a huge amount of courage throughout the investigation and court process."

"I hope the victim and her family can take some comfort from knowing he has now had to answer for his actions."
