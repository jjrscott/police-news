A 22-year-old man has been jailed for three years after he was caught by police officers while supplying heroin and cocaine in Rugeley.

Raseante Spencer-Hamilton was jailed at Stafford Crown Court (Jan 20) after pleading guilty to possession with intent to supply heroin and crack cocaine.

The court heard that Spencer-Hamilton was stopped in Wheelhouse Road in a white Vauxhall Corsa at about 11am on 3 December.

He was initially arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs after officers found a number of mobile phones and a quantity of cash in the vehicle.

Officers then found heroin and crack cocaine in a later search of his home address in Great Meadow Lane, Rugeley.

Spencer-Hamilton was subsequently charged and pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply heroin and crack cocaine, and possessing criminal property.

Detective Sergeant Jon Bradbury, of Staffordshire Police, said: "This was a good piece of work from the team that has resulted in a jail sentence for Spencer-Hamilton.

"He has connections right across the Midlands and we hope this sends out a message that we continue to bring those who think they can spread misery and debt through drug dealing before the courts."
