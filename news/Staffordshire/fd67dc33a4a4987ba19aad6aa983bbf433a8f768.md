Detectives are re-appealing for information after reports of a rape at a park in Stoke-on-Trent

Officers cordoned off a large area of Cobridge Park on Leek New Road over the weekend after we received a call reporting a serious sexual assault shortly after 9pm on Saturday 26 September.

A 16-year-old boy, from Stoke-on-Trent, has been arrested on suspicion of rape. He's been released conditional bail pending further enquiries.

Detective Inspector Scott McGrath, from CID North, says: "We're currently working hard to establish the circumstances around what happened that night and are really interested in speaking with anyone who might have vital information.

"We believe there was a number of people in the area at the time and we'd ask them to get in touch."

The victim's been offered support by specialist officers.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 779 of 26 September, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
