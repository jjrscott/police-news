A man who phoned in a bomb hoax to police has been given a 12-month suspended sentence.

Adnan Mehmood, 29, of Whitmore Street, Shelton, Stoke-on-Trent, was sentenced at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court today (Wednesday 23 September) after pleading guilty to communicating false information following a bomb hoax.

On 13 July this year, Mehmood called 999 claiming he had overheard a group of six men in Shelton saying they were going to plant bombs in Hanley town centre.

Following an extensive policing response, including searches and CCTV enquiries, the investigation proved that the defendant's account was false. When challenged he admitted that he had made up what he had reported and he was arrested.

He has also been given a 30-day Rehabilitation Activity Requirement, unpaid work requirement of 160 hours and costs of Â£340.

Detective Inspector Lucy Maskew, of CID North, said: "Mehmood's false report saw a large number of police and emergency services personnel involved, meaning they were taken away from attending other genuine calls.

"We hope this sends out a message that hoax threats and reports will absolutely not be tolerated and will be taken seriously by police and the courts."
