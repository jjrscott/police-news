The force's statement is below:

"Our sympathies remain with all of those affected by this tragic event.

"An independent investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) concluded that there were no indications that any officers had misconducted themselves. The evidence indicated that all the officers and police staff acted appropriately and in accordance with policy and procedure.

"At an inquest in March 2020, which examined the circumstances and evidence following the fatal road traffic collision in April 2018, the jury delivered a narrative verdict. In summary, they found that Joshua died as a result of a road traffic collision after driving contraflow along the A50. He made this decision in order to evade capture by the police."
