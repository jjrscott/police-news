A Staffordshire Police officer has been dismissed for gross misconduct - discreditable conduct -having admitted attempting to communicate sexually with a child and making indecent photographs/pseudo photographs of children.

Police Constable Lee Tatton, 54, pleaded guilty to attempting to engage in sexual communication with a child and four counts of making an indecent photograph/pseudo-photograph of a child at Birmingham Crown Court on 1 September.

Tatton, who was based in the force's Northern Resolution Centre, was arrested on 10 December 2019 by the force's Operation Safenet team and was immediately suspended.

A special case hearing, chaired by Chief Constable Gareth Morgan, held today (Monday 21 September), concluded that Tatton's actions amounted to gross misconduct and he was dismissed without notice. Tatton did not attend the hearing and was dismissed in his absence.

Chief Constable Gareth Morgan said: "Officers swear an oath to serve the people of Staffordshire with fairness, integrity, diligence and impartiality - and the overwhelming majority of officers and staff are loyal to that promise.

"Lee Tatton has fallen far short of the high standards expected by the public and the force and his discreditable conduct has led to his dismissal."

Tatton will be sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court on 2 November 2020.
