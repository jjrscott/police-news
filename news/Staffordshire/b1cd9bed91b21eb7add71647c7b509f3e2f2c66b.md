As Scams Awareness Month continues, we are warning how criminals are taking advantage of people with scams.

Victims are reporting receiving fake text messages from HMRC offering a 'rebate' and requesting card/bank details. Some of these messages, targeted at self-employed workers, contain a link that takes people to a convincing copy of the HMRC website where any data entered into the form there, is stolen.

Criminals are taking advantage of the NHS Test and Trace service by sending emails and texts containing links designed to obtain your banking information. Check web addresses carefully and do not click on any links. If possible, type the official addresses directly into browsers.

Students are being targeted in a fresh wave of cyber frauds bogus tax refunds. HMRC will never ask you to disclose personal or financial via email or text.

Fake emails are circulating asking for donations to the NHS. Avoid clicking on links or attachments as they could lead to fake websites used to capture your information. Always use official sites to donate to.

There are reports of fake emails advertising investments in Bitcoin platforms, supposedly endorsed by celebrities that claim to "take advantage of the financial downturn".

Don't click on the links or attachments in suspicious emails, and never response to messages that ask for your password or financial details, include requests to send images that provide your identity.

You can send your suspicious emails to report@phishing.gov.uk
