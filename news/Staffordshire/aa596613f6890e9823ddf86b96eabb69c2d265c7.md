A taxi driver from Stoke-on-Trent has been jailed for 21 weeks after he admitted carrying a weapon in his cab.

Azhar Hussain, aged 30, of Erskine Street, Dresden, was stopped by officers at 10pm on 30 August 2019 as he drove along Trentham Road.

He was the only occupant in the Toyota. Officers searched the car and found a knife with a four-inch blade in the glovebox.

Hussain was jailed at North Staffordshire Justice Centre on 23 January for possessing a bladed article.

Police constable Andrew Podolaka, of Staffordshire Police, said: ""Hussain being sent to prison for this offence sends out a clear message that carrying knives will not be tolerated, whether people believe it is for protection or otherwise."
