A man who tried to mask the smell of cannabis in his block of flats by spraying air freshener as a police officer approached him has been jailed.

Stafford Crown Court heard that Dougie Patterson was spraying air freshener in the communal area of his flats in Stafford Road, Stone, on 13 July when he was approached by an officer.

The smell of cannabis was strong and a search was conducted of Patterson's flat at around 7pm. Although nothing was found, officers searched another flat in the block and discovered a padlocked sports holdall.

The padlock keys were found on Patterson. Officers opened the bag and seized 38 freezer bags of cannabis weighing 1.16kg, £680 in cash and numerous deal bags.

The cannabis was later valued at around £10,600 for street deals.

Patterson, of Walton Grange, Stafford Road, Stone, was sentenced to 19 months for admitting possession with intent to supply cannabis.

He was sentenced on 7 October after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing.
