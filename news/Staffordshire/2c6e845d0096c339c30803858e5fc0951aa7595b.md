A man has been charged following the robbery of a taxi driver in August 2019.

Samuel Thomas Egerton, 23, of Grange Road, Cheddleton, has been charged with robbery and a racially aggravated Public Order Act offence.

On 4 August 2019, a taxi driver, on a journey between Dilhorne and Cheddleton, was robbed by a passenger who used threatening/abusive/insulting words or behaviour which was racially aggravated. A video of the incident was circulated on social media in January 2020.

Egerton is due to appear before magistrates at the North Staffordshire Justice Centre on 12 November.
