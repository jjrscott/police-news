An investigation is underway after a cannabis factory was uncovered in a house in Burton

Officers had been called to Hunter Street at around 1.05am this morning following reports of a suspicious incident in the neighbourhood.

On gaining entrance to a property, police found around 80 cannabis plants spread through the upstairs rooms.

Following the find, Western Power were contacted to make the property safe.

Now anyone with information is being asked to contact Staffordshire Police, as the investigation into this illegal operation continues.

Chief Inspector Clair Langley, Commander of East Staffordshire Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "These operations are dangerous and can pose a risk to neighbouring properties. I am pleased to see this illegal venture closed and this drugs cultivation activity prevented. I would urge anyone with concerns over drugs activity to contact us."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 0013 of January 20, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
