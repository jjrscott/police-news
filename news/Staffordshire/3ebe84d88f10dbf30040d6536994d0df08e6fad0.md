A 59-year-old man has been sentenced to six months imprisonment suspended for two years for a historical sexual offence committed against a young child in South Staffordshire.

Desmond Arthur Duckers, of Codsall, was sentenced at Stafford Crown Court on Friday (16 October) after pleading guilty to sexual activity with a child.

A Sexual Harm Prevention Order was made for five years and Duckers will be required to sign the Sex Offenders Register for seven years.

Detective Constable Toni Sunderland, of the force's Rape and Serious Sexual Offences Unit, said: "The victim has been brave in speaking out about this offence.

"This was a despicable offence committed against a child. We will always do whatever it takes to bring offenders to justice, while ensuring victims and their families are offered the support they need."

Anyone who has suffered sexual abuse, or suspects others may be subject to sexual abuse, is urged to contact Staffordshire Police.
