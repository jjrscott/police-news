A man who broke into a disabled woman's house and threatened her with an imitation firearm has been jailed for five years and seven months.

Shaun Brown, 31, of Victory Terrace, Fazeley, Tamworth and Luke Read, 19, of Caledonian, Tamworth, entered a home on St Ives Close in Tamworth on Saturday 29 June. The court heard that they kicked open the door with so much force that the wheelchair-bound woman was pushed backwards in her wheelchair.

Brown then held a fake gun to the woman's head whilst Read went into another room and ransacked a bedroom. Nothing was taken but a television was damaged.

The pair both pleaded guilty to possessing an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear/violence and were both sentenced on Stafford Crown Court today (26 November). Read was sentenced to 28 months.

Detective Sergeant Elise Mason, of force CID, said: "Though the vulnerable disabled woman wasn't hurt, she was left extremely shaken and frightened.

"Staffordshire Police will continue to target offenders who believe they can prey on houses across the county."
