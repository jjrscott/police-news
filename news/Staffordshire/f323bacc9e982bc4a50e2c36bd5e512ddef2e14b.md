A Black Country man has been jailed after admitting he attempted to obtain money while posing as a Covid contact tracer in Stafford.

Martin Payne, aged 30, of Bleakhouse Road, Oldbury, was sentenced to six weeks in prison after admitting six counts of making false representation to make gain for self or another or cause loss to others.

All six counts relate to incidents in the Castle Bank area of Stafford on 21 September.

The court heard Payne had worn a high-visibility bib as part of the deception. He told householders he was collecting on behalf of the NHS, but when challenged about identification he had walked away.

Payne was jailed by magistrates in Cannock (Nov 12). He was also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of Â£128.

Sergeant Nick Maingay, of Stafford Neighbourhood Policing Team, said "We're grateful to those householders who got in touch and, with the assistance of their accounts and evidence collected by CCTV and doorbell cameras, enabled us to bring this case to court.

"Payne was swiftly arrested and remanded in custody."
