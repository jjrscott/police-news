A closure order has been served on a property in Stone following problems with drugs, criminal damage and anti-social behaviour.

The closure order on the property in Kent Grove, off Mount Road, was granted by magistrates in Cannock today (Nov 26) under section 80 of the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 which prohibits people from remaining and returning to enter the property for a period of three months.

The property has been sealed off to the public and no further entry will be allowed for the remainder of the order.

Stafford Borough Neighbourhood Policing Team have attended numerous incidents connected with the property, including a man waving a Samurai sword at passing cars, Covid19 breaches, noise, suspected drug dealing and criminal damage including a TV being thrown through a window.

Due to this, the force recommended the full closure order be made, which has now been served.

Chief Inspector Giles Parsons, area commander for Stafford Borough Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "There have been numerous incidents connected to this property which have caused lots of problems for the local community with anti-social behaviour, links to crime and drugs.

"We have taken action to resolve these problems and we're keen to work with people in Stone to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour.

"We continue to work hard to tackle anti-social behaviour issues impacting on our community, and where addresses continually and repeatedly cause issues, we will consider taking similar action."
