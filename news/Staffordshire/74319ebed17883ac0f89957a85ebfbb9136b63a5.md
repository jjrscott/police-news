Detectives have launched an investigation after an attempted rape in Burton.

The incident reportedly happened at a property on Ashby Road at approximately 11.30pm last night (Tuesday 2 February).

The victim, a woman, is currently receiving support from specially-trained officers.

Now detectives are keen to hear from anyone who may have been in the Ashby Road area at around 11.30pm on Tuesday - along with motorists with dashcam footage who may have been travelling through at the time.

Detective Inspector Gemma Black, of the force's Rape and Serious Sexual Offences team, said: "At around 12.10am this morning, we received a report that a woman had been sexually assaulted in Burton.

"We have been carrying out a number of enquiries today to establish the full circumstances of the incident. However, we are still in the early stages of our investigation.

"I am particularly keen to speak to witnesses who were in the Ashby Street area of the town at approximately 11.50pm last night or have dashcam footage to contact police."

Anyone with any information, CCTV or dashcam footage should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 21 of 3 February, or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
