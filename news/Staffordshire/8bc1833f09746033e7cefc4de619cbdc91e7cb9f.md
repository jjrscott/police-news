Motorists treating a South Staffordshire road as a 'race track' have been warned they face having their vehicles taken off them.

Officers have received reports of cars gathering around the A460 Cannock Road in Featherstone where some have been spotted driving at high speeds and hurtling around the nearby roundabout off the M54.

Now warning notices have been installed in the area to inform anti-social drivers of Section 59 orders - which give the force the power to seize problematic vehicles.

PC Preeti Patel, of South Staffordshire Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We have received complaints from residents on this matter as these motorists are causing a nuisance in the locality.

"The manner of driving reported to us is not just anti-social but dangerous and they are putting their lives at risk by using the cars in the way they are. It is simply unacceptable to treat this area as a race track.

"Our local officers have been to the area and signs warning these drivers of the Section 59 legislation have been installed. This legislation does give us the power to seize vehicles which are being used in an anti-social way.

"The Central Motorway Police Group along with the force's Road Policing Unit have also been made aware.

"We are asking for anyone with dash cam footage of vehicles causing problems in the area to get in contact with the police."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter, or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
