Officers are continuing to investigate a fatal road traffic collision which took place in Penkridge on Monday 30 September.

The incident happened just after 8.05pm on the A449 Stafford Road and involved a pedestrian and a dark-coloured Vauxhall van being driven by a man in his fifties.

27-year-old Adrian Leighton, from the Stafford area, sadly died at the scene. His family are being supported by specially-trained officers and have asked for their privacy to be respected at this difficult time.

Police have carried out a number of enquiries, and are asking anyone who saw Mr Leighton prior to the collision to get in touch.

It is believed that he was involved in an altercation outside of the White Hart Public House, on Stone Cross, Penkridge, at around 7.40pm on Monday evening (30 September).

A 43-year-old man from Penkridge, was arrested on Wednesday (2 October) on suspicion of common assault. He has since been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Although this incident is not believed to be connected to the road traffic collision, detectives are keen to understand exactly what happened that evening.

We are asking any witnesses to the altercation outside the White Hart Public House or the collision, to get in touch by calling 101, or sending a private message to Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter, quoting incident number 709 of 30 September.
