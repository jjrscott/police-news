Officers are appealing for witnesses after a woman sadly died in a road traffic collision yesterday (2 December).

The collision, involving a Vauxhall Mokka and a Kia Picanto, happened on Ashby Road in Burton-on-Trent at around 12.15pm.

Colleagues from West Midlands Ambulance Service and Midlands Air Ambulance attended but sadly nothing could be done to save the woman in her 70s and she was pronounced dead at the scene.

Specialist officers are supporting the woman's family at this difficult time.

A man in his 70s was taken to hospital by ambulance with head injuries.

An investigation is underway by officers from the Staffordshire and West Midlands Serious Collision Investigation unit and anyone with information is asked to get in touch.

Any witnesses or anyone with dash-cam footage are asked to call 101 quoting incident number 241 of 2 December or email ciu@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk.

Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
