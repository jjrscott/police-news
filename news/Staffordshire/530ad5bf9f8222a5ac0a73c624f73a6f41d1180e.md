Police have shut down a house which became a magnet for anti-social behaviour and drug misuse.

And senior officers have warned they will continue to pursue action over problematic properties after landing the Closure Order for the address on Biddulph's St John's Road.

Officers with Moorlands Neighbourhood Policing Team were granted the order - which means the house cannot be used for three months - by magistrates at North Staffordshire Justice Centre on December 18.

Sergeant Rob Peacock, deputy commander at Moorlands NPT, said: "We have previously seen issues around anti-social behaviour, drug misuse and public disorder at this property.

"We have worked closely with Your Housing - who own the property - to resolve issues with the previous tenant. However the tenant did not engage and continued to allow serious anti-social behaviour to take place at the address."

Chief Inspector Mark Thorley, commander of Moorlands NPT, says seeking a Closure Order is not a decision taken lightly. He said: "This represents the force taking a stance against those whose actions have impacted heavily on the surrounding community.

"We do not take this action lightly, but we do place the needs of the community over the issues caused by a few who do not heed our advice and support.

"We will continue to work with our partners to take action over properties which are causing problems in our neighbourhoods."
