A teenager has pleaded guilty to weapons and drugs offences and will be sentenced later this month.

The 16-year-old male, from the Walsall area, was arrested after Staffordshire Police attended a report of a robbery in Hednesford on Tuesday (5 January).

At about 4.20pm officers attended the report of a robbery on Station Road.

Two teenage boys had been walking along the road when they were approached by two others, who had tried to rob one of them. But the boys fled. The two would-be robbers then approached another group before leaving.

The 16-year-old male was later charged with possession of a bladed article in a public place and possession of cannabis. He pleaded guilty to both charges at North Staffordshire Justice Centre today.

Sergeant Mark Burslem of Staffordshire Police's Cannock neighbourhood team, said: "We would like to reassure people that at no point were the wider public in any danger and officers will continue to patrol the area to offer the community reassurance."

The teenager has been referred to the Black Country Youth Court for sentencing on 27 January.
