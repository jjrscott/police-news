Two brothers have been jailed for a total of 16 years after pleading guilty to an aggravated burglary in Leek.

Grant Morse, aged 31, of West Parade, Fenton, pleaded guilty to aggravated burglary in Ball Haye Road, on 20 September.

Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard yesterday (Feb 25) he had entered a property as a trespasser to steal bank cards and Â£250 cash, while carrying a machete.
He was jailed for nine years.

Grant's younger brother, Ryan Morse, aged 24, of Haregate Road, Leek, pleaded to aggravated burglary with intent. He also entered the property as a trespasser with intent to steal, while in possession of a machete.

He was sentenced to seven years.

Detective Sergeant Andy Durber, of Staffordshire Police, said: "We are glad the Morse brothers have been jailed and the sentences reflect the seriousness of these offences.

"They went into a private property with the clear intention to steal and in possession of dangerous weapons."
