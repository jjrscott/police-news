A warrant at an address in Hanley has led to four people being arrested in relation to drug offences.

Police carried out the warrant yesterday (Tuesday, 14 January), at a property near to Joiners Square and arrested two men.

Eighteen year-old Thomas Podmore of Stuart Road, was charged with two counts of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs-Cocaine and Heroin. Richard Eveson, aged 42, also of Stuart Road, was arrested and charged with intention to pervert the course of justice. Both were due to appear before North Staffordshire Justice Centre today (Wednesday).

Two women were also arrested at the address, a 38-year-old on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs and a 20-year-old who was taken into custody on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs. Both women have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
