Officers are appealing for witnesses to a shop robbery that took place in Stoke-on-Trent on Thursday (11 March).

They are particularly keen to speak to two members of the public who tried to enter the Prime Express Store on Chaplin Road, Normacot, as the robbery unfolded at about 5.35pm.

Two men with masks on entered the shop at around this time and punched a member of staff, also threatening them with a knife. They took a large amount of cash from the store and left, running along Buccleuch Road and down an alleyway that leads to Hamilton Road.

It has also been reported there were others stood at the door of the store while the incident occurred.

If you are one of the two members of the public who tried to enter the store during this time, or saw or witnessed anything suspicious in the area at the time, message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 604 of 11 March, or alternatively contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
