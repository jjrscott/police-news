A puppy who was stolen from an animal shelter in Stoke-on-Trent this week has been recovered safely.

The three months-old Jack Russell female puppy was found to be missing from her locked kennel on Monday morning in Ash Bank when staff came into work. She is believed to have been taken overnight. Officers tracked her to an address in Bucknall and have now taken her to a safe place while she waits to be re-homed.

Cheadle Neighbourhood Officer, PC Mark Garsden, who found the puppy said: "

"The animal shelter let us name the puppy Tommo, after a recently retired bobby, We then found out the puppy was female, so she remains un-named."

Officers continue to investigate the theft and anyone with information can direct message us on Twitter or Facebook quoting incident 208 of 8 October or ring 101.
