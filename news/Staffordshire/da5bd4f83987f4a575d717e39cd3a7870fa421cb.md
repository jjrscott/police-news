A 42-year-old man has been arrested in Sweden on suspicion of the murder of a woman in Stoke on-Trent.

The man, who is from the Sneyd Green area of the city, was arrested by Swedish police in connection with the death of 71-year-old Wendy Morse in Knypersley.

Detective Inspector Cheryl Hannan, of Staffordshire Police, said the force was working closely with officers in Sweden to secure the man's extradition.
