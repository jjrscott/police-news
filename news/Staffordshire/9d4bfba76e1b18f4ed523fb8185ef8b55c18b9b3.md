An investigation is underway after two Land Rovers were stolen from Kinver this week.

The first incident saw a Land Rover Discovery taken overnight from outside a property on Compton Road between March 15 and the following day.

That vehicle was later discovered in Lower Gornal in Dudley and is now undergoing a forensic examination.

A further Discovery was stolen from Foster Street, also in Kinver, at some point between 7.30pm on March 16 and 6am the following day.

Now enquiries are ongoing as officers look to establish whether the incidents are linked.

PC Duncan Lampitt said: "We have to be open-minded over these thefts possibly being carried out by the same individuals due to the nature of the vehicles being targeted and being in the same area of South Staffordshire.

"We are carrying out the necessary forensic examination on the Land Rover which has been recovered along with checking CCTV from both locations. We would urge residents to be vigilant over any suspicious activity in the area especially around vehicles."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 076 of March 17, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
