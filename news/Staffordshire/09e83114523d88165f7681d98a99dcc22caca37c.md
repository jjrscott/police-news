Two men have been arrested on suspicion of being equipped for the theft of a motor vehicle while travelling through Burton-on-Trent.

On Sunday (31 January), a white Ford Focus activated an ANPR camera that was wanted in connection with another offence.

Officers followed the vehicle and, after it came to a stop in Efflinch Lane, Barton-under-Needwood, two men - both aged 39 and from Birmingham - were detained for a stop and search.

They had numerous items in their possession including a fresh set of number plates for a Vauxhall Mokka and a new Vauxhall car key. The driver also had no driver's license and wasn't insured to drive the Focus. A sat nav in the vehicle was set up to travel to Uttoxeter.

Both were arrested on suspicion of being equipped for the theft of the motor vehicle, while the driver will be summonsed to face the documentation offences. Both men have been released under investigation as enquiries continue.
