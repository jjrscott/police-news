Detectives are continuing their investigations to understand the circumstances around a man's death.

Police were called to a suspicious incident in Crossfell, Tamworth, shortly before 5.30am on Tuesday morning (January 19).

A 31-year-old man was taken to hospital but was sadly pronounced dead a short time later. His family have since been informed.

Detectives say the man was found by officers not wearing a top and are urging anyone who may have seen him in the area prior to emergency services being called to call the force. It is believed he may have been walking around the Crossfell and Eringden areas before being found.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 0062 of January 19, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
