A dog walker was injured in an assault in Audley on Tuesday (11 August) and we're appealing for witnesses to assist with our investigation.

A man in his 50s was attacked as he walked his pet dog - a white Bichon Frise - along Wereton Road near the junction of Dean View.

Sometime between 9pm - 9.30pm, a man approached the victim and asked for directions, as a woman accomplice tried to unhook the dog's harness and lead. The victim grabbed his dog before being assaulted by the pair. He suffered a serious injury to his face which required hospital treatment.

The man is described as Eastern European, around 30-years-old, medium build and spoke with a Polish accent. He had dark hair which was long on top and short on the sides. He wore a navy top with jeans and white trainers.

The woman is also described as Eastern European, around 30-years-old, slim build and spoke with a Polish accent. She had long dark hair and wore a light coloured vest top with a skirt or shorts and sparkly sandals.

The suspects travelled to and from the scene in a silver people carrier, which is described as rundown with a sliding side door.

Officers investigating the incident believe the offenders' intention was to take the dog and they are appealing for anyone who saw any suspicious behaviour in the area or a vehicle matching the description to come forward.

Any witnesses or anyone with any information can call 101, or report online quoting incident number 795 of 11 August. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
