A group of men with a weapon targeted an address in Tamworth on Tuesday afternoon (3 November).

Detectives are appealing for information following the incident, where three masked offenders, armed with a machete, tried to force their way inside of a property on Balfour.

They smashed the windscreen of a vehicle parked on the drive before fleeing towards Lichfield Street in a black SUV-type vehicle at around 2.30pm.

Armed police officers attended and carried out extensive searches of the surrounding area but were unable to locate them.

Detective Constable Howard Davies, from CID, said: "Two people were inside the property at the time of the attack. They were incredibly brave and held the front door shut to prevent the offenders gaining entry.

"We would like to reassure local residents that incidents of this nature in the Tamworth area are rare and a thorough investigation is underway.

"We are appealing for anyone who witnessed any suspicious behaviour in Balfour and the surrounding streets, or may have caught the men on CCTV or dash-cam to get in touch."

Any witnesses or anyone with any information is asked to contact 101, quoting incident number 410 of 3 November, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
