Detectives are investigating following an attempted robbery in Biddulph.

At around 10pm last night (Tuesday 10 March) a 33-year-old man was driving along Brown Lees Road, when he saw a dark-coloured vehicle which appeared to be broken down near to the junction of Stadmorslow Lane.

Two men gestured at him to pull over and as he got out of his vehicle they asked for his car keys. When he refused, one of the men has stabbed the driver with a knife causing a minor injury.

Enquiries are on-going and we are appealing for anyone in the area who saw anything suspicious last night, or anyone with dash-cam footage from Brown Lees Road to come forward and speak to officers.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 872 of 10 March, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
