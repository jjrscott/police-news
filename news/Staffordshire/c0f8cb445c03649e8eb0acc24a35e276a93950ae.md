A man who attacked a staff member with a wheel brace at a takeaway has been jailed for four and a half years.

Dominic Chaplin, 28, of Foley Street, Stoke-on-Trent, demanded money from a staff member at Lin Chinese takeaway on King Street in Fenton on Friday 27 September at around 11.50pm.

Chaplin entered the Chinese and verbally abused the worker, demanding money. The worker handed Chaplin Â£40 of his own money before Chaplin followed him into the kitchen, pushed him against the wall and struck him over the head before making off. Officers arrested him a short time later.

The member of staff suffered head injuries and was given glue treatment for open wounds.

Chaplin pleaded guilty to attempted robbery at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court at an earlier hearing. He also pleaded guilty to possession of Class B drugs after officers searched his home address and recovered cannabis, and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place.

Detective Constable Michael George, from CID, said: "This was an unprovoked attack on a member of staff who was due to close the takeaway shortly.

"The victim was simply at his place of work doing his job but ended up walking away from work shaken and left with nasty head injuries."
