A man who repeatedly phoned his victim as she was reporting she had been raped to police, has been sentenced to 15 years.

Grant Mountford, 28, was jailed for 11 years, with a further four years to serve on an extended licence, at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court yesterday (Feb 3).

Mountford, of Victoria Avenue, Bignall End, was found guilty of rape, assault by beating and assault occasioning actual bodily harm following an attack at an address in Stoke-on-Trent on June 18.

Later on that day Mountford was spotted on a bridge over the A500 near Alsager after officers were sent to deal with a man considering harming himself. Mountford was persuaded down and arrested for rape.

Detective Inspector Zoe Kelsall, of Staffordshire Police, said: "The bravery of the witness in coming forward and giving evidence is to be commended. This was a despicable offence involving threat and physical harm and we welcome Mountford's lengthy prison term.

"We will always do whatever it takes to bring offenders to justice, while ensuring victims and their families are offered the support they need."

Anyone who has suffered sexual abuse, or suspects others may be subject to sexual abuse, is urged to contact Staffordshire Police on 101.
