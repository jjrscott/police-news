Two men have been arrested after drugs and a lock knife were found at an address in Uttoxeter following an intelligence-led operation yesterday (12 September).

Officers searched a home on Park Avenue at around 9am and found drugs believed to be cannabis and heroin, a lock knife, scales and mobile phones.

The pair were arrested yesterday as part of the on-going Operation Disrupt, which aims to crack down on criminal activity across Staffordshire.

A 20-year-old man from Derby was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in drugs, possession of an offensive weapon and possession of a controlled drug.

A 39-year-old man from Uttoxeter was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply. They remain in custody.

Chief Inspector Jason Nadin, commander for East Staffordshire, said: "This intelligence-led operation was carried out as part of a proactive policing investigation to tackle criminals who are causing the most harm to communities across Staffordshire.

"We will continue to disrupt crime in the area and I would ask anyone concerned about drugs or anyone with information to call 101."
