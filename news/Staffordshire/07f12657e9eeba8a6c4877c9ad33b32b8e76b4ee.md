Detectives are appealing for anyone with information to come forward after a man was seriously assaulted in Newcastle-under-Lyme.

A 40-year-old was attacked in the car park of Apedale Community Country Park on Blackbank Road between 4am and 4.15am on Friday (5 June) as he walked to work.

He was approached by two men who assaulted him, causing serious facial injuries, which later required surgery.

The first suspect is described as Asian, late teens, approximately 5ft 10ins tall, slim build with a moustache. The second man is described as black and believed to be 18 or 19 years old. They both wore dark clothing.

An investigation is underway and anyone with information or anyone who may have seen a black VW Golf in the area at the time is asked to call 101 quoting incident number 058 of 5 June.

Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
