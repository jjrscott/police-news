Officers have issued a safety warning after a vehicle with commercial fireworks inside was stolen from Codsall.

A grey Fiat Fullback containing up to 200 fireworks was stolen from Strawmoor Lane at around midday (25 October).

The industrial fireworks, which are so powerful they shouldn't be lit directly by a person, could cause serious injuries or kill. They are described as light brown and egg-shaped, ranging between six to 20 inches in diameter. They are individually wrapped in clear plastic bags.

Witnesses or anyone with any information are encouraged to call Staffordshire Police on 101, or 999 in an emergency, quoting incident number 273 of 25 October.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
