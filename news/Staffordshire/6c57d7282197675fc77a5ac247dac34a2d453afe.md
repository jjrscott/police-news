Two burglars who smashed their way into a shop in Leek using a crowbar have been sentenced at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court.

The court heard that Damien Carter, aged 37, and Dean Eastlake, aged 30, forced their way into ABC Phone, Tablet and Laptop Repairs just after midnight on 27 January.

Carter tried to force the door with the crowbar and then smashed a window before being disturbed. Carter dumped the crowbar in a grit bin before both ran off.

Carter, of no fixed address, who had previously burgled a property in Sandon Street, Leek, admitted two offences of burglary and an attempted burglary.

Eastlake, of Mill Street, Leek, admitted burglary and attempted burglary.

Carter was jailed for 876 days for burglary and a further 12 months for a second burglary, with 10 months concurrent sentence for attempted burglary.

Eastlake received a 20-month sentence suspended for 18 months.

Sergeant Rob Peacock, of Staffordshire Police, said: "We're glad Carter and Eastlake have been sentenced and that Carter has been jailed for these burglaries.

"Local knowledge led to them being identified from CCTV by officers."

Both were sentenced on 21 February.
