Officers from Staffordshire Police have released CCTV images of two boys they would like to speak to in connection with a robbery in Cannock.

At around 2.30pm on Friday 3 January, a 12-year-old boy was followed by two boys from the underpass near Morrisons, onto the multi-story car park of the Prince of Wales Centre.

He was threatened with violence, before they made off with his bike in the direction of Cannock railway station.

The bike is described as a black Medusa with multi-coloured wheels. It is valued at Â£420 and was received as a Christmas present just days earlier.

Anyone who recognises the boys captured in CCTV or has any information that may assist with the investigation is asked to email Darren.Wilkes@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk, quoting incident number 535 of 3 January.
