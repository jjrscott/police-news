We're appealing for witnesses after a motorcyclist was killed in a fatal road traffic collision near Loggerheads last night.

Officers were called to the A53 Newcastle Road at Oakley Folly, between Loggerheads and Blore Heath at around 7:30pm on Wednesday 4 November to several reports of a red Kawasaki motorcycle colliding with a red case IH tractor towing a green trailer.

A blue Ford Kuga was also involved.

Despite the best efforts of passing motorists and colleagues at West Midlands Ambulance Service, a 21-year-old man from Newcastle-under-Lyme was confirmed dead at the scene. His family are being supported by specially trained officers.

Sergeant Richard Moors from the Staffordshire and West Midlands Collision Investigation Unit said: "This is a devastating collision where a young man has sadly lost his life.

"We are now asking for anyone with any information, or who may have witnessed what happened, to get in touch and help with our enquiries."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 639 of 4 November, call 101, alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or email CIU@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk.
