Officers are asking residents to note down details of off-road bikes causing problems in their neighbourhood after concerns were raised over the vehicles being used in an anti-social manner.

Stoke-on-Trent North Neighbourhood Policing Team has received complaints over the bikes being used around Norton Heights and the nearby Ford Green Nature Reserve.

Local PCSO Emily Clamp said: "It has come to our attention that as the weather is improving and there are lighter evenings, that people are taking the opportunity to use off-road bikes.

"This has caused considerable annoyance to the residents in these areas and for the members of the public who are out for a walk.

"We would ask anyone who sees any off-road bike being used in an anti-social manner to make a note of the registration plate or even the make, model or colour and to then pass those details to us."

In addition, PCSO Clamp is investigating reports of individuals trying door handles of vehicles and properties on Norton Heights.

She said: "We would ask anyone with CCTV footage to contact the force.We are aware of these issues and are regularly patrolling the area. I would remind residents to make sure they keep their vehicles secured with any valuables out of sight."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
