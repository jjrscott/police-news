Officers from the Staffordshire and West Midlands Serious Collision Investigation Unit are appealing for witnesses following a fatal road traffic collision in Meir this morning (3 November).

Emergency services were called to Sandon Road near the junction with Martindale Close at 4.05am following reports that a van had collided with a wall.

Sadly, a man was pronounced dead at the scene. A second man was taken to hospital with serious injuries.

The road is currently closed and expected to be so for several hours as an investigation is underway.

Anyone who witnessed the collision or has relevant dashcam or CCTV footage is asked to contact 101 quoting incident number 063 of 03 November or alternatively email the team direct at CIU@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk

Officers would like to thank local residents and Ormiston Meridian Academy for their patience and co-operation this morning.
