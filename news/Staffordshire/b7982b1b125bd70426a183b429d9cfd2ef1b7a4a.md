Almost 300 motorists \- including some travelling at double the speed limit - have been caught speeding during a crackdown by motorway officers.

Central Motorway Police Group launched a month-long speeding operation on 8 May on the M6 and A500 in Staffordshire and have recorded 279 speeders.

Those speeding were above the limit where a driver would qualify for a speed awareness course and were caught by officers patrolling the motorway and roadside cameras.

A total of 279 motorists caught were given either three points and a fine or reported for summons. Five vehicles were also stopped and seized for having no insurance.

The highest speed recorded at 141mph on the M6 Toll and another motorist driving at 140mph on the M6 between junction 12 and 13.

A number of drivers were also stopped by officers and dealt with after being caught driving at 90mph in 50mph limit zones on the A500 and another driver was stopped for driving at 95mph in a 30mph zone in Etruria Vale Road in Stoke-on-Trent.

Inspector Sion Hathaway, from Central Motorway Police Group, said: "Just a few extra miles per hour can make all the difference to a driver's reaction, braking distances and ultimately put other lives at risk.

"Though a total of 279 drivers caught speeding may be a worrying figure - those are 279 incidents that could have ended up in a devastating result.

"We hope those caught will think twice about putting both themselves and other motorists in danger and we'll carry on taking action on those that continue to speed."
