A teenager is facing a series of drugs charges after being stopped on his moped in Tamworth and being found in possession of illegal substances.

Aaron Torley, aged 18, from Milton Avenue, Leyfields, Tamworth, is facing one count of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs (cocaine), four counts of possession with intent to supply a Class B drug (cannabis) and two counts of acquiring, using or possessing criminal property.

He was spotted at about 3.55pm on Tuesday (12 January) on his moped acting suspiciously on a car park off Masefield Drive in Leyfields.

Officers saw the moped again at about 5pm waiting at traffic lights on Salters Lane. Torley was stopped and searched and was found to have a mobile phone and a quantity of cannabis.

A subsequent search of his home address uncovered more cannabis, cocaine, scales and a large quantity of cash.

Torley appeared before magistrates in Newcastle-under-Lyme yesterday (14 January) where he was remanded in custody for a further hearing on a date yet to be confirmed.

In a separate incident, a blue VW Caddy van was stopped at about 4.25pm on Tuesday (12 January) on Masefield Drive and the driver - a 35-year-old male from Tamworth - was arrested on a warrant for failing to surrender to police / court bail at an appointed time.
