Police are appealing for help to trace four men who targeted an address on Speechley Drive, Rugeley, last night (12 September).

The masked offenders, armed with a firearm and a baton, forced their way into the property at around 10.15pm.

They threatened and assaulted the occupants, who sustained minor injuries, and were left understandably shaken by the incident.

Officers attended and carried out extensive searches of the surrounding area with enquiries continuing this afternoon.

Chief Inspector Sarah Wainwright, commander for the Cannock Chase Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "Fortunately, incidents of this nature are very rare in this area and a thorough investigation is underway.

"We have increased police patrols in the neighbourhood to offer reassurance to local residents and address any concerns.

"Detectives are currently treating this as an isolated incident and there is not believed to be any threat to the wider community."

Any witnesses or anyone with any information is asked to contact 101, quoting incident number 795 of 12 September, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
