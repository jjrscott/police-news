Youngsters across Newcastle are being invited to showcase their creative talents and come up with some police-theme pieces of art - and win a visit from one of the force's dogs.

Officers with Newcastle Neighbourhood Policing Team have laid down the challenge where the winning child will receive a voucher while a police dog will also pop in to their school.

Neighbourhood officer PC Natasha Egar said: "Children are now back in school after what has been a tough few months for them. Due to the lockdown we haven't been able to go out to our schools as much as we have done previously and by doing a contest like this it's a nice chance for us to continue engaging."

PC Egar wants children from Newcastle's primary schools to come up with some police-theme artwork with participants able to do a drawing or use some materials to build something. She said: "They might be inspired by a police car, a station, or an officer. We will accept drawings and it would also be great if they could make something out of the things they have at home."

The neighbourhood team has linked up with the force's dog handlers where one of the dogs will make a special visit to the winning child's school. PC Egar has also won the support of one of Newcastle's branches of Morrisons, who have kindly donated the other prizes - including a £15 voucher.

In addition to a visit from one of the dogs, the winning youngster will receive a £15 Kids' Choice voucher and an activity book. Second prize is a paint book, play dough, and confectionery while the youngster in third will receive some art materials including crayons, paints, glitter and paint brushes.

A photograph of the piece of art should be e-mailed to newcastlenpt@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk no later than April 3. Those taking part should include the full name of the child and their school. The competition is only open to children attending primary schools in Newcastle
