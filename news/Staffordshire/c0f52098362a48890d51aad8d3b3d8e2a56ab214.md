A man has this week been jailed following a stabbing in Lichfield in May.

19-year-old Nathan Michaels, of Badgers Bank Road in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands was sentenced to 36 months at Stafford Crown Court on Tuesday 6 October having pleaded guilty to a charge of assault causing grievous bodily harm.

It's after officers were called to reports a man had been seriously injured following an attack at a property in Reynolds Close, Lichfield shortly before 11:30pm on Saturday 2 May.

Sergeant Tony La Planche said: "Carrying and using a knife can have fatal consequences and Michaels showed no compassion for his victim - leaving him lying on the flood, seriously injured and needing hospitalisation.

"We will always seek to prevent and prosecute these offences to keep the public safe and bring offenders to justice."
