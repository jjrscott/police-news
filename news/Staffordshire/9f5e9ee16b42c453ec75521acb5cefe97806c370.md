Officers are appealing for information after a cafe was burgled in Fenton.

CCTV footage shows two masked men entering the Hilltop Community Cafe in Fenpark at about 11pm on Thursday (15 October).

Alcohol, a HiFi system, DVDs, console games as well as a quantity of pies and sausage rolls were stolen.

Most of the stolen items were previously gifted to the cafe, which is run by volunteers.

Officers believe the offenders may be local to the area and urge anyone who has been offered these items for sale in the last two days to get in touch.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 128 of 16 October, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
