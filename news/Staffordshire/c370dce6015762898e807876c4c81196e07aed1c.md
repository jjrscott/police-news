We are appealing for information about an assault that took place at the McDonald's drive-thru on Watling Street, Tamworth, on Saturday (21 November) evening.

We received a call at about 5.55pm after reports a man had been punched in the face while queuing to use the drive-thru ordering service.

The attacker - a male described as in his 40s, 5ft 11" in height and of a large build, wearing jeans and a jacket and driving a Land Rover Discovery - claimed the victim had jumped the queue. He reportedly approached the victim before punching then in the face.

Both the victim and the attacker then made their orders when it was their turn and left the scene.
Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 532 of 21 November, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
