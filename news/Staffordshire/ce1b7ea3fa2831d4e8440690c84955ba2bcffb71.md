Detectives are appealing for witnesses to a break-in where a cash till and cigarettes were stolen by men brandishing a sledgehammer.

The incident took place at around 1.15am on Saturday (Nov 30). Three men broke into the Co-op store in Brownhills Road, Norton Canes, near Cannock.

A cash till containing a large quantity of cash and vape cigarettes were taken after a counter was smashed with the hammer.

The men are believed to have made their escape in a dark-coloured car driven by a fourth man.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101, direct message us on Facebook or Twitter or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident number 58 of 30 November.
