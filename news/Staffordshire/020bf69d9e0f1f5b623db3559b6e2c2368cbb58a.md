A man who burgled two houses in Cannock and attempted to burgle two more has been jailed for four years eight months.

Don Milligan, 36, pleaded guilty to a total of eight charges when he was sentenced at Stafford Crown Court yesterday (July 7).

The court heard that the offences all took place on Saturday 29 February and the following day.

Milligan, of Edward Street, admitted burglary with intent to steal in Linden View and Stagborough Way, Cannock, on 1 March.

He also pleaded guilty to attempted burglaries in Lower Road and Herondale on the same date. Milligan also admitted assault by beating and causing around £1,000 worth of damage to a Citroen car, as well as damaging furniture and fittings in a house in Cannock on February 29.

Finally, he pleaded guilty to stealing £40 cash from a meter.

PC Daniel Trupp, of Cannock Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "These were a series of burglaries and attempted breaks which took place in a very short space of time.

"Milligan also destroyed property and committed an assault so we're glad that following a swift arrest and charge he has now been sentenced for his crimes."

Milligan was charged the day after the offences (March 2).
