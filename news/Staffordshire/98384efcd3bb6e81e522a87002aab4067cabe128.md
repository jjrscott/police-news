The first group of detectives from a national programme that aims to recruit a diverse group of people have joined Staffordshire Police.

A total of nine trainee detectives are from a variety of different backgrounds as part of Police Now's ambition to create a more diverse and different culture in a range of roles within policing.

The trainee detectives include a university lecturer, a Prince's Trust programme manager, a prison officer, a mountaineering instructor, a social worker and a number of other professions. They are the first group to join the force from the national scheme.

Police Now aims to recruit trainee detectives from different backgrounds to bring a variety of people-related skills, life experiences and perspectives to the job.

The trainees, who officially joined this week, will undergo an intensive 13-week police academy course where they will experience a variety of different departments.

Detective Chief Inspector Steven Smith, force lead for Police Now, said: "The Police Now Detective scheme is an exciting opportunity for anyone interested in a career in investigations.

"I'm excited to see the trainees progress over the next two years."
