Updated News Post

Officers from Staffordshire Police have called off the search for missing person Janetta Tatler, who was last seen in Hanford, Stoke-on-Trent, at 6.30pm on Thursday 14 January.

Sadly, the body of a woman, believed to be 65-year-old Janetta, was found in an area off Bainbridge Road in Trentham, this afternoon (16 January).

Formal identification will take place in due course. Janetta's family have been informed and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.

Detectives do not believe there are any suspicious circumstances and a report will be prepared for HM Coroner.
