Two Birmingham men jailed last year for conspiring to steal high performance cars have pleaded guilty to a further offence in Lichfield.

Kieron Donovan, 32, of Castle Bromwich, Birmingham was found guilty by a jury at Stafford Crown Court on 31 July 2018 of conspiracy to steal, conspiracy to commit burglary and using a vehicle without insurance.

Dean Millard, 49, of Hodge Hill, Birmingham pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal, conspiracy to commit burglary and using a vehicle without insurance at an earlier hearing.

Donovan was sentenced to eight years three months at Stafford Crown Court on 3 August 2018, while Millard received six years two months.

In a hearing on 27 September at Stafford Crown Court Donovan and Millard admitted a further burglary in Lichfield, including one where a BMW was stolen from St Michael's Road, Lichfield, on 25 August 2017.

Donovan and Millard were sentenced to a further two years each to be served concurrently.

Detective Constable Damon Millar, of the Regional and Organised Crime Unit for the West Midlands, said: "Donovan and Millard were part of a group of four men who caused great distress, with the potential for more thefts if they were not caught."

"We are glad they are serving significant sentences and that these other matters in Lichfield have now been taken into account."
