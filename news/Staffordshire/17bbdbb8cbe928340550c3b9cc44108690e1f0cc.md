A Black Country man has been charged with six counts of attempting to obtain money while posing as a Covid contact tracer.

Martin Payne, aged 30, of Oldbury, is charged with six counts of dishonestly purporting to be a Covid contact tracer intending to obtain money.

Four charges relate to Highfields, Stafford, on 21 September, with further charges in Castle Bank and Western Downs, Stafford, on the same date.

Payne appeared before magistrates in Newcastle this morning and has been bailed to appear again at Cannock on 24 November.
