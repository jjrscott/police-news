A man who bit his victim's nose during an assault in a north Staffordshire pub has been sentenced.

Thirty-year-old Michael Vaughan was convicted on 5 March at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court after jurors heard he had bitten his victim's nose resulting in an injury which required stitches.

Vaughan, formerly of Hill Chorlton, Newcastle-under-Lyme, but now living in Leicestershire, was sentenced to 18 months, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to do 180 hours' unpaid work.

He must also pay £2,000 in costs and £1,500 in compensation to his victim.

The court heard that an argument had started after last orders at the Wheatsheaf in Onneley on 7 April 2018.

Following an argument Vaughan grabbed the man by his T-shirt and held him down on a bench and bit him.

Detective constable Jennie Holland, of Staffordshire Police, said: "This was a nasty, violent assault which resulted in a painful injury."

He was sentenced on 9 June.
