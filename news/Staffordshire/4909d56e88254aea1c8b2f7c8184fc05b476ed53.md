A Stoke-on-Trent man who raped a woman in his car has been jailed for seven years.

Pavel Ocneanu, 30, of Ogden Road, Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, was found guilty of rape following a trial at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court last month. He was sentenced today at the same court (Thursday 7 May).

The court heard that in May 2018, the victim had been on a night out. She became separated from friends so decided to get a taxi home. She arrived home and got into another car with Ocneanu being the driver. He drove her away and raped her in his car. She fled the car and reported it to the police. He was arrested a short time later in Shelton.

Ocneanu will also be placed on the Sex Offenders Register for life.

Investigative Officer Janine Shropshire, of the force's CID North team, said: "This was a very serious offence and Ocneanu will serve a prison sentence for what he has done.

"I want to commend the victim for having the courage to come forward and have the confidence in us to bring this case before the courts."
