Detectives investigating the fatal stabbing of a Stoke-on-Trent man are releasing new photos of him in a fresh appeal for information.

It is now one month since Anas Chergat was found with stab injuries in Etruria on 23 August.

Detective Inspector Alan Lyford, from the force's Major Investigation Department, is keen to speak to people who may be able to help investigators build a better picture of Anas's lifestyle and movements and hopes the photos may jog memories.

Police were called at around 2.40am on Friday 23 August to reports of a man - later named as 26-year-old Anas - suffering stab injuries in Josiah Wedgwood Street, Etruria.

Emergency services attended the incident but sadly, Anas died at the scene.

DI Lyford said: "We are making progress with our enquiries and have spoken to a number of people as well as making arrests.

However, we need to build a more complete picture of Anas's lifestyle and his movements on 22 and 23 August to assist us with our enquiries."

A 44-year-old man and a 29-year-old man, both from Stoke-on-Trent, arrested in connection with the death have been released under investigation.

Anyone with information, CCTV or dash-cam footage is asked to ring 101 quoting incident number 52 of 23 August.
