Police are calling on parents to check in on their children this evening after a dispersal order was issued for Rugeley.

The notice - which focuses on the area bordered by Sandy Lane, Penkridge Bank Road, Fernwood Drive, Station Road and Armitage Road - gives officers extra powers in their crackdown on anti-social behaviour and comes after police were notified of a large group of teenagers travelling into the town from Hednesford.

The order, granted under section 34 of the Anti-social behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014, gives officers the power to disperse anyone for the purpose of or reducing the likelihood of members of the public in the locality being harassed, alarmed, distressed or the occurrence of crime and disorder.

Failing to comply with an order is a criminal offence and police can return anyone under the age of 16 to their home address. They can issue the notices for a period of up to 48 hours and anyone found breaching a notice is liable to be arrested and face further action.

The order began at 18:30 this evening (6 July) and can last 48 hours - unless extended.

Response Inspector Jonathan Staite said, "We've issued this dispersal order after being notified of a large group of teenagers congregating in and around Rugeley train station this evening - having travelled from Hednesford.

"These powers are vital in helping us combat anti-social behaviour in our county but I would like to stress that our officers will only use these where absolutely necessary.

"I would now like to appeal to parents and guardians. Do you know where your children are tonight? Do you know what they are up to? Do you know who they are with? Please help us in keeping our communities and your children safe."

Anyone with any concerns can contact Staffordshire Police by calling 101, reporting online at https://www.staffordshire.police.uk/report or sending a direct message on Facebook or Twitter.
