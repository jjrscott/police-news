Detectives investigating an incident at a park in Newcastle on Tuesday (24 September) are appealing for people who may have dash cam or mobile phone footage to come forward.

The incident happened at around 6.30pm at a park, known as The Wammy, on Wilmot Drive and resulted in four people being treated at Royal Stoke University Hospital for injuries caused by a potential firearm. None of the injuries are believed to have been serious.

Detective Inspector Lucy Maskew, of CID, said: "We have been following up a number of lines of enquiry since the incident. We believe there were a number of vehicles in the car park at the time and we are keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the incident.

"Do you have dash cam or mobile phone footage of the incident or of the area around the time of the incident? If so, we're keen to hear from you."

Anyone with information or CCTV/dash cam footage is urged to call 101 reference 621 of 24 September or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
