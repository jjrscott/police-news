Police are now in a position to name the motorcyclist who sadly died following a road traffic collision in Tunstall on Friday 6 December.

Wayne Whiston, aged 51, from Stoke-on-Trent, was riding his black Suzuki motorcycle on the A527 (Reginald Mitchell Way) at the junction with the A500, when he was involved in a collision with a lorry at around 10.50am.

Despite the efforts of members of the public and emergency service staff, Wayne was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

Specialist officers are supporting his family, who would like to thank everyone who has kindly passed on their condolences. They have requested that their privacy is respected at this difficult time.

Officers from the Staffordshire and West Midlands Serious Collision Investigation Unit continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding the collision. They are appealing for relevant dash-cam footage or anyone who saw either of the vehicles before the incident to contact them on 101 quoting incident 227 of 6 December or by emailing: ciu@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk.
