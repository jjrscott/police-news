A stop and search by officers has led to an Uttoxeter man being jailed for five years over drugs possession.

Andrew Springall, now aged 31, of Bridge Street, was stopped as he was about to get into a car by officers in the street he lived at about 5.35pm on 13 November.

They found a bag of cocaine in his possession and arrested him. When they searched his home address they then uncovered more cocaine worth about £600, £700 in cash, scales and a mobile phone.

The same team of officers had previously executed a warrant at Springall's home address in November 2019 where cocaine was found.

Springall was subsequently charged with being concerned in the supply of cocaine between September 15th and November 15th 2019, possession of a controlled Class A drug (cocaine), possession with the intent to supply a controlled Class A drug (cocaine), possession of a controlled Class C drug, and possessing criminal property.

And on Friday, Springall pleaded guilty to the charges at Stafford Crown Court where he was handed the five-year custodial sentence.
