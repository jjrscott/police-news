Police are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Newcastle-under-Lyme.

Officers were called on 20 January to reports that at around 5.15pm that evening a woman was attacked by a man whilst walking on a cycle path, which runs past the rear of the college towards the area known as the Whammy at Knutton. The man pushed her to the ground before stealing cash. The offender then ran off in the direction of the college.

Police believe passers-by, joggers or cyclists may have witnessed the attack and are urging people to come forward.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 565 of 20 January call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
