Specialist serious collision investigation officers are appealing for witnesses to a fatal road traffic collision in Burton last night (1 October).

The collision took place at around 5pm on St Peter's Bridge and involved a motorcycle and a car. Despite the best efforts of a fellow motorist and paramedics, the 32-year-old motorcyclist was pronounced dead at the scene.

A 72-year-old man who was arrested at the time has now been released. No further action will be taken against him and investigators will now treat him as a witness.

The road was closed while specialist officers from the West Midlands Serious Collision Investigation Unit examined the scene.

If you witnessed the collision or have relevant dash-cam footage, please contact 101 or email ciu@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk quoting incident 560 of 1 October.
