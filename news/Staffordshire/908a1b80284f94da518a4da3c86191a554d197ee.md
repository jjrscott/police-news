Officers from Staffordshire Police are appealing for information after a man was seriously assaulted in Tamworth.

Just before midnight on Friday 26 June, a 19-year-old man was knocked to the ground and assaulted, in what is believed to be an unprovoked attack. The incident took place near to Wilnecote Fish Bar on Watling Street in Tamworth.

The victim suffered cuts to his head and a fractured jaw which requires extensive surgery.

The suspect is described a white, late teens and of thin build. He was wearing a hooded top and was with two white girls of a similar age.

Officers are interested to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time including two passing motorists who stopped to help the victim.

Any witnesses or anyone with any information is asked to contact 101 or report online, quoting incident number 468 of 27 June. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
