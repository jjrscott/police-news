Officers from the Staffordshire and West Midlands Serious Collision Investigation Unit are appealing for witnesses following the death of a motorcyclist in the Staffordshire Moorlands.

Emergency services were called at 8.40am this morning (Thursday 23 April) to Cheltenham Avenue in Cheadle following reports that a motorcyclist had come off his bike.

Despite the efforts of an off duty paramedic and staff from West Midlands Ambulance Service, a 28-year-old man was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

An investigation is underway and his family are being offered support from specially trained officers.

We are appealing for witnesses or anyone in the immediate area with CCTV or relevant dash-cam footage to contact Staffordshire Police on 101 or email ciu@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk quoting incident number 121 of 23 April.
