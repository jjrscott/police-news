The family of serving Staffordshire Police officer, Luke Van De Sande, who sadly died following a road traffic collision last month have paid tribute to him.

In a statement they said: "Luke was a loving husband, son, brother, nephew and cousin - a real family man. He will be sorely missed by his family, friends and his colleagues at Staffordshire Police.

"Although Luke's life has been tragically cut short he touched the lives and hearts of so many people. His love and enthusiasm for life was contagious and he spread fun, laughter and mischief wherever he went.

"We will treasure the happy times and the wonderful memories we have of our precious Luke."

His family, who request privacy whilst they come to terms with their loss, are being supported by specially trained officers.

Luke's funeral will take place at Carmountside Crematorium on Wednesday 18th September at 11am.
