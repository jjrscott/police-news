Officers are appealing for information after a car-jacking in Lichfield.

Police were called to the A453 at the junction with Slade Road at about 5.15pm on Wednesday (11 Nov) to reports that a woman had been robbed after being threatened by a group of Asian men brandishing knives.

The victim, a 55-year-old woman, had been shopping when the four suspects - travelling in a black Toyota people carrier - collided with her black Volkswagen GTI car.

When she pulled over, the suspects threatened her with two large machetes and made her leave her vehicle before departing with both cars in the direction of Tamworth.

The victim was not injured in the robbery but was left very shaken.

DC Gareth Morris, of force CID South, said: "This was a brazen and terrifying car-jacking which left the victim traumatised.

"Thankfully, members of the public stopped to help the victim when they saw what happened and I would like to appeal to anyone who many have dashcam footage of the incident to get in touch with police as soon as possible."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 518 of 11 November, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
