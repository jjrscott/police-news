A 21-year-old man has been issued with an extended community behaviour order following instances of anti-social behaviour in Stone.

Brandon Dickenson, of The Paddocks, Yarnfield, was previously subject to an order. However, officers were able to extend this on 17 February to remain in place until 17 February 2022.

Chief Inspector Giles Parsons, of Stafford Borough Neighbourhood Policing Team, said he hopes the order will help to minimise the impact of offending on members of the Stone community.

Dickenson was also detained by officers on Monday morning (22 February) after a warrant was issued for his arrest on Wednesday (17 February) after he failed to appear in court over a charge of assault.

He was due to appear before magistrates at the North Staffordshire Justice Centre today (22 February).
