Three men have been arrested in connection with distraction burglaries in Stoke-on-Trent where men were reported to have posed as utility workers.

Officers received a report of a scam at an address on Brakespeare Street in Goldenhill that took place on Monday (18 May). A man was reported to have posed as a builder and took a small amount of cash from a man in his 50s at around 1pm but failed to return to carry out work.

Another report was received at around 5.50pm at an address on Scotia Road in Burslem on the same day.

A man, posing as a someone from the 'water board', knocked on the door of a woman in her 60s' house before leaving. A small amount of cash was taken.

A similar attempt was also reported in Henry Street, Tunstall, where a man knocked on the door of a house and told a woman he had arrived to fix a leak.

Thankfully, the woman kept the door closed and said she would call the landlord first but the man walked off.

Detective Inspector Steve Ward, from CID, said: "Though no one was injured, incidents such as these can really instil a fear in vulnerable or elderly victims.

"During this unprecedented time, a lot more elderly and vulnerable people are isolated in their homes and offenders will see this as an opportunity.

"We're urging people to be vigilant if they are approached at their home by anyone offering trade services or claiming to be from an organisation. Always ask for identification and if you are not expecting anyone or don't have an appointment, do not let them into your home.

"Keep all valuables and money in a safe location and contact the police immediately if you have any suspicions about doorstep callers."

Detectives have arrested a 55-year-old man from Warrington and a 54-year-old man and a 42-year-old man, both from Stoke-on-Trent, on suspicion of burglary.

They remain in custody at this time.
