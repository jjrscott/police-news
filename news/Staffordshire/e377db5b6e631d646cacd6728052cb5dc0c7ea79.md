Do you recognise this man? He was caught on camera committing theft at an Asda store in Tamworth and police are seeking witnesses or those who may know him to come forward.

On 24 December 2020, at the Asda site on the Ventura Shopping Centre, Bonehill, at about 11.45am we received a call from a woman stating she had withdrawn money from an ATM outside the store but forget to take it.

A man, aged in his 40s and balding, who was wearing a blue mask with a black bomber-style jacket and blue jeans then approached the machine and takes the cash before the ATM can withdraw it again. He then walked off into the carpark.

PCSO Joe Mason, from the Tamworth policing team, said: "Do you recognise the man in the CCTV image?

"We are asking anyone who might have been outside the store at the time and who saw anything, or saw which direction the man left, or anyone who might recognise the man in the image to come forward and help with our enquiries."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 223 of 24 December, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
