A getaway driver for a robbery where Â£5,000 was stolen from a Tesco store in Stoke-on-Trent has been jailed for 12 years.

Steven Banks, 35, of Burslem, pleaded guilty to robbery at Tesco Kidsgrove in a hearing at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on Friday (13 September).

The court heard that Banks accepted his role as the driver in the robbery, which occurred at 7.45am on 10 November 2017.

Forensic evidence helped link Banks, of Nile Street, Burslem, to the offence. A Ford Mondeo he had driven was abandoned nearby.

Two men entered the store and assaulted a store assistant who was transferring money from the mobile safe trolley to the tills. They made off in a car waiting on the car park. Enquiries are still ongoing.

Detective Chief Inspector Rob Taylor, of Staffordshire Police, said: "This was a violent robbery and a frightening experience for staff at the store. We are glad this is a lengthy sentence and we do all we can to bring violent offenders before the courts."
