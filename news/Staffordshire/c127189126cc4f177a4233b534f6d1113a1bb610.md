Detectives have launched an investigation after a 40ft trailer was stolen in Barton-under-Needwood.

Thieves used a white truck to take the trailer, which contained clothing, just before 10.45pm on March 2 after breaking into the site at Barton Business Park off Lichfield Road.

CCTV has captured two offenders dressed all in black and wearing high visibility vests forcing their way into the yard before connecting up the curtain-sided trailer and leaving moments later.

Detectives with CID South are also exploring the possibility a third person may have been operating as a look-out and are keen to speak with the owner of a white car seen on the business park at the time of the offence.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 0112 of March 3, or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
