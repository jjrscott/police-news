Detectives are issuing a CCTV image of a man wanted in connection with the use of stolen bank cards at an off-licence.

The man pictured walked into Leamore Wines on Wolverhampton Road, Pelsall, on 25 November 2020 and used cards stolen during a previous incident.

It is believed the offender lives either in Staffordshire or on the West Midlands Police force area.

A spokesman for Staffordshire Police said: "Do you know this person? Detectives would like to speak to him in relation to stolen bank cards that were used on 25 November 2020 at Leamore Wines, Pelsall.

"If you know his identity please call 101 quoting incident number 701 of the 25 November or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
