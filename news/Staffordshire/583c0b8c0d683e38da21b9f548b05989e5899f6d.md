A 74-year-old man's been found guilty of nine counts of historical sexual assault offences against a child in Staffordshire.

Ivan Keeling from Cheadle was found guilty of sexual assaulting a girl, aged between 11 and 14, between 2011 and 2014.

He was also found guilty of inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity, sexually assaulting a child under 16 and inciting a child under 16 to engage in sexual activity.

The trial at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court concluded on Wednesday 3 March with Keeling due to be sentenced next week.

Detective Constable Dawn Moody of Staffordshire Police said: "I want to pay tribute to the victim and the tremendous courage and bravery she showed in bringing this case to the courts.

"We will continue to do whatever is necessary to bring those responsible for these heinous crimes to justice, whilst ensuring the victims and their families are given the support they need."

Anyone who has suffered sexual abuse, or suspects others may be subject to sexual abuse, is urged to contact Staffordshire Police on 101.
