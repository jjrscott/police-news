A man who tried to give false details on arrest has been jailed for two years for drugs offences after heroin and cocaine were found in his pockets.

Police attended a flat in Aiden Court Road, Lichfield, on 13 June 2017 in an attempt to arrest another man who had failed to appear at court.

While approaching the flats there was a significant smell of cannabis. Officers entered and searched and arrested a man after 26 wraps of crack cocaine and nine wraps of heroin were found in his trouser pockets.

Cannabis, mobile phones and £430 cash were also seized. The drugs were later found to have a street value of £360 - £620.

The man gave the name of James Cordon, however following enquiries, it was confirmed the arrested man was really 20-year-old Kyran Frue.

Frue, of Dudley Road, Rowley Regis, pleaded guilty on 7 October at Stafford Crown Court to two counts of possession with intent to supply class A drugs.

He was jailed for 25 months for each count, the sentences to run concurrently.

PC Stephen Windridge, of Staffordshire Police, said: "We will not tolerate drug dealing in Staffordshire and will continue to work hard to bring those who think they can bring drugs into the county before the courts."
