Updated News Post

Officers are appealing for witnesses following the death of a man who fell from a bridge near Uttoxeter this morning (10 July).

A report of a road traffic collision involving a man and a HGV on the A50 westbound near the A522 was received by police just before 5am.

Sadly, a man in his 30s was confirmed dead at the scene. His family are being offered support from specially-trained officers at this difficult time.

The road was closed westbound between the A522 near Uttoxeter and the A521 at Blythe Marsh for several hours as officers from the Staffordshire and West Midlands Serious Collision Investigation Unit began their investigation into the circumstances surrounding the collision.

Any witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage is asked to get in touch by either calling 101 quoting incident number 082 of 10 July or by emailing the investigation team direct at ciu@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk.

We are aware of images of the scene being shared on social media. We would ask the public to consider the impact on the family and friends of those involved before choosing to share and comment on this content.
