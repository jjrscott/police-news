Detectives are investigating after a woman was assaulted and had her car stolen in Norton Canes on Monday (2 September).

At approximately 2.45pm, a grey Mercedes AMG C43 was stolen from Brownhills Road near to the Co-op.

The owner of the vehicle was approached by two men from a black Ford Focus. They were wearing hoods with face coverings, and one of them was carrying a hammer.

The offenders pulled the victim from her car, dragging her across the floor before driving off in her vehicle.

Both vehicles were driven away the Mercedes was driven in the direction of Burntwood Road and the Focus was driven in the direction of Brownhills Road.

Fortunately, the victim was not seriously injured but she was understandably left very shaken by the incident.

Detectives have launched an investigation, and any witnesses, or anyone with any information is asked to contact Staffordshire Police on 101 and quote incident number 377 of 2 September. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
