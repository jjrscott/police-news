Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a man was left with two fractures in his jaw following an assault in the early hours of yesterday (5 July).

A 27-year-old man was walking home and approached a woman on Mill Street in Cannock to check on her welfare just after 1am.

He then crossed the road outside Papa Joe's near the junction of Walsall Road and Avon Road/Mill Street when he was assaulted by a man from behind at around 1.33am.

The 27-year-old remains in hospital at this time.

A man in a grey hoody with diagonal stripes was believed to have been in the area at time and detectives are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen anyone.

Anyone with information or anyone who may have seen anyone suspicious is asked to message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter or call 101 quoting incident number 529 of 5 July.

Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
