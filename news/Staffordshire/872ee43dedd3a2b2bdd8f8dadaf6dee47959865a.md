Staffordshire Police launched its first ever Detective Constable Degree Holder Entry Programme (DC DHEP) in partnership with Staffordshire University in November.

Thirty new student officers took their attestation and were sworn in as police officers that month.

The force and Staffordshire University have worked in partnership to deliver the course, which is accredited by the College of Policing.

It offers a two-year intensive programme which combines a mix of on-the-job practical policing experience with detective teams, alongside academic tutoring and rotations in different departments.

Once the students have successfully completed the course, they will be awarded a Level 6 Graduate Diploma in Professional Policing Practice by Staffordshire University and a PIP 2 Detective delivered under licence by the College of Policing. They will then be posted as a Detective Constable in the force's investigations directorate.

In the fifth of a series of profiles looking at the candidates on the course, we meet Kelsey Johnson, who gives us an insight into what made her decide to join the course.

**_NAME:_** Kelsey Johnson

**_AGE:_** 27

**_PREVIOUS POLICE EXPERIENCE:_** Staffordshire Police's Northern Prosecution Hub and Knowledge Hub

**_INSPIRATION TO BE A DC:_** Emulating my aunt as a DI for Staffordshire Police

"I heard about this role through a colleague who was also interested in applying. I believed it was out of my reach, but once I had discussed the process with my colleague, I decided I would go for it as it seemed a perfect new route for me to try.

"My role at the Prosecution Hub was to ensure the effective management of criminal and traffic-related cases at the point of receipt from officers through to finalisation, and to support victims and witnesses to navigate the Criminal Justice System as smoothly as possible. I believe that my communication skills will transfer over well into my new role.

"My role at the Knowledge Hub involved undertaking research using a wide variety of sources to assess, evaluate and disseminate information to support decision making at a strategic, tactical and/or operational level. I believe my thorough research skills will be perfect for the role.

"But I rarely saw my projects come to fruition once I had completed and submitted the work, therefore I am just looking forward to taking full ownership of an investigation from beginnin-to-end and knowing I have done the best possible work for that injured party.

"I have had family members work for the police for as long as I can remember and I have always been interested in their day-to-day work. So when this opportunity came up it was too good to miss.

"My auntie is a serving Detective Inspector and she has particularly been a huge influence in me going for this position as I am very proud of what she does. I hope to one day be like her."
