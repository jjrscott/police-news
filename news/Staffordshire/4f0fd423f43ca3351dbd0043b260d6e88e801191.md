Detectives investigating the deaths of a man and a woman in Burton on Wednesday are continuing their enquiries today.

The bodies of a 31-year-old man and a 33-year-old woman were discovered at an address on Henhurst Hill at around 11.05pm on Wednesday (4 September).

A two-year-old boy was found unharmed at the property and is being cared for by family.

A cordon is in place as forensics enquiries continue and local neighbourhood officers will be in the area to continue providing reassurance to the community.

Detective Chief Inspector Dan Ison, senior investigating officer, said: "An investigation into the two deaths is on-going.

"Following initial enquiries, the 33-year-old woman's death is being treated as murder and the 31-year-old's death is not being treated as suspicious. At this stage, we are not looking for anyone else and a post mortem is due to take place to establish the cause of death.

"The man and woman's families have been informed and have asked that they are given privacy at this difficult time.

"Anyone with information is asked 101 quoting incident number 790 of 4 September."
