Police are appealing for witnesses after a delivery driver's van containing dozens of parcels was stolen.

The theft of the white Ford Transit took place on Leek Road in Abbey Hulton at 10.20am on January 2 while the driver was away from the vehicle.

It is believed there were around 45 packages inside the vehicle at the time of the theft. The van was later discovered off Eaves Lane - however the parcels had been removed.

The theft represents the latest offence in the city where a courier has been targeted while out making deliveries.

Chief Inspector Mark Barlow, of Stoke-on-Trent North Neighbourhood Policing Team, has reiterated the advice previously given to delivery drivers by the force. He said: "We are continuing to urge all couriers to ensure their vehicles are fully secured while making a delivery and the keys are kept on their person. Offenders will act quickly when they see an opportunity and we would not want to see anyone's livelihood's impacted by thieves."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 0127 of January 2, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
