Staffordshire Police is calling on caravan owners to be extra vigilant after a number of reported thefts across the county.

In recent weeks we've received calls from concerned residents over men seen acting suspiciously around caravans parked outside homes.

One report suggested two men tried to take a caravan off a driveway claiming they had thought it was for sale in the Staffordshire Moorlands.

We're now urging caravan owners to ensure their property is locked correctly and secure, making sure they're also registered with the CHIS.

Detective Superintendent Colin Mattinson said: "We understand there has been a lot of concern over reports across the county in recent weeks and we are looking into each report.

"We're asking for people to be aware of those enquiring about the potential sale of a caravan. Those responsible for these crimes won't hide and will be very open about wanting to buy your vehicle - moving on before returning to take your caravan at a later time.

"We ask that caravan owners are vigilant and get in touch if they have any information or concerns."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
