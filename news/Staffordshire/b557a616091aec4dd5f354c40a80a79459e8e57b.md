Just before 5pm yesterday (Wednesday 11 December), police were called to reports of a two-vehicle collision involving a silver Vauxhall Meriva and a red Mercedes CLC220 on Alton Road in Threapwood (B5032).

Sadly, despite the efforts of the emergency services, the driver of the Vauxhall Meriva, an 80-year-old from Stoke-on-Trent, died at the scene. Specialist officers are supporting the man's family.

The driver of the Mercedes, a 43-year-old man from Stoke-on-Trent, was taken to the Royal Stoke University Hospital. A passenger in the Mercedes, a 25-year-old man from Stoke-on-Trent, received minor injuries.

Officers from the Staffordshire and West Midlands Serious Collision Investigation Unit are appealing for witnesses who may have seen the vehicles before the collision or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to contact 101, quoting incident 587 of 11 December.
