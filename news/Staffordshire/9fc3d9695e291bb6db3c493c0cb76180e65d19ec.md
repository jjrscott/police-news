More than 30 vehicle defect notices were issued to drivers as officers stopped cars with light defects and other faults in a road traffic operation in the Staffordshire Moorlands.

The operation, which focused on rural areas in and around Leek, Cheadle and Biddulph ran for two weeks and was part of Staffordshire Police's new roads policing plan named Operation Lightning.

Operation Lightning aims to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries on the county's roads and to disrupt and deter criminals' use of the road network.

Officers issued 34 tickets, mainly for lighting offences and seized four cars. Offences including no insurance and a vehicle being driven on false plates were disclosed during the operation.

Sergeant Andy Bland, of Staffordshire Moorlands Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We developed this operation to focus drivers in the Moorlands on road safety, their responsibilities to themselves and their passengers, and other road users.

"There are many areas of the Moorlands where there is no street lighting and it is vital that drivers ensure their vehicles are safe and roadworthy. Having defective tyres or a broken light can have serious consequences on these long winter nights, especially in difficult or deteriorating weather conditions."
