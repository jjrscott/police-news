Detectives are appealing for witnesses after four people were injured by pellets fired in an incident in Newcastle-under-Lyme last night (Sept 24).

Firearms units were sent to a park known as the Wammy, off Wilmot Drive, Newcastle at around 6.30pm.

It was first thought an air rifle was used, but following treatment at the Royal Stoke Hospital further tests and enquiries are underway to understand the type of weapon used.

Four people have been treated for injuries, including an injury to a finger and a right calf, but none are believed to be serious.

Detectives believe a blue VW and a silver VW Golf seen in the area may be involved and want to speak to a man described as white, 5ft 11ins tall, slim-build and middle-aged, wearing a black hoody.

Detective Inspector Lucy Maskew, of Staffordshire Police, said: "It is not yet understood what the motive for the incident was, but we are following up a number of lines of enquiry.

"We're keen to speak to anyone with information about this incident."

Anyone with information or CCTV/dashcam footage is urged to call 101 reference 621 of 24 September or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
