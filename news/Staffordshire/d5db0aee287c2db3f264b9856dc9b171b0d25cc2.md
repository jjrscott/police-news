Staffordshire police officers, staff and Specials are to be honoured at an awards ceremony this evening (Tuesday 26 November).

Police officers, staff and Specials will be presented with their long service medals by Chief Constable Gareth Morgan, alongside Lord-Lieutenant, Ian Dudson, at a ceremony which recognises and celebrates the outstanding work at Staffordshire Police.

Tonight's event at the Council Chambers in Stafford will also see officers and a member of the public receiving Royal Humane Society Resuscitation Certificates alongside three young boys receiving Royal Humane Society Commendation Certificates for their actions that potentially saved a man's life from hypothermia.

Chief Constable Gareth Morgan, said: "Tonight we will be acknowledging officers and staff who have served 20 years and 40 years and Specials who have served 9 years and 43 years. Recognising and celebrating the outstanding work of officers and staff is something we pride ourselves on at Staffordshire Police."
