Our officers were put through their paces at a training course where they learn tactics to deal with a number of situations including disorder, protests and crowd control.

The public order training, which takes place in a disused hangar at the regional training unit in Albrighton, saw a number of officers from Staffordshire, West Midlands, West Mercia and Warwickshire refresh their knowledge on how to deal with public order and public safety incidents such as protests, disorder, football matches, tackling violent/armed people or any crowded events.

As part of the annual refresher course, officers were put in life-like scenarios where protests or disorders may escalate. The training includes a range of tactics including cordon patrolling and negotiating to missiles being thrown and how to tackle people armed with weapons.

Chief Superintendent Elliott Sharrard-Williams, head of operational support directorate, said: "We regularly train our officers to give them the skills to safely manage a variety of events from football matches to serious disorder.

"The training undertaken at our regional training centre closely simulates a variety of real life situations officers may face in order to ensure they are match fit to protect our communities."
