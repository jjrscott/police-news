A Kidsgrove man has been jailed for a total of three-and-a-half years for drugs and driving offences.

Mark Holland, aged 40, of Fifth Avenue, was jailed after pleading guilty to two charges of possession with intent to supply a class-A drug (heroin and crack cocaine) on 9 January in Kidsgrove.

Holland also pleaded guilty to dangerous driving on the same date in Fifth Avenue, and driving without a licence or insurance. He was disqualified from driving.

The court heard that Holland had driven at officers in an attempt to get away and had hit a garden wall and fences.

DS Richard Hudson, of the Disruption Team North, said "Colleagues from the Disruption Team and Tactical Support Team worked together to ensure a large quantity of class A drugs, believed to be worth in excess of Â£4,000, did not reach the streets."

Anybody with any information regarding to drug activity in their area should call 101 or alternatively crime stoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.

Holland was sentenced at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on 12 March.
