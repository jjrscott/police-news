Police in Tamworth are carrying out hotspot patrols across the town over the festive period to cut crime and anti-social behaviour.

Operation Tinsel will see local neighbourhood officers and PCSOs out and about in the town centre, surrounding shopping areas and leisure facilities to tackle criminality and provide reassurance.

Officers will be joining with partners in retail and local business to ensure shoppers and revellers stay safe while Christmas shopping and visiting the town.

Sgt Felicity Bownds said: "During the Christmas period, shoplifting and other crime can sometimes rise and we will be increasing our activity to tackle these issues and deter and detect criminal activity, including shoplifters and car thieves across Tamworth."

She said: "We are asking the public to take extra care of their property when out shopping and to ensure that any gifts purchased are locked and out of sight within their vehicles.

"People should also take care with their bags and wallets to ensure bank/credit cards and money are safely concealed from view.

"Our Christmas and New Year initiative should ensure Tamworth remains a safe and secure environment for residents and visitors to enjoy their festive activities.

"Shoppers are also asked to help ensure they don't become victims of crime by taking care of their property while out shopping and to ensure any gifts purchased are locked and out of sight within their vehicles and purses and wallets are carefully concealed from view."
