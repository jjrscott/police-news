Officers are advising members of the public to stay at home to watch the demolition of the concrete chimney at Rugeley Power Station this weekend.

The demolition, which is due to take place on Sunday 24 January at 8am, will see explosives used to bring down the main 183m-high concrete chimney.

As part of the national coronavirus lockdown, people interested in viewing the demolition are urged to watch the live-stream which will be made available at: www.rugeleypower.com/

Local businesses and residents should have already received notice of the planned demolition in the form of leaflets distributed by company engie.

The demolition exclusion zone will extend onto the A51, so a road closure and diversion will be in place for a number of hours while the work takes place.

On the day, special constables from the force will be present to assist staff at the power station with the road closures and will also be on hand to uphold national coronavirus lockdown rules.

Chief Inspector Becky Hyde, of Cannock neighbourhood policing team (NPT), said: "We understand people will be interested in viewing the demolition, but are encouraging everyone to stick to the lockdown rules and view the event from the comfort and safety of their own homes.

"Officers will be on hand during the morning to speak to anyone they feel is not adhering to the government's national coronavirus lockdown restrictions and will issue fixed penalty notices where necessary.

"We appreciate the public's support in this and know they are doing all they can to protect themselves and others from this devastating illness."
