Three people have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after police were called to reports of an altercation in Lichfield last night.

Officers attended a property in Reynolds Close shortly before 11:30pm on Saturday 2 May after receiving a call from colleagues at West Midlands Ambulance Service reporting a man had been stabbed.

A 20-year-old man was taken to hospital by paramedics where he remains in a critical condition. Two men - aged 20 and from Lichfield - remain in police custody alongside a 49-year-old woman from Rugeley.

A scene remains in place with an investigation underway and local enquiries taking place.

There will be an increased police presence in the area for reassurance purposes.
