Two neighbourhood police officers have been praised by their Chief Inspector for their efforts in bringing four car thieves to justice.

The force worked alongside West Midlands Police in investigating a number of offences that occurred across South Staffordshire between the winter of 2017 up to August 2018.

It resulted in the jailing on 5 March of Lee Perry, aged 45, of Hawthorne Road, Willenhall; Curtis Rudd, 22, of Sandwell Place, Willenhall; Liam Baker, 26, of Dartmouth Avenue, Walsall; and Chad Worgan, 25, of Keegan Walk, Bentley, at Birmingham Crown Court.

Perry received four years, Worgan three years and 10 months, Baker three years and eight months and Rudd three years and five months respectively.

Staffordshire Police Neighbourhood & Partnerships Chief Inspector Dave Wain said: "This is excellent work and demonstrates the ongoing commitment to tackle cross-border criminality and bring offenders to justice and keep people safe.

"These incidents were investigated by PC Sean Hinsley and PC Richard Rackham respectively. This was a lengthy investigation to ensure the evidence was key in ensuring as many offenders from these incidents as possible were identified and prosecuted."

PC Richard Rackham added: "The offenders were key members of an organised crime group who had, during this period and beyond, been responsible for stealing a number of vehicles across South Staffordshire and the West Midlands. They had meticulously conspired together to attend the locations and steal vehicles they had chosen.

"Staffordshire Police will always strive to ensure such offenders are identified and prosecuted."
