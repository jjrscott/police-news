Police are appealing for witnesses after an elderly woman was targeted in a distraction burglary in the Park Hall area of Stoke-on-Trent.

At approximately 6:45pm on Thursday 27 February, the 88-year-old victim was at her home in Harington Drive when she answered the door to a male claiming to be from the police.

On opening the door the victim was pushed to the ground and threatened with a screwdriver before the offender - who was wearing a mask - stole thousands of pounds in cash.

The victim was taken to hospital with bruising to her arms and legs.

Staffordshire Police are asking for anyone to come forward if they witnessed the incident, saw any suspicious males, vehicles or activity in the area during the afternoon of 27 February.

We are also appealing for anyone with CCTV or dashcam footage of the area to come forward.

We have stepped up patrols in the area and are carrying out door to door inquiries.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 654 of 27 February, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
