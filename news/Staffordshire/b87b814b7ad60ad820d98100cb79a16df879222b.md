A man has been jailed for nine years with an extended license for six years after pleading guilty to two counts of rape.

David George Wainwright, 26, of Smithpool Road, Fenton, was jailed on Friday (19 February) at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court.

Allegations of rape were reported to the force in March 2019 and an investigation was launched. Wainwright was interviewed and admitted all allegations. The offences took place in Stoke-on-Trent.

Wainwright was also placed on the Sex Offenders Register for life.

Detective Constable Annie Blairs, of the Rape and Serious Sexual Offences team, said: "Understandably, this has been an extremely upsetting time for the victim. I am pleased she was spared the ordeal of going through a trial and that Wainwright is now serving a custodial sentence.
"We take all reports of rape and sexual assault seriously and have specially-trained officers available to help. If you have been a victim please don't suffer in silence."

Detective Inspector Zoe Kelsall, of the Rape and Serious Sexual Offences team, said: "My hope is that this conviction will provide reassurance to other victims of sexual offences, giving them the confidence to report their ordeal in the knowledge that they will be listened to and supported."

Anyone who has suffered sexual abuse, or suspects others may be subject to sexual abuse, is urged to contact Staffordshire Police on 101.

Alternatively, the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
