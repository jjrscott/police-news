Detectives are appealing for witnesses after an elderly lady had a large amount of cash taken from her home in Stoke-on-Trent.

Between 11am and 2pm yesterday (12 March), three men knocked at a 93-year-old woman's door on Kingsnorth Place, Meir, and offered to do some driveway cleaning for cash.

The woman accepted the offer, but found that the men had failed to complete any work and left. The elderly lady later discovered a large quantity of cash had been taken from her home.

Detective Inspector Lucy Maskew, from CID, said: "This is a horrible offence whereby a vulnerable lady has been taken advantage of and has been left extremely shaken from the incident.

"An investigation is underway and I would ask anyone with information to come forward who may have seen any suspicious men, vehicles or activity in the area.

"We're also particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have dash-cam or CCTV footage from the area.

"Anyone with any information should call 101 quoting incident number 370 of 12 March or message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter.

"Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
