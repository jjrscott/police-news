Two men have been arrested on suspicion of theft from a motor vehicle as officers continue to crack down on offences of catalytic convertor thefts across the county.

The 27-year-old and 23-year-old, both from Derby, have been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

At about 8.35pm on Saturday (13 February), a resident of Woodrow Way in Chesterton, near Newcastle-under-Lyme, witnessed two males changing number plates on a grey Ford Focus.

A police patrol spotted and followed the vehicle at about 8.50pm and at 9.05pm it stopped on Leek Road. Various tools were found which are used in the stealing of motor vehicles and both men were detained.
