A national campaign to recruit 20,000 new police officers is launched today (Thursday) - urging people to join the police and ' _Be a force for all '_.

Chief Constable Gareth Morgan said: "I welcome the Government's announcement to increase funding to policing and their recognition the reduction in police numbers has to be addressed. The launch of today's national police recruitment campaign to recruit 20,000 additional police over the next three years will help us address the increasingly complex world of crime and the public's right to feel safe and secure. This uplift, the details of which are not yet clear, will accelerate our existing recruitment plans in Staffordshire which stepped up a gear earlier this year when we launched the new partnership with Staffordshire University to support entry routes into policing for those who will work and gain a degree and for those who will join with existing degree level qualifications.

We are now looking to increase the numbers being recruited this year. This is an exciting time to enter policing and we are looking for recruits from across the diverse communities of Staffordshire. If you want a varied and rewarding career and to make a positive difference serving the public in your community, policing could be for you."
