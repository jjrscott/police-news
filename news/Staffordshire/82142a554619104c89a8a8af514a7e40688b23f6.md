Police are appealing for information after thousands of pounds worth of chemical and electrical goods were among items stolen from a business in South Staffordshire.

It's believed three offenders broke into one of the units at Hilton Main Industrial Estate in Essington shortly after midnight on Wednesday 10 June.

A pallet of chemicals - which are normally found in paint - was among items taken and is valued at Â£17,000. A further 75, 25 litre drums were also taken, alongside two manufacturing pumps.

An investigation is underway with extensive CCTV enquiries taking place as officers look to track down those responsible.

Investigating Officer Ashley Copper said: "We're urging anyone who might have any information about these items to get in touch as soon as possible.

"These items are highly valuable and aren't something you'd be able to buy off the street - tending to come from the supplier directly.

"We are currently treating this as a targeted attack due to the nature of the items taken and the fact no other businesses have reported anything to us."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 127 of 10 June, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
