Officers have made a second arrest following a robbery at a baker's shop in Lichfield on Saturday (Jan 9).

We were called to Greggs at Baker's Lane, Lichfield, at around 7.40am after reports that two female members of staff had been threatened and forced to access a safe.

A Taser-type device was used on one of the women. She was unharmed, but understandably distressed by the incident. An undisclosed amount of cash was taken.

A 38-year-old man from Coventry was arrested in the city in the early hours of this morning on suspicion of robbery. He is in custody at this time.

The first arrest was made around an hour after the incident. Officers stopped a vehicle near Swadlincote in Derbyshire and arrested a man aged 33, also from Coventry, on suspicion of robbery, possession of class A drugs, and theft of a motor vehicle.

He has been released under investigation with bail conditions while enquiries continue.

Detective Sergeant Michelle Banks, of Staffordshire Police, said: "We have made two arrests and enquiries are ongoing. We want to thank the public for the support we've received and reassure people in Lichfield that this was an isolated incident.

"This was a frightening experience for the women at the shop and we welcome any information the public can provide to assist us."

Anyone with information that may assist us is urged to contact Staffordshire Police on 101 or via Facebook/Twitter referring to incident 100 of 9 January.
Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555111.
