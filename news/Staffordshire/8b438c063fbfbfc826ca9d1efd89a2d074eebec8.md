A man has died following a road traffic collision near to Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent.

Just after 10.50am yesterday (Friday 6 December) police were called to reports of a two-vehicle collision involving a black Suzuki motorcycle and a blue and white articulated heavy goods vehicle on the southbound A500/A527 (Tunstall Western Bypass).

Sadly, despite the efforts of the public and the emergency services, the rider of the motorcycle, 51-year-old from Stoke-on-Trent, died at the scene. Specialist officers are supporting the man's family.

Officers from the Staffordshire and West Midlands Serious Collision Investigation Unit are appealing for witnesses who may have seen the lorry or motorcycle before the collision or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to contact 101, quoting incident 227 of 6 December.
