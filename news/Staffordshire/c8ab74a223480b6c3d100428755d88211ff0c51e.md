Police are warning the public to look out for bogus officials following a case of fraud in Stoke-on-Trent.

Detectives were called on 11 January to reports that an elderly woman in Bucknall had been conned out of a sum of money after the fraudsters called her explaining there was a theft at her bank and she needed to withdraw money and hand it to their courier. They gave false police badge numbers, crime references and set up a password for their communications with her.

Once they secured the first sum of cash they asked the victim to withdraw a higher amount and informed her it was part of a larger police investigation.

Detective Constable Colin Rushton said: "No police officer or bank will ever ask you for your bank details or for you to hand over cash to them or anyone else.

"Please do not be fooled by these fraudsters and hang up the phone immediately if they are to contact you, before calling the police.

"These offenders target vulnerable people within the community in order to obtain money. Staffordshire Police takes all cases of fraud very seriously and will continue to investigate this incident. We hope this warning will ensure that no one else is conned out of their money."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 254 of 11 January, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
