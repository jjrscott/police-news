Detectives are this afternoon continuing to investigate after the body of a woman was found at a house in the Cliffe Vale area of Stoke-on-Trent.

Officers were called to a property in Scrivener Road at around 11.45am yesterday (13 August) where they discovered the body of a 45-year-old woman.

A post mortem will take place, but the death is being treated as suspicious at this time.

The woman is not being named at this stage, but specially trained officers are supporting her family, who have been informed.

A 48-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody.

Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Inspector Cheryl Hannan, said: "Enquiries are ongoing and officers are carrying out forensic investigations at the scene and house to house enquiries. We are asking if anyone has information to contact us on 101 or report online quoting 246 of 13 August."
