Two men have been charged after police were called out to reports of two stores being targeted in Audley.

It's after reports of around Â£120 worth of meat items being stolen from the Tesco and Co-op stores in Church Street in Audley at around 8.20am on Thursday (2 January) morning.

Two bottles of champagne were also taken from the Co-operative with staff verbally abused as the suspects left the store.

No weapons were involved.

Thirty-one-year-old Daniel Mills, of Halmer End, Newcastle-under-Lyme, and 27-year-old Christopher Jones, of no fixed address, have been charged with theft from a shop - whilst Mills has also been accused of using threatening behaviour.

A 38-year-old man, of Stoke-on-Trent, was released with no further action.
