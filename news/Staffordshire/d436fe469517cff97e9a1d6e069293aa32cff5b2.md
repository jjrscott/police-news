Detectives in Staffordshire have charged two men with manslaughter in connection with the death of a man in Stoke-on-Trent last year.

Police launched an investigation into the death of Christopher Walters after an incident on Wood Street in Longton on Wednesday 15 May 2019.

Thirty-one-year-old Benjamin Hunt and 50-year-old Jonathan Hassall, both from Longton, have now been charged with manslaughter.

They are due to appear before magistrates at the North Staffordshire Justice Centre in Newcastle-under-Lyme in June.

No further action will be taken against a 21-year-old man, from Stoke-on-Trent, who was arrested at the time.
