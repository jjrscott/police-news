A Burntwood man has been charged with drugs offences after a Transit van was stopped by officers yesterday (5 January).

James Taylor, aged 40, of Queens Drive, was a front seat passenger in the white van when it was stopped by officers on Chase Road after being spotted acting suspiciously.

Taylor was found to have a large packet of Class A drugs (crack cocaine) in his jacket pocket along with cash. A mobile phone was also seized. He was arrested and later charged with possession with intent to supply of a Class A drug (crack cocaine) and being concerned in the supply of crack cocaine. Upon later searching his home address, a larger quantity of cash was found.

He appeared before magistrates at the North Staffordshire Justice Centre this morning (6 January) and will appear at crown court at a later date.

The driver, another 40-year-old man from Burntwood, was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a controlled Class A drug (cocaine) and driving a motor vehicle with a proportion of a specified controlled drug above the limit. He has since been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

A 38-year-old woman, from Burntwood, was also issued with a conditional caution for being in possession of a Class A drug during the same incident.
