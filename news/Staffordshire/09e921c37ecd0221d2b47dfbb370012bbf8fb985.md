Officers are reminding people how to keep their keyless entry cars safe from would-be thieves.

If you have a keyless car:

 * Consider purchasing a key security pouch (a Faraday pouch). These block the ability of thieves to access the key signal.
 * Always check your car doors have locked after pressing your key fob.
 * Park in a garage if possible or another secure area where it's difficult to get the car out if accessed.
 * Consider using a steering lock.

DC Grant Dixon of Staffordshire Police CID said: "We would like to reiterate the need for keyless entry car owners to ensure their vehicles are locked at all times when not in use and to consider using Faraday bags to hold their keys to prevent cloning, and maybe use steering locks on their vehicles.

"And of course, please report all suspicious activity you notice in your communities and places of work."
