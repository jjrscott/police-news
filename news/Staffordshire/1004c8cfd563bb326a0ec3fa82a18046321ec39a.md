A 39-year-old man has pleaded guilty to attempted kidnap and sexual assault.

Jonathan Stuart Corfield, of the Leek area, admitted the offences at a hearing at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court today (28 November).

It follows an investigation by the force's Child Protection and Exploitation Team into an incident involving an 11-year-old in Cheddleton in July.

Corfield was remanded and will be sentenced at the same court on 23 January.
