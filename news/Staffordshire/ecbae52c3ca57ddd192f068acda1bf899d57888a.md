A teenage boy has been arrested on suspicion of attempted wounding following an incident in Fegg Hayes on Friday evening (Oct 2).

Officers received reports two boys were being chased by a group of other boys, possibly carrying weapons, in the Cumberbatch Avenue area at around 6.30pm.

A 15-year-old from the local area was arrested on suspicion of attempted wounding and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

A 15-year-old boy was taken to the Royal Stoke Hospital to receive treatment for head and facial injuries.

Chief Inspector Mark Barlow, area commander for Stoke North Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We have made an arrest but our enquiries are continuing and we would urge anyone who can assist us to get in touch. This was a violent and distressing attack by a group."
