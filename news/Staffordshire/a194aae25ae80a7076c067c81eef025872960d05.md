A response police officer will cycle 400 miles and run up 400 flights of stairs in a bid to raise money for a Stafford youngster who has childhood dementia.

PC Dan Haughton, who is a veteran of the Three Peaks' Challenge, is to cycle the distance from Stafford to Ben Nevis and scale the equivalent height of Britain's highest peak to raise money for five-year-old Penny Mills.

Penny has childhood dementia caused by a rare genetic condition called Sanfilippo syndrome.

Dan, who serves as a response officer in and around Stafford, has devised the challenge during lockdown and is keen for supporters to give him encouragement and donate to his JustGiving page.

His fundraising effort is called '400 Miles, 400 Floors for Penny.'

With travel to Scotland not currently possible, Daniel will complete his endurance fundraiser close to home.

"I'll cycle the 400 miles to Ben Nevis by clocking up miles in and around Staffordshire as I work towards my target and I'll run up 400 floors of stairs in full police uniform on 2 August.

"I'm really keen for support from my colleagues in Staffordshire Police and our wider community, and, of course, keen for donations which would help Penny to travel to Disney World in Orlando.

She's an adorable, happy little girl but this awful disease has already taken a big toll on her and her family. I would love for them to be able to have a trip of a lifetime, making some precious memories whilst they still can, and enjoying a break from the routine of everyday life managing her condition."

Dan is on Facebook and Instagram and has a JustGiving page set up on www.justgiving.com/fundraising/400miles400floors

Penny is featuring on 'Ross Kemp: Living with Dementia' on ITV, this Thursday (18 June).
