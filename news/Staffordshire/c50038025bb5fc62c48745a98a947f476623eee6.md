Three people from Stoke-on-Trent have been arrested following a fire at a property in Tunstall.

Emergency services were called to Knight Street just after 11.30pm on Monday (23 November) following reports of a house fire.

Four people were rescued from the property including a man in his 30s, who remains in a critical condition at the Royal Stoke University Hospital.

The house has been cordoned off whilst specialist investigators examine the scene to establish the cause of the fire.

This morning (Wednesday 25 November) a 36-year-old man, and two women, aged 20 and 41, were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. They all remain in police custody and an investigation is on-going.

Detectives are continuing to appeal for any witnesses to come forward. They are asking anyone with any relevant CCTV or dash-cam footage from Knight Street and the surrounding areas to get in touch.
