We are appealing for witnesses to an incident where a car was set alight in Tamworth in the early hours of New Year's Day (Friday 1 January).

We were informed by Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service of an incident in Valley Drive, Wilnecote.

The fire service had attended the scene at about 5.15am to find a grey Mazda 3 on fire and believe it had been started maliciously with an accelerant.

Witnesses report seeing two young males near the scene at about 5.06am coming from the direction of Boulder Close. One is described as tall and slim and carrying a mastic sealant can, while the other is described as having a slightly heavier build. Both were wearing dark clothing and had their faces covered. A couple of minutes later they ran back into Boulder Close and it looked like they had been filming the incident.

Enquiries are ongoing.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 281 of 1 January, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
