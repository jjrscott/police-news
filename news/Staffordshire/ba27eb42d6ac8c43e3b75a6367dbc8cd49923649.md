The family of a man who died after he was stabbed on Lightwood Road, Longton, have paid tribute to him.

This follows the formal identification of 23-year-old Matthew Dale from Dresden yesterday.

Matthew's family have said: "Matty was one of the kindest, most heart-warming individuals that you could ever wish to meet. He would have literally done anything for anybody. His tragic death has affected the whole community and anybody that had the pleasure of meeting him. They would tell you how much of a special guy he was. He will be sorely missed by a lot of good friends. The shock waves will be felt all around the whole of Stoke-on-Trent. Anybody wishing to pay respect, would you kindly lay flowers on Lightwood Road."
