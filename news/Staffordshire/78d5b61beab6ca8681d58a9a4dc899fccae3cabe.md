Officers from Stoke North Neighbourhood Policing Team are urging anyone who is considering attending a large gathering in the Smallthorne/Norton Heights area tonight (Thursday 2 July) to stop and think.

The force is aware that there is a possible large gathering being planned for this evening.

There will be a dedicated policing operation in place, with a higher police presence in potential hot spot areas. Wherever we see illegal activity taking place, we will take action.

Chief Inspector Mark Barlow, commander of Stoke North Neighbourhood Policing Team, said; "Following intelligence, officers will be patrolling the Smallthorne/Norton Heights area tonight to tackle any instances of crime and anti-social behaviour.

"The majority of young people go out to meet up with their friends and do not cause any problems. However, there is a number of individuals that have engaged in anti-social behaviour, which has caused the community to feel intimidated and worried by these larger groups.

"We understand the impact this behaviour can have on people living in the area, especially in light of the current COVID-19 concerns and government restrictions, so are asking teenagers to be mindful and considerate of others.

"I would like to stress that officers will only use dispersal powers where absolutely necessary and appeal to parents and guardians to ensure that they know where their children are, what they are up to and who they are with."

Anyone with any concerns can contact Staffordshire Police by calling 101, reporting online at https://www.staffordshire.police.uk/report or sending a direct message on Facebook or Twitter.
