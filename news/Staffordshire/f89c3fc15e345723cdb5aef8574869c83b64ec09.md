Detectives are urging the pubic to be vigilant following a spate of bogus callers and thefts in the south of the county.

Police were called to Chadsmoor in Cannock at 10.15am on Wednesday (12 February) after the offender approached the address claiming to scan the walls for damp. They distracted the victim and stole cash from the bedroom.

Similarly, on Thursday 30 January jewellery and documents were stolen from a home on Tinkers Green Road in Tamworth at around 11.20am. The offender was described as a white male, in his 20s, 5ft 6ins tall with dark hair and spoke with an Irish accent. He wore white gloves during the incident and gave the name Tom.

Cash was also stolen from an address in Wilnecote in Tamworth on Saturday 25 January at 2.45pm during a distraction burglary.

Sergeant Mark Burslem, of Cannock Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We are asking people to be vigilant if they are approached at their home by anyone offering trade services or claiming to be from an organisation. Always ask for identification and if you are not expecting anyone and they don't have an appointment do not let them into your home. Ensure all valuables and money are kept in a safe location. Local residents are encouraged to contact the police immediately if they have any suspicions about doorstep callers."
