A former Staffordshire Police officer has been jailed after admitting a sex offences involving children.

Lee Tatton, 54, from Trentham, Stoke-on-Trent, was jailed for six months yesterday (Monday 2 November) following his conviction at Birmingham Crown Court on 1 September.

He was convicted of attempting to engage in sexual communication with a child and four counts of making an indecent photograph/pseudo-photograph of a child.

Tatton, who was based in the force's Northern Resolution Centre, was arrested on 10 December 2019 by the force's Operation Safenet team and was immediately suspended. He was dismissed without notice for gross misconduct (discreditable conduct) on 21 September this year.

Deputy Chief Constable Emma Barnett said: "Throughout this investigation, the priority has been the welfare, protection and wellbeing of the children involved.

"All officers and staff are held to the highest standards of behaviour and Lee Tatton abused the position of trust afforded to police officers. He is serving a custodial sentence which reflects the seriousness of his criminal behaviour and he has been dismissed as a police officer. He has brought shame on himself and he does not represent the vast majority of colleagues who I know will be appalled by his behaviour."

A Sexual Harm Prevention Order was made for seven years and Tatton will be required to sign the Sex Offenders Register for seven years.
