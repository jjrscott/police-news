Police have ramped up patrols around a popular beauty spot to clamp down on anti-social behaviour in the area.

Officers covering parts of Cannock Chase near to Brocton say they have noted an increase of issues - including drug misuse - on car parks close to the Freda's Grave memorial.

Now PCs and PCSOs will increase the time they spend patrolling the area off Chase Road in an effort to target the troublemakers.

Sergeant Anthony La Planche, of Stafford Neighbourhood Policing Team, which has responsibility for part of Cannock Chase, said: "These are areas popular with visitors and we will not tolerate anti-social behaviour.

"In direct response to this we are increasing our patrols and sending a clear response to how seriously we take the concerns of the public."

Meanwhile visitors to Cannock Chase are being reminded to be respectful of the area.

Chief Inspector Becky Hyde, commander of the neighbouring Cannock Neighbourhood Policing Team - which has responsibility for large areas of the beauty spot, added: "Cannock Chase is designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and from wherever it is accessed it should be respected by everyone, for everyone to enjoy it. It is disappointing that a small few are choosing to act in an anti-social manner."

Anyone with concerns over anti-social behaviour should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
