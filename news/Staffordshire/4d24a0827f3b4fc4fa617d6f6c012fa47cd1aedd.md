A drug dealer who stored 81 wraps of cocaine in a bag of a well-known confectionery brand in her bedside drawer has been jailed.

Alexandra Florentina Dobre, 27, of Balfour Street, Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, was sentenced to two years imprisonment' at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on Wednesday (23 September) after pleading guilty to possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply.

On 7 August this year, officers from Longton stopped a grey Fiat Punto on Leek Road in Hanley. Dobre was driving the car and following a search six wraps of cocaine were found in her purse and she was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs.

Officers searched her home in Hanley and found 81 wraps of cocaine in her bedside drawer and cash and designer clothes were seized.

Sergeant Marc Proctor, of Stoke South Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We welcome the sentence Dobre has been handed by the courts. Drugs can cause a huge amount of disruption to the community and we are committed to tackling this behaviour.

"We would urge everyone to report drug matters to us. Let's work together and deter this behaviour from continuing."
