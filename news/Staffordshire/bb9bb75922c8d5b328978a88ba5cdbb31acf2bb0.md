Police are appealing for information after a pensioner was left with serious injuries following a reported break in at his home in Burntwood last week (Thursday 28 May).

Officers are now investigating having initially been made aware of the incident shortly before 7am this morning (Thursday 4 June).

A 73-year-old man was taken to hospital having been left with fractures to his eye socket and left shoulder after it's reported two males broke into his property on Thorpe Street and stole 98 gold coins - believed to be worth around Â£32,000.

Detective Sergeant Cathryn Holland of CID South says: "This is an abhorrent crime which targeted a vulnerable member of our community.

"Having only been notified of the incident this morning we are still at the scene carrying out a forensic investigation and local enquiries.

"We're determined to find those responsible and ensure the victim gets his belongings back."

Any witnesses or anyone with any information or dashcam footage from the area on that date should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 84 of 4 June, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
