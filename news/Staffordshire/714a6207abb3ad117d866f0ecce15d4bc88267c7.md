A man has been jailed after seriously assaulting a young child leaving them with head and facial injuries.

Jamie Cox, 33, of City Road, Birmingham, was sentenced to three years' imprisonment today (Wednesday 10 February) at Stafford Crown Court after pleading guilty to the assault and wilful abandonment of a young child.

Officers were called by West Midlands Ambulance Service on 20 February 2020 with reports that a young child had been seriously assaulted at a property in south Staffordshire. The child had significant bruising, swelling to her face, eyes and ears. The child was taken to New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton for treatment.

Cox was arrested in south Staffordshire two days later.

DS Shelley Burns, of the force's Child Protection and Exploitation Team, said: "As a child protection officer with over 10 years' experience, the child had some of the worst facial injuries I have seen.

"Thankfully, the child has recovered from the injuries.

"I welcome the sentence passed today. We all have a part to play in protecting the most vulnerable members of our society, and police and our partner agencies will do everything possible to bring to justice those who harm children."
