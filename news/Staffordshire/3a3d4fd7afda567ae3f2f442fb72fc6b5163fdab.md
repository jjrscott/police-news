A man who was caught with over £25k worth of drugs in his microwave by officers in Lichfield has been jailed.

Adrian Isherwood, 53, of Wardles Lane, Great Wryley, was jailed for 27 months at Stafford Crown Court on 19 February after pleading guilty to possessing cocaine with intent to supply and possessing cannabis with intent to supply.

Officers from the neighbourhood policing team executed a warrant at his previous address on Railway Lane in Burntwood on 18 August 2018 and a solid block of cocaine, worth just over £25k was discovered.

Cannabis, found in Isherwood's bath, over £1,100 in cash, scales and cutting agents were also found and seized by officers.

Chief Inspector Mark Smith, commander for Lichfield Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "Those intending to supply drugs will be caught by our team and Isherwood is just one of many who we work hard to bring to justice.

"Those involved in drugs will not be tolerated and will be brought before the courts."

Isherwood was jailed for 27 months for possessing cocaine with intent to supply and nine months for possessing cannabis with intent to supply to run concurrently.
