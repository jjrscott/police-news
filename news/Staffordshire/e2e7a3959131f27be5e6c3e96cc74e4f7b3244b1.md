There have been 146 arrests in the first two weeks of the operation which aims to Disrupt criminal activity in Staffordshire.

Two men were arrested after officers stopped a suspected stolen van being driven erratically in Cannock early yesterday morning (6 Oct).

Officers were patrolling Eastern Way when they spotted the van. Two men ran from the van when it was stopped in a nearby cul-de-sac.

A police dog detained one man and a second man was found hiding nearby. Two women were also arrested.

A 35-year-old man from Bloxwich was arrested on suspicion of theft of motor vehicle, driving with alcohol above the limit, dangerous driving and aggravated vehicle taking.

A 19-year-old from Cannock was arrested on suspicion of theft of motor vehicle. Both have been released under investigation while enquiries continue. The women who were arrested were released without further action.

Two men were also charged with drugs offences in Tamworth.
