Police have arrested two men over the weekend for threatening to cough over officers.

Officers attended two addresses in Cannock and Burton following reports of domestic incidents.

The men were arrested on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker, after they threatened to cough on the officers, claiming to have symptoms of Coronavirus.

Just before 11pm last night (Sunday 19 April) officers were called to reports of a domestic incident in Cannock. A 41-year-old, from Walsall, was arrested on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker and breach of a non-molestation order.

Officers were called to reports of a domestic incident in Burton just before 1am this morning (Monday 20 April). A 33-year-old man, from Burton, was arrested on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker.

Both remain in custody.
