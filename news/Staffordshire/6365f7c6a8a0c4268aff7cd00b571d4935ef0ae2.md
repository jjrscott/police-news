Two men have been arrested on suspicion of theft offences following a vehicle stop in Leek.

A black Renault Clio was stopped by officers at around 4pm yesterday afternoon (15 September) on Woodcroft Avenue.

Following a search of the vehicle, several bottles of alcohol with security tags were seized.

Officers arrested two men, aged 18 and 21, both from Merseyside, on suspicion of theft, going equipped and handling stolen goods.

They remain in police custody at this time.

Through our #WeDontBuyCrime campaign, Staffordshire Police is working to reduce and disrupt the market for stolen goods and help people to protect their homes, businesses and possessions by making them less attractive to would-be criminals.
