A 32-year-old man who was circulated as wanted by detectives in Stoke-on-Trent has been charged with conspiracy to commit nine burglaries in Staffordshire and Wales.

Michael Purcell, of no fixed address, was charged (9 January) with conspiracy to commit burglary with intent to steal. He is charged with conspiring with others to enter as a trespasser nine properties in Staffordshire and north Wales between 26 March 2018 and 11 April 2018 with intent to steal.

He is also charged with dishonestly receiving a VW Golf between the same dates, knowing or believing it to be stolen goods.

He was arrested in the West Midlands and will appear at Walsall and Aldridge Magistrates' Court this morning (Jan 9).

Purcell's brother, John, aged 29, of Priestfield Road, Ellesmere Port, was arrested in Northamptonshire and charged with the same offences on January 3.
