A Cannock man has been sentenced to eight years in prison for GBH after attacking a man with a machete.

Benjamin Kidd, of Birch Avenue, pleaded guilty and was handed his jail term at Stafford Crown Court yesterday (Monday).

The 30-year-old was seen at around 8.20pm on May 19, on Burwaye Close, in Lichfield, stepping out of a Toyota Aygo and attacking the victim with a sharp weapon. The court heard that the man was purchasing drugs from Kidd when he was attacked for 'short changing' him. The victim sustained serious injuries including a severed finger and cuts to his arm, head and back. His finger was not able to be reattached.

Police located the vehicle and searched the adjacent property, where they found Kidd hiding in the loft space behind a water tank.

Detective Constable Gareth Morris said: "We are pleased with the sentence given. This was a violent attack where the victim suffered serious life changing injuries and this behaviour will not be tolerated in Staffordshire."
