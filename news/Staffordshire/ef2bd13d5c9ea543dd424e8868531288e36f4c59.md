A Black Country man has been handed a suspended jail sentence after being found in possession of Class A drugs and a stun gun.

Nathias Daley, aged 19, of Manifold Street, Wednesbury, was searched on Park Street, Tamworth, on June 2, 2020, and was found in possession of heroin and crack, Â£155 in cash, a phone and a stun gun disguised as a torch.

Daley was later charged with possession with intent to sell Class A drugs and possession of a weapon for discharge of electrical incapacitation. He pleaded guilty to the charges and was held on remand until being sentenced to 16 months in prison, suspended for 24 months, at Stafford Crown Court on October 30.

DS Jon Bradbury from Staffordshire Police's Disruption Team South said: "We are delighted that due to the diligence and hard work of our officers on the ground we have been able to remove another drug dealer from the streets and make the community that little bit safer for the people we serve."
