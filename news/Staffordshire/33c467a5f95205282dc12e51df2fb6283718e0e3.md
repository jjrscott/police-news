Officers have released a picture of a woman's horrific injuries after she was injured in a non-stop collision in Burton-on-Trent.

A woman in her 40s was crossing the road on Branston Road at around 8.30pm on Friday (13 December) when a car hit her and knocked her to the floor.

The vehicle then made off from the scene in the direction of the A38.

Colleagues from West Midlands Ambulance Service attended the scene and took the woman to hospital.

She suffered a broken nose, extensive swelling and bruising to her face and six teeth were knocked out.

PC Chris Bower said: "This was a serious incident that left a woman with horrific injuries.

"An investigation into the collision is on-going but anyone with information or may have seen a vehicle make off from the scene is asked to get in touch.

"Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting incident number 677 of 13 December.

"Alternatively, for guaranteed anonymity, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
