Police are urging people to be vigilant following a suspicious incident in Burton where a man and women told an elderly woman they were 'carers' after she found the pair in her home.

The incident occurred in the Horninglow area on February 1 at around 5.15pm where the pensioner heard a noise before seeing them.

On being challenged they claimed to be carers with the man appearing to be holding a list. They subsequently left the property.

The man is described as white, in his 20s, tall, and at the time was wearing a black coat. The woman was also described as white, in her early 20s, around 5ft tall, of medium build, with fair-coloured curly hair and was wearing a white overall.

Nothing was stolen during the incident.

Enquiries are ongoing and officers believe the pair may have been travelling in a dark-coloured Citroen car.

Detective Constable Emma Hill, of CID South, said: "The woman acted in the correct way by challenging the pair and not believing their story. We would always ask anyone who finds someone in their home to contact the police immediately."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 0434 of February 2, or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
