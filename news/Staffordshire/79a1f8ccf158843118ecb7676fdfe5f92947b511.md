A Stafford man has been found guilty of the rape of a teenage boy following a trial at the town's Crown Court.

Richard Sherriff, aged 40, was found guilty of the rape of a boy aged between 13 and 15, between May 2008 and February 2009. The offence took place in Stafford.

Sherriff, of Main Road, Little Haywood, will be sentenced on 22 February at Stafford Crown Court. He has been remanded in custody.

He was found not guilty of assault by penetration of the same boy (aged 13 or over) between the same dates. The trial concluded on 29 January at Stafford Crown Court.

Detective Constable Alex Gould, of Staffordshire Police, said: "I want to pay tribute to the victim and the courage he demonstrated in helping us to bring this case before the courts.

"We will always do whatever it takes to bring offenders to justice, while ensuring victims and their families are offered the support they need."

Anyone who has suffered sexual abuse, or suspects others may be subject to sexual abuse, is urged to contact Staffordshire Police on 101.
