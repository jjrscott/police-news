Over 170 people have been caught speeding in just three days during a crackdown by motorway officers.

Central Motorway Police Group has launched a month-long speeding operation starting on Friday (8 May) on the M6 and A500 in Staffordshire following an increase of reports of speeders.

Officers will be patrolling the motorway and dealing with those who are speeding by speaking to them at the roadside or reporting them for summons to court.

Since the operation began, 177 speeding offences have been clocked, including drivers travelling at around 90mph in the 50mph roadworks section on the M6. A motorist was also caught driving at 121mph on the M6 Toll near Norton Canes services this morning (11 May).

The operation will continue to run throughout the month.

Inspector Sion Hathaway, from Central Motorway Police Group, said: "Since the lockdown began, traffic flow has dropped by over 50% on the networks we police. However, this has resulted in a large increase in the number of vehicles exceeding the speed limit by 15mph or more.

"Though the roads are quieter because of Covid-19, the law hasn't changed. Drivers should be sticking to the speed limit and anyone who isn't will be caught by our officers.

"Just a few extra miles per hour can make all the difference to a driver's reaction, braking distances and ultimately put other lives at risk. We're in an unprecedented time and we all want to keep each other safe and reduce the strain

on the NHS so carrying out these speed checks is a crucial way of protecting road users and ensuring everyone gets home safely every day."
