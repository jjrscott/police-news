"Stoke South Neighbourhood Policing Team, together with Stoke-on-Trent City Council officers, Brighter Futures' rough sleeping team, and other partners, are working closely on a daily basis to address issues of concern raised by residents and businesses in the Longton town centre area.

"This includes offering and providing support to those people who are in need and where necessary by taking appropriate enforcement action against those individuals who are committing crime or anti-social behaviour in and around the town.

"Crime and anti-social behaviour incidents have actually reduced in and around Longton town centre area over the last 12 months, with crime down by 28 per cent and anti-social behaviour down 32 per cent. This provides an indication that over the longer term this joint working approach is having a positive impact although it is acknowledged that there are some current issues that may be causing concern to local businesses which are being investigated and addressed.

"Over the coming weeks Staffordshire Police, Stoke-on-Trent City Council and other partners will be offering an opportunity for direct engagement with local businesses in the town to discuss any concerns and will also be delivering a 'week of action' in the town from 21 September. More information about this will be provided in the next week."
