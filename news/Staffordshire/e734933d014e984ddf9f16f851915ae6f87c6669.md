Officers are appealing for information after two more incidences of catalytic convertor thefts and an attempted theft from motor vehicles across the county.

The first happened at about 7pm on Friday (12 February) in Sefton Road, Dosthill, Tamworth.

The victim noticed two black cars - one of which was a Volkswagen - parked next to their vehicle and the following morning (Saturday 13 February) they noticed the catalytic converter was missing off their Renault.

And today (16 February), two similar thefts were reported in Codsall.

At about 12.50am a resident of Chapel Lane reported theirs had been taken from their silver Honda Jazz. They reported seeing four males flee in a silver Volkswagen Passat.

And at about 1.50am a resident of Madeira Drive reported that there was an attempt to steal the catalytic converter from their Honda CR-V. This time the would-be thieves were disturbed and fled in a silver Vaulkswagen.

Anyone with any information or who saw or heard anything suspicious at these times should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 309 of 13 February, or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
