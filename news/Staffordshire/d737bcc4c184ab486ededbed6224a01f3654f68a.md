Staffordshire Police has welcomed the first wave of new officers via the Degree Holder Entry Programme, in partnership with Staffordshire University.

Forty-six new student officers, recruited in December, took their attestation and were sworn in as police officers this week.

The introduction of the Degree Holder Entry Programme provides a new entry route for those who wish to join Staffordshire Police and who already have a degree in any subject.

It offers a two-year practice-based programme after which individuals receive a Level 6 Graduate Diploma in Professional Policing Practice.

The force and Staffordshire University have worked in partnership to deliver the course, which is accredited by the College of Policing.

T/Chief Constable Nick Baker said: "I have personally welcomed the first group of Degree Holder Entry Programme (DHEP) to Staffordshire Police this week and was privileged to join them as they took their attestation and were sworn in as police officers.

"This new route into policing is designed to equip officers with the skills they need to tackle increasingly complex crime.

"We are looking for a broad range of people, who can make a real difference to the diverse communities we serve in Staffordshire. As policing grows more complex and demands on our services increase we need people with the right skills and experiences to meet these challenging requirements. **

**Additional officers will be recruited into Staffordshire Police in 2020/21, as part of the national Uplift programme.
