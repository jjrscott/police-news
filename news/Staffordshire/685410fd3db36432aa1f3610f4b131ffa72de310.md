A 39-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder following an incident in Newcastle-under-Lyme yesterday (Dec 10).

Officers were called to Grosvenor Road in Newcastle at 10.20pm to reports a man and woman had suffered stab wounds. They were given treatment and the man was taken to hospital but his injuries are not life-threatening.

A police cordon is in place in the street while enquiries continue. A firearms team initially attended the street as weapons were reported.

A man, of no fixed address, was arrested shortly afterwards in Hartshill Road and is now in custody. The suspect and injured parties are known to each other.
