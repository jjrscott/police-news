Do you recognise this man? We are appealing for information as to his identity relating to an incident where a theft occurred at a Co-op store in Tamworth.

The Bolehall branch on Amington Road reported the theft having occurred at about 4.20pm on Thursday 3 December where chocolate worth about Â£50 was taken.

We want to speak to the man seen in the CCTV image from the store. He is described as white, aged in his late 20s or early 30s, and about 5 ft 4 in in height. He had a dark or ginger beard and a tattoo on his left hand, and was wearing a blue jacket with a green, white and blue pattern on, black polo shirt with white trim on the collar, a black neck scarf, grey-ish jeans and grey trainers.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 263 of 4 December, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
