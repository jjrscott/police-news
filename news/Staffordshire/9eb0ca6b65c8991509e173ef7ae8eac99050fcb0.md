A woman driver who tragically died in a collision with an HGV on the M6 in the early hours of Saturday (23 January) can now be named.

Beth Malpass, aged 27, from the Dudley area, was driving her red MG MG3 when it was involved in a collision with a white DAF Trucks HGV at about 1am on Saturday close to Junction 11a southbound.

Specialist officers continue to support Beth's family, who have politely requested that they are left alone at this sad time to grieve privately.
The driver of the HGV was not injured.

Witnesses who may have seen the vehicles before the collision or anyone with relevant dashcam footage can contact officers from the Staffordshire and West Midlands Serious Collision Investigation Unit by messaging Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 33 of 23 January or calling 101.
