Two men have been jailed for a burglary where watches and jewellery worth £5,000 were stolen in Stoke-on-Trent.

Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard that Derrick Cotton and Daniel Sims committed a burglary in Foxley Lane, Milton, on 31 March.

Cotton, aged 37, of Kennermount Road, Abbey Hulton, pleaded guilty to the burglary and another burglary in Kennermount Road. He was sentenced to four years eight months.

Sims, also aged 37, of no fixed address, was found guilty of the Milton burglary and jailed for three years.

Twenty one watches worth around £5,000 and a gold bracelet, ring and chains were also taken.

Detective Chief Inspector Rob Taylor, of Staffordshire Police, said: "We're glad Cotton and Sims have been sentenced for this burglary and we will continue to target offenders who believe they can prey on houses and commercial premises across the county."

The property was recovered by police.

They were sentenced on 12 September.
