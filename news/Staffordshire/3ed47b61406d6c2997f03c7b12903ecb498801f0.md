Officers are appealing for information on the whereabouts of two mountain bikes and a motocross bike stolen from a garage in Norton Canes, Cannock, on Sunday (21 March).

The high-value raid took place at about 4.40pm in Broadoaks Close where the raiders have ripped the garage door off.

A red car, believed to be a Ford Focus, was seen acting suspiciously in the street at the time and one of the men believed to be involved was described by witnesses as wearing a black hoody, blue jeans, and white surgical face mask.

The three bikes taken from the garage were a Honda CRF 250 motocross bike, a Cube Stereo e-bicycle and a Saracen Aerial bicycle as seen in these photographs.

Anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious at the time, has any CCTV footage, or is offered bikes matching these images for sale, should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 539 of 21 March, or alternatively contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
