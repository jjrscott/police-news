A man from South Wales has been jailed after being found guilty of historical sex offences against a child in Stafford.

57-year-old Lee Whyman, of Pen-Y-Graig Terrace in Pontypool, was sentenced to 17 and a half years at Stafford Crown Court on Friday (21 February) after being convicted of sexual abuse and rape of a child aged between nine and 13 years old.

The offences date back to the 1990s when Whyman was in his 30s.

Detective Inspector Neil Poultney, of CID South, said: "It takes a great deal of courage to come forward and report sexual abuse as a child and we must commend the bravery of the victim in this case.

"These were despicable offences committed against a young and vulnerable child. We will always do whatever it takes to bring offenders to justice, while ensuring victims and their families are offered the support they need."

Anyone who has suffered sexual abuse, or suspects others may be subject to sexual abuse, is urged to contact Staffordshire Police on 101.

Alternatively, the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through www.crimestoppers-uk.org
