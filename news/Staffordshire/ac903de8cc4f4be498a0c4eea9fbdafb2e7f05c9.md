We are appealing for information over two carjackings that took place near to Cannock this week.

The first occurred between 2.15pm and 2.20pm on Monday (23 November) when a car pulled into a layby just off Lime Lane and Wyrley Lane. Another vehicle pulled up in front of the victim's and three-to-four masked offenders exited before attacking the victim, dragging them out of their vehicle into a bush and driving off in their car.

The second occurred on Wednesday (25 November) at the same place, between 6.50pm and 7pm. This time, a car pulled up and up to six offenders got out, two carrying baseball bats. Again they attacked the victim and pulled them out of their car.

Police believe that the offenders operate in a group of between four and six. The offenders were wearing balaclavas during the incidents.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 701 of 25 November, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
