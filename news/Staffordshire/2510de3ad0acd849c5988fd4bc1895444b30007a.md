Police officers are continuing their investigations after discovering around 350 plants at a cannabis factory in the Staffordshire Moorlands.

Officers uncovered the set-up at a property on Cheadle Road in Cheddleton yesterday morning.

And the force has thanked the community for raising concerns over suspicious activity in the area which led to the operation being shut down.

Officers with Moorlands Neighbourhood Policing Team found the plants growing in various rooms where the electricity to the residential property had also been bypassed.

The property has since been emptied and made safe.

PC Mark Garsden, of Moorlands NPT, said: "These sorts of incidents are rare in the Staffordshire Moorlands and we are pleased to have shut down this operation.

"These set-ups are often dangerous and therefore making the property safe and stopping these drugs from going out onto the streets is a positive result.

"We would also like to thank the local community for raising their concerns over suspicious activity in the area and would urge them to continue sharing any issues they have to allow us to act on them."
