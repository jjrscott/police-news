Two new police dogs are settling into their roles as they embark on their first police training course.

PD Vixen and PD Titus are the latest recruits at Staffordshire Police and are undergoing a 13-week training course with their handlers to join the force's Dog Unit.

PD Vixen is a 14-month-old Dutch Herder and working alongside PC Jones, who joined the team in March. He previously served as a response officer in Cannock before applying to be a Dog Handler at the start of the year.

The duo are now in week ten of the course, alongside PD Titus - a 20-month-old German Shepherd, and experienced handler PC Tatton.

During the course, led by Senior Instructor PC Holding, the PDs learn how to chase and detain offenders, track suspects and find missing people, search buildings and open areas, search for property and general agility and obedience.

If they successfully complete the course, they will join the rest of our four-legged colleagues in sniffing out offenders across Staffordshire.

PC Jones said: "Although I enjoyed working on response, I have always wanted to be a dog handler so to now be in training, especially with a dog like Vixen, is a brilliant experience.

"She has settled right in both at home and at work, and is taking everything in her stride. Our bond is growing every day.

"Both PD Vixen and PD Titus are making great progress and although the course is intensive, it's been incredibly rewarding so far."
