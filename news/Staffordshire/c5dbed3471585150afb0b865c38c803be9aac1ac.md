Detectives have made a further arrest in connection with a planned rave in Staffordshire.

A 20-year-old Rugeley man was arrested today as an operation to crack down on illegal raves continues.

He was arrested on suspicion of conspiring to cause a public nuisance and is currently in custody. The arrest is in connection with a planned rave near Rugeley in June.

Chief Superintendent Carl Ratcliffe, Head of Contact and Response at Staffordshire Police, is leading the county-wide operation.

Officers have already made 13 arrests in connection with a planned rave near Chasewater and five more arrests were made in relation to a planned rave near Rugeley, both last month. On the weekend of June 13 a rave was stopped near Lichfield where 1,000 people had attended.

Chief Supt Ratcliffe said: "The operation continues and we will make further arrests if necessary. I understand that lockdown is being eased but these unlawful gatherings cannot take place. We have a continuing, dedicated policing operation in place, with a much higher police presence in potential hot spot areas."

"Please get in touch if you have information about gatherings. We appreciate the help we've already been given."

If you suspect a rave/illegal gathering is being set up or there is suspicious activity, contact Staffordshire Police via Facebook or Twitter, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. The information available using @what3words or @ordnancesurvey will help officers to pinpoint the location.
