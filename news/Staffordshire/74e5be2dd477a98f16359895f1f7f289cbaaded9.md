Three arrests were made this lunchtime (11 Feb) as officers stopped a car in Burton and seized baseball bats and class A drugs.

Entry had to be forced into a silver Vauxhall Astra after it was stopped at noon in Trent Street, Burton.

Class A drugs, phones and two baseball bats were seized.

Two men, aged 22 and 23, and a 16-year-old girl, all from Birmingham, were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs.

They remain in custody.
