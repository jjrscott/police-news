Detectives are investigating following a house fire in Meir.

We received a call at about 10.15pm last night (Sunday 20 December) to reports of a disturbance at a property in Sandon Road.

Officers arrived to find the occupants outside the property.

An ambulance attended to see to the occupants and Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service attended to tackle the fire.

Officers arrested a 39-year-old man, from Stoke-on-Trent, nearby on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life and use of violence to gain entry to a property.

A 34-year-old man, from Stoke-on-Trent, was arrested a short time later on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life, use of violence to secure entry to a property, theft from a dwelling and assault by beating.

Both men remain in custody.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 682 of 20 December, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
