A Stoke-on-Trent taxi driver has today been found guilty of sexually assaulting a woman passenger.

Najibullah Hakani, aged 27, was found guilty of assaulting the woman after stopping off during a journey between Crewe and Audley in 2018.

He was convicted today (15 February) at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court.

The court heard that Hakani's passenger - a woman in her 20s - had booked a taxi to take her from her home address in Crewe to a friend's house in Audley on 16 April 2018.

She was travelling with her young son.

He started to make lewd comments and asked personal questions, before pulling over just off the A500 near to fields and asking her to get in the front of the cab.

She said she was frightened and did as she was told. Hakani put his hand inside her top and then grabbed her hand and placed it on his groin.

She went into her friend's house and they saw she was shaking and upset. She then reported the incident to police.

A DNA sample from clothing provided a link to Hakani.

Hakani, of XX, will be sentenced on 8 March. He was found guilty of one count of sexual assault and not guilty of a second count.

Detective Inspector Zoe Kelsall, of Staffordshire Police, said: "We're thankful the victim had the courage to come forward and tell us what happened.

"This was a frightening experience for her as she was vulnerable and worried about her own safety and that of her child."

 Anyone who has suffered sexual abuse, or suspects others may be subject to sexual abuse, is urged to contact Staffordshire Police on 101.
