Detectives have released CCTV images of two men they want to speak to in connection with an armed robbery last week.

Two men entered Co-op on High Street in Wolstanton, Newcastle-under-Lyme, at around 8.15pm on 16 January and threatened a member of staff with an axe.

Thankfully, no one was injured but the pair made off with a quantity of cash and cigarettes and ran off towards the direction of Keelings Street.

Detective Constable David Stubbs, from force CID, said: "This was a particularly distressing incident for the member of staff who was simply doing her job. She was threatened with the axe before the pair raided behind the counter.

"We're determined to bring the offenders to justice and we would like to hear from anyone who has any information or anyone that may have seen the men in the CCTV images to get in touch as they could have information that may be able to assist with our investigation.

"Anyone that may have seen anyone or any vehicles acting suspiciously before or immeditately after the robbery are also asked to get in touch.

"Anyone with information can call 101 quoting incident number 602 of 16 January, direct message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter or email david.stubbs@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk.

"Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
