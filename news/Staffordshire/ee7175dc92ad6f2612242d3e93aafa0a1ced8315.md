A senior detective is still hopeful that fresh evidence could come to light to help him catch the killer of Stoke-on-Trent taxi driver Steven Johnson.

Unsolved murder cases are extremely rare in Staffordshire, but three decades have now passed since Steven was found in a lane at Mow Cop on 22 December 1990.

His attacker had left him with knife wounds to his throat.

The case remains open and is reviewed subject to new information to identify any investigative opportunities.

Detective Chief Inspector Jason Everett, of Staffordshire Police's Major Investigations Department, said any new information that came to light would be considered.

"We still believe the murderer had connections locally and it is possible that, even after all this time, someone was told something or remembers something.

"We're disappointed that we haven't been able to find the person responsible for Steven's murder and deliver justice for Steven's family.

DCI Everett has recently spoken to Steven's mother, who appealed for privacy.

"We cannot change what happened to Steven but we do this job to make a difference for victims' families and bring offenders to justice.

"It will always be a difficult time for Steven's family. He was a mild-mannered man who was much-loved by his family and friends."

Steven, 25, was found by dog walkers, a short distance from his taxi in a remote farm track off Castle Road on 22 December 1990.

An arrest was made in 2014 following new information received but a man from the local area was later released without further action.
