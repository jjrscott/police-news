 * Silver solar-powered Citizen watch with black face;
 * Metal grey RAF G-Shock watch with black face;

 * Silver bracelet in a linked chain design with a heart charm attached to it.

Officers are continuing their investigation into the burglary and are urging anyone who may have witnessed anything suspicious in the area - or who has been offered any of the items listed - to contact the force.
