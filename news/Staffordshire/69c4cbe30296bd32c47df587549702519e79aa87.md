The family of a woman found dead at her home in Tunstall Road, Knypersley, on Sunday, have paid tribute to her, as detectives appeal for dash cam footage of a car.

This follows the formal identification of 71-year-old Ann Wendy Morse, known as Wendy.

Wendy's family have said: "We are devastated at the loss of our mum, who was a very bubbly person and full of character, who will be sorely missed by her children and grandchildren. We would appeal to any member of the public with any information, however small, to contact Staffordshire Police in connection with the death of our mum."

Detectives are appealing for dash cam footage from vehicles between Biddulph to Sneyd Green, via Bemersley Road and Norton, from midday until 3pm on Thursday 19 March. They are particularly interested in any footage of a green Honda Civic, with registration plate OK62 AMS.

A post mortem has taken place but further tests are required.
