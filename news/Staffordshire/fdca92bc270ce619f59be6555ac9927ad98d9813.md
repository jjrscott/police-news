Officers are appealing for witnesses following a fatal road traffic collision in the early hours of this morning (4 January).

The collision happened at around 2am on the eastbound A5 Wall bypass, near Muckley Corner in Lichfield. A report was received of a white Clio that had collided with a HGV in a layby near to Wall island.

Sadly, a 21-year-old man from Walsall, was pronounced dead at the scene and specialist officers are supporting his family at this difficult time.

An investigation is underway and officers from the Staffordshire and West Midlands Serious Collision Investigation Unit are appealing for any witnesses that may have seen the white Clio prior to the collision to come forward.

Officers are also keen to hear from anyone who may have any dash-cam footage or any other information that may assist with the investigation.

Anyone with information is asked to email ciu@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk, call 101 quoting incident number 55 of 4 January or direct message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter.
