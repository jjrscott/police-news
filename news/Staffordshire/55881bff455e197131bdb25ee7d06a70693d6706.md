Detectives investigating the death of a man in Stoke-on-Trent have today named him as Matthew Dale, aged 23, from Dresden.

Officers were initially called to Lightwood Road in Longton shortly after midnight yesterday (Monday 5 October) by colleagues at West Midlands Ambulance following reports of a stabbing. Sadly Matthew died on the way to hospital.

Specially-trained officers are supporting Matthew's family at this difficult time.

A post mortem has taken place but further tests are required.

A 16-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, from Stoke-on-Trent, has been charged with murder. He will appear before magistrates at the North Staffordshire Justice Centre tomorrow morning (Wednesday 7 October).
