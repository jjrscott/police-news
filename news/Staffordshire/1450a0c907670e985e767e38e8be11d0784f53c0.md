A serving Staffordshire Police officer has been sentenced after he targeted a vulnerable victim of crime on social media.

PC Jarrett Kinson, 36, a response officer based in Burton, attended Birmingham Crown Court today (4 November) having been convicted of corruption through abuse of his authority of the office of constable.

He was handed an eight month custodial sentence.

PC Kinson had pleaded guilty to the offence at an earlier hearing.

He admitted contacting and sending an explicit image on social media to a vulnerable woman after he attended a report of domestic abuse in his role as a police officer.

The interaction and contact took place between March and July 2018.

Deputy Chief Constable Nick Baker, of Staffordshire Police, said: "Abuse of position for sexual gain by police officers or staff in any guise is never acceptable as it causes harm or distress to the very people we should be protecting and keeping safe."

He remains suspended from his role with Staffordshire Police and will face internal disciplinary proceedings.
