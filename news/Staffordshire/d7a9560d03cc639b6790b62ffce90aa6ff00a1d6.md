A Kidsgrove man has been jailed for four years eight months for sexually assaulting two young girls in the 1980s.

Mark Longshaw, aged 63, of Diamond Avenue, was jailed at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court yesterday (August 6) after admitting four counts of indecent assault.

The court heard that Longshaw's victims were aged seven and ten when they were assaulted. The offences took place in the early 1980s in the Stoke-on-Trent area and came to light when one of Longshaw's victims approached police.

Detective Constable Naomi Kinnersley, of Staffordshire Police, said: ""I would like to take this opportunity to praise the victims who not only had the bravery to come forward but also had the confidence in the police that what they said to officers would be listened to.

"The offending went back almost forty years but despite the passage of time we investigated the crimes and took action. Victims of sexual offences should come forward, no matter how long the passage of time, and tell police what happened. They will be listened to."

Anyone who has suffered sexual abuse, or suspects others may be subject to sexual abuse, is urged to contact Staffordshire Police on 101.
