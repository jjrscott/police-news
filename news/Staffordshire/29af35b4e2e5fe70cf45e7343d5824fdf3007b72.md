Detectives have released CCTV footage of an armed robbery at a shop which saw a member of staff threatened with an axe.

Two people entered Co-op on High Street in Wolstanton, Newcastle-under-Lyme, at around 8.15pm on 16 January.

Thankfully, no one was injured but the pair made off with a quantity of cash and cigarettes.

Detective Constable David Stubbs, from force CID, said: "This was a particularly distressing incident for the member of staff that was simply doing her job. She was threatened with the axe before the pair raided behind the counter.

"We're determined to bring the offenders to justice and we would like to hear from anyone who has any information or anyone that may recognise those in the CCTV footage or may have seen them before or after the robbery to get in touch as they could have information that may be able to assist with our investigation.

"Anyone that may have seen anyone or any vehicles acting suspiciously before or after the robbery are also asked to get in touch.

"Anyone with information can call 101 quoting incident number 602 of 16 January, direct message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter or email david.stubbs@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk.

"Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
