Officers have shut down a cannabis factory in Stoke-on-Trent - after concerns were raised over suspicious activity at the property.

Staffordshire Police's Neighbourhood Tasking Team (NTT) discovered the operation in Normacot on Wednesday where a number of plants were seized.

Electricity had been bypassed at the property on Hamilton Road where officers seized 81 plants.

Inspector Scott Robson, of the NTT, said: "This came about as a direct result of concerns being raised in the community and we are pleased to have stopped this operation.

"Anyone who does have concerns over drug misuse in their community should contact the force and allow our officers to deal with it."

No arrests have yet been made over the cannabis factory in Normacot and enquiries are ongoing.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 0430 of March 21, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
