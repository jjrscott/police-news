Officers are now in a position to name the man killed in a fatal collision on the A5 between Stretton and Gailey yesterday morning (Tuesday 10 November).

59-year-old Paul Atkins from Essington, Wolverhampton was driving a silver Peugeot 308 towards Telford shortly before midday when he was involved in a collision with a white coloured cement mixer travelling in the opposite direction.

Sergeant Rich Moors from the Staffordshire and West Midlands Serious Collision Investigation Unit said: "I'm keen to hear from anyone who saw the vehicles before the collision or the incident itself.

"The road was quite busy with traffic at the time and it is possible there are witnesses who are yet to get in touch. I'm also looking to trace any relations of Paul as his direct family passed away some years ago."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 225 of 10 November, call 101, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or alternatively email ciu@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk.
