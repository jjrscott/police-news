A teenager was left with cuts to his head following a robbery in Burslem on Tuesday night (Sept 15).

Detectives are appealing for information after the victim was struck over the head and left needing hospital treatment, after the attack in Vale Fields near Port Vale FC at around 8pm.

He was jogging around the field when he was assaulted by up to six males wearing dark clothing. They stole his coat and keys, although he managed to run away towards Dimensions leisure centre on Scotia Road.

Anyone with information is urged to contact us on social media or 101 referring to incident 281 of 16 September.

Detective Inspector Scott McGrath, of Staffordshire Police, said: "This was a serious and unprovoked assault. We need to speak to anyone who may have been a witness."
