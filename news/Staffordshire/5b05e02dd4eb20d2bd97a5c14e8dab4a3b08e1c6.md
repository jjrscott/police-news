Two Newcastle men have been jailed after pleading guilty to firearms offences.

Jake William George Pettifer, 22, of Birch House Road, Chesterton, was sentenced to two and a half years' imprisonment today (Tuesday 21 January) at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court after admitting possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, putting a person in fear of violence by harassment and making use of an imitation firearm with intent to prevent his arrest.

Calum David Weaver, 26, of Applecroft, Chesterton, was sentenced to 16 months' imprisonment at the same court after pleading guilty to making use of an imitation firearm with intent to prevent his arrest. He was found not guilty of possession of an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence at earlier hearing in December.

Officers were called to the Chesterton area following a domestic-related incident last September. As officers attempted to arrest both men they saw that Pettifer was holding a handgun. It was only later that it was identified as an imitation gun. Pettifer then pointed the gun at the officers threatening them. Weaver fired the gun into the air. Armed officers arrived and both men were arrested.

DC Dave Turner, from CID, said: "Despite being unarmed, the officers acted quickly and bravely to negotiate with Pettifer and Weaver.

"There is no doubt that both officers had been impacted by the threat made with what they believed to be a real firearm."
