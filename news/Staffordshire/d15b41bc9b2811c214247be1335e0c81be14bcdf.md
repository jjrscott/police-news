Three men have been arrested on suspicion of robbery after a postman was assaulted in Great Wyrley yesterday morning (24 Oct).

The postman was in the Tower View Road/Poplar Road area of Landywood when he was pushed to the floor and a trolley of mail stolen at around 1130am.

Shortly afterwards three men were arrested in connection with the incident and remain in custody.

A 37-year-old man from Smethwick, a 30-year-old man from West Bromwich, and a 17-year-old from Walsall were arrested on suspicion of robbery and further suspected theft offences.

Inspector Mat Walker, of Staffordshire Police, said: "We want to thank the local community for their help and support which has been invaluable. We will provide updates as the investigation continues."

The postman was shaken up, but not believed to be injured.
