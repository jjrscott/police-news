A Tamworth man has been found guilty of causing the death of a 90-year-old in 2018 by careless driving at Stafford Crown Court today.

Roger Cope, aged 50, of Laburnum Close, Kingsbury, was found guilty of causing the death of Isaac Wright on 21 December 2018 by careless driving and will be sentenced on 10 March at Birmingham Crown Court. He will also be sentenced for perverting the course of justice which he pleaded guilty to in December 2019.

Cope, who was driving his Citroen Picasso, struck Mr Wright at around 10.45pm on Watling Street, near to the junction with Dosthill Road and Tamworth Road, as he was crossing the road. Cope then drove away from the scene.
