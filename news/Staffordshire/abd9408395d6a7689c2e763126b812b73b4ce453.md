Detectives are continuing to investigate a robbery at Leek United Building Society in Leek town centre.

The robbery, on St Edward Street, took place on Thursday (2 January) just before 1pm, when a man entered the building society and stole a quantity of cash.

DC Amanda Whitfield, from CID, said: "It is now believed that the man, described as white, 6ft tall with a slim build, walked along Strangman Street in the town before entering the building society. He then ran back along the same street after the robbery. I am keen to speak to anyone with dashcam footage of the area at around 1pm.

He was wearing a black baseball cap with a white motif, a black top with a small white motif on the left chest, a black waterproof coat with a hood, black trousers with a small motif on the left top pocket, black trainers and black skiing gloves. He used a black scarf with a red section at the front to cover his face.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 257 of 2 January, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111
