Detectives investigating a robbery in Hanley yesterday afternoon (22 June) are appealing for witnesses at the scene to come forward.

Police were called at 4.15pm to an area of Central Forest Park near Union Street after a man in his 60s was robbed at knifepoint.

Detective Inspector Lucy Maskew said: "Our enquiries are continuing this afternoon and I'd like to hear from anyone who was in the park between 3.45pm and 4.15pm yesterday and may be able to assist with our investigation.

"Please get in touch if you witnessed any suspicious behaviour in the area beforehand or saw the attack take place."

A man arrested in connection with the robbery remains in custody at this time. A second man has been released with no further action.

Anyone with any information is urged to contact Staffordshire Police as soon as possible on 101 or via Facebook or Twitter referring to incident number 413 of 22 June.
