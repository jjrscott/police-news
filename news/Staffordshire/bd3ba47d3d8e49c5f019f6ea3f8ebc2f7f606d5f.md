Police teams in parts of Staffordshire are working with local businesses in a bid to make our high streets safer for shoppers in the run up to Christmas.

Officers in Cannock, Rugeley and Hednesford have been carrying out high visual foot patrols as part of Operation Hexagon - which sees them work with shopkeepers and CCTV operators to pinpoint anyone intent on pickpocketing or shoplifting during the festive period.

Cannock Deputy Commander Mark Burslem: "It's an impactive crime. People want to go out and shop with the peace of mind that they're not going to be a victim of crime.

"People work hard for that money, they want to spend it on the families - anything we can do to make sure that happens, we'll look to help.

"To those who are thinking of targeting vulnerable people - don't do it. It's not worth spending time in prison for the sake of stealing someone's money."

Operation Hexagon will continue towards Christmas with the advice being to keep purses and wallets "safe and secure" when out and about.
