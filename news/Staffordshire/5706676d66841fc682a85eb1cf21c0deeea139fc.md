Police carried out simultaneous warrants in Tunstall where officers seized drugs, weapons, and cash.

Officers targeted four properties in response to both concerns raised from the public and intelligence gathered by the force.

Now an investigation is ongoing following the warrants which saw officers from both Stoke-on-Trent North and Stoke-on-Trent South Neighbourhood Policing Teams, work alongside the roads policing unit, dog handlers, and the neighbourhood tasking team.

During the operation on Thursday morning (14 January) officers seized cannabis, cash, phones, an air rifle and a BB gun. A 22-year-old man, from Stoke-on-Trent, was voluntary interviewed and enquiries continue.

Sergeant Charlie Emmett, of Stoke-on-Trent North Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "This was an intelligence-led operation and we thank the public for raising their concerns with us. Our investigations are ongoing following these warrants.

"We will continue to respond to local issues and work closely with our communities."
