A dispersal order has been put in place in Wolstanton and patrols are being stepped up as we look to clamp down on reports of anti-social behaviour and disorder.

We attended Moreton Parade at 8pm last night to a report of disorder.

An order has been authorised and will be in place until 8pm tomorrow night (August 6), when it will be reviewed.

This means anyone failing to comply with officers asking them to leave the area, or handover items likely to cause anti-social behaviour, during this period could be arrested.

Chief Inspector Phil Duffy, area commander for Newcastle Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We are aware of a few incidents of anti-social behaviour and as a result we had already increased our patrols in that vicinity. I am grateful to the community in that area who are assisting us with our enquiries and together with our partner agencies we will be using all available opportunities to prevent such occurrences. We want to reassure the community we will not tolerate disorder and will make arrests and put offenders before the courts if necessary."
