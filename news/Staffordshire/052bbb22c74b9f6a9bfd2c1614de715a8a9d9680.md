Police are warning fuel station staff of hoax callers attemping to steal tobacco products.

The warning comes after officers have seen a trend of offences taking place across the country where garage forecourt staff are being contacted by someone purporting to be a senior manager.

The staff are asked to bag up various tobacco products and put them in a clear bag and hand to a taxi or delivery van, which will be sent to the location to collect. Often the reason given is that other garages are in urgent need of stock so it is being redistributed. Whilst tobacco is often the focus, drinks, phone top-ups and even cash have been requested.

If any such calls are received please inform the police keeping a log of phones numbers used by the offenders.

Anyone with information should call 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
