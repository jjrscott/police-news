Officers have arrested two men over suspected drugs offences.

A Mini Cooper VRM was stopped in Uttoxeter at about 6.30pm on Monday (9 November) and the driver, aged 46, from near Cheadle, provided a positive drug swipe and was arrested for driving under the influence of drugs. He has been released under investigation.

Then, at a nearby address, a 26-year-old from Uttoxeter was arrested for being concerned in the supply of cocaine after he was found in possession of the drug. Upon searching another vehicle nearby, more cocaine was found. He remains in custody.
