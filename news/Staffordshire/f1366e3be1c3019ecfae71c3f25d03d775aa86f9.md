HGV drivers making their way through Staffordshire are being urged to be alert after a rise in freight crime across the county.

In recent weeks we have seen an increase in the number of lorries and HGVs being targeted for their contents whilst parked up within our force area - thousands of pounds worth of televisions were stolen in one incident in Audley in north Staffordshire.

In response, we have deployed specialist resources and are working in partnership with the Central Motorway Police Group (CMPG), the National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service and the Road Haulage Association to increase patrols and target those involved.

Chief Inspector Giles Parsons, commander of Stafford Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We fully appreciate the impact this type of crime has on drivers, haulage companies and businesses as a whole.

"We are fully committed to taking necessary and pro-active measures to ensure we catch those responsible - deterring them from committing further crime.

"It's important you listen to the advice and take the necessary precautions when parking up within our county."

We ask drivers of lorries and other HGVs to take note of the following advice:

When returning to your lorry, check for signs of any interference

• Plan your journey - make sure you know where you are going to park for any overnight rest breaks
• If possible, avoid laybys and other insecure parking locations
• Always secure your lorry if left unattended
• Lock trailer doors whilst driving
• Park with the trailer doors close to another vehicle or wall
• Ensure trailer doors are closed, whether loaded or not
• Lock your cab and take the keys when loading or unloading
• Avoid taking the same routes or stops for breaks - a recognisable pattern makes you an easier target for criminals
• Arrange a procedure with your company for authorising any changes to delivery destination or method of unloading
• When returning to your lorry, check for signs of any interference.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
