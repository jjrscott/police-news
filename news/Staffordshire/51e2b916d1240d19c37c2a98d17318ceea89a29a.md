Officers are appealing for witnesses after a man suffered life-threatening injuries in collision with a tree on the A50.

Police were called at around 6.50pm to the A50 junction with the A552 in Uttoxeter, to reports of a BMW car being in collision with a tree.

The driver, a male in his 20s, sustained significant spinal, liver and kidney injuries in the collision.

He was taken to Royal Stoke Hospital for critical care treatment where he remains in a stable condition.

Collision Investigation Officer Matthew Lovatt said: "I would like to appeal to anyone who saw what happened who may have dashcam footage of the area at the time of the collision to get in touch with police while our inquiries continue."

Anyone with information is asked to contact the force on 101 quoting incident number 681 of 1 November.
