We are appealing for information after a man walking in fields near Stafford was attacked by a pit bull terrier.

The man suffered leg injuries and his fox terrier dog required emergency surgery.

The man was walking in fields near to the lake behind the new Marston Grange housing development off Beaconside at around 8pm on May 24.

A pit bull terrier, which was with a man who was fishing at the lake, attacked the man leaving him with lower leg injuries and then attacked a fox terrier dog.

The dog owner is described as a white male, 6ft tall, wearing dark clothing and believed to have a local accent. He is believed to have left in a silver Vauxhall Corsa.

The dog is a brindle-coloured pit bull terrier type.

Anyone with information is urged to contact Staffordshire Police via social media or on 101 referring to incident 736 of 24 May.

PC Owain Pugh said "We'd urge anyone who knows the owner of this dog to please come forward. The victim suffered injuries from the bite in what was a frightening incident for him."

"We need to speak to the man pictured in connection with this incident."
