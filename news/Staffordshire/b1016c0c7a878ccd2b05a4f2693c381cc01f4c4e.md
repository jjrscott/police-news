Updated News Post

Police have cordoned off a road in Stoke-on-Trent this evening following the death of woman, possibly involving hazardous materials.

Emergency Services were called to a house in Eaton Street, Northwood at 5.45pm today (Friday).

The body of a woman was found inside the address. The death is being treated as unexplained at this stage and a post mortem will take place.

The area has been cordoned off and some residents in neighbouring properties have been evacuated as a precautionary measure whilst crews from Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service assess the scene.

Five emergency responders have been taken to hospital for precautionary checks for possible effects of the suspected materials.

We would like to inform residents that the junction of Mynors Street and Eaton Street is closed while emergency services work to make the area safe.

**Update 10 Feb:**

Detectives continue to treat the death as unexplained, however it is not believed to be suspicious.

Formal ID will take place in due course and a report is being prepared for HM Coroner.

All emergency service staff were discharged from hospital a short time later and no further treatment is required.

Officers would like to thank local residents for their patience and understanding as they worked alongside colleagues from Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service to ensure that the area was safe.
