A Shelton man has been sentenced to more than five years in prison for possessing and intent to supply cocaine and heroin.

Shako Khalid, of Ashford Street, was found guilty at Stafford Crown Court of two counts of possession with intent to sell class A drugs.

The 22-year-old was arrested on March 4 after calling the police to report a man was banging on his door and threatening him. When they arrived Khalid handed them a large quantity of drugs and said he had been asked to take care of them. He claimed he did not know what was in the packages, a court heard.

His address was searched and officers found a check list with references to both small and large deals of crack cocaine and heroin which were seized along with a mobile phone belonging to Khalid which showed evidence of the offences. In total Â£2,140 worth of class A drugs were found at the home.

Khalid was sentenced on September 3 to five and a half years for each of the counts of possession with intent to sell class A drugs to be served concurrently.
