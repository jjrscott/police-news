The inquest into the deaths of four children who died in a house fire in Stafford is to be adjourned until the New Year.

The inquest into the deaths of Riley John Holt, aged 8, Keegan Jonathan Unitt, aged 6, Tilly Rose Unitt, aged 4, and Olly Unitt aged 3, had been set for December 19.

It has now been provisionally scheduled to take place on 20 February 2020.

Senior investigating officer, Detective Inspector Alan Lyford, said: "This has been a thorough and complex investigation involving our colleagues from Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service and other agencies.

"We are now working to bring this investigation to a conclusion and it has been necessary to adjourn the inquest before we can provide an update in the New Year.

"We appreciate this has been a lengthy process and that this tragic case has deeply affected the local community. We would again like to thank the community for their patience and support."

A 25-year-old woman and a 29-year-old man arrested on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence following the fire have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
