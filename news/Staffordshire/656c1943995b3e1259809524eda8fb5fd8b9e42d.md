A team of specialist problem solvers, set up in the last few months by Staffordshire Police, is advising officers and staff in how to deal with some of the crimes and vulnerability issues arising during the current Coronavirus lock-down.

The Early Intervention and Prevention Unit (EIPU) - the first of its type in the country - gives specialist advice and guidance on different areas of vulnerability, such as domestic abuse, child exploitation, mental health, stalking and harassment, hate crime and drugs and alcohol.

The team helps to recognise and identify emerging trends and potential shift in crime patterns, such as online offences, which may increase over the next weeks and months.

Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Simon Tweats said: "Staffordshire Police and our partner agencies are still working to protect the public. The safety of all the residents of Staffordshire still is and will remain our number one priority."

"You can call the police on 101 or if an emergency please dial 999. We are here to assist you and keep you safe. If you do not want to contact the police, there are support agencies available to you online or on the phone."
