A man and a woman have been arrested on suspicion of attempted child abduction following in incident in Stafford.

Officers were called at 3.45pm on Wednesday afternoon to reports that a man and a woman in a car had approached an 11-year-old girl and a six-year-old boy on Brook Glen Road in Stafford.

A 56-year-old man and a 60-year-old woman, both of Stafford, have both been bailed with strict conditions whilst the investigation is ongoing.

Chief Inspector Giles Parsons, commander of Stafford Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We are also aware of other reports circulating on social media in relation to numerous suspicious incidents around Stafford town centre involving children, all of these incidents are being investigated by our Child Protection and Exploitation Team.

"At this time, officers are satisfied that the incident on Brook Glen Road is an isolated case and not linked to previous suspicious incidents in the town. Investigations into the other reports around the town centre are ongoing."

"High visibility patrols will continue to reassure the community regarding this incident."
