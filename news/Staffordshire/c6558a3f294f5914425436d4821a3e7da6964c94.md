Young people taking part in the Prince's Trust Cannock Team 7 have been working on a community project at Hayes Green Community Centre in Heath Hayes

Team is an activity of Safer Communities CIC (Community Interest Company) which operates in Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent. CIC works with partners: Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service, Ground Work West Midlands and Avison Young to help make the county's communities safer.

To fund their project they took a stall at Cannock Market where they ran a "Guess the Name of the Teddy Bear" competition, a sponsored cycle, a bake sale and "Blind Date with a Book". Despite the cold weather, their efforts raised just under Â£80.

The team decided to spend their two weeks pressure washing the driveway, cleaning and repairing fences, weeding and clearing the path, as well as repainting the fences to improve the look of the centre. They also developed a Fairy Garden in an unused part of the garden which had become overgrown, and transformed the area into a safe and child friendly haven where children can explore and develop. The team also used their upcycling skills to add a bug hotel and create a sensory element to the garden for children with additional needs.
