Officers have made arrests and a dispersal order has been put in place following reports of a robbery and disorder in Kidsgrove this afternoon (27 November).

We were called to Clough Hall Park at around 3pm to reports a man had been assaulted by youths. The man has been taken to hospital.

Officers made a search of the area and arrested suspects.

A 16-year-old boy from the Tamworth area and a 16 year old boy from Newcastle area have been arrested on suspicion of robbery at Clough Hall Park.

A 19-year-old was arrested on suspicion of assault, criminal damage and resisting arrest.

Enquiries are still ongoing and officers are investigating whether other incidents in the Kidsgrove area and Newcastle College this afternoon are connected.

Chief Inspector Clair Langley, of Newcastle Neighbourhood Policing Team, has authorised a dispersal order for 48 hours for Clough Hall Park.

"I want to reassure the local community we have responded swiftly, made arrests and put an order in place to ensure we tackle this unacceptable anti-social behaviour and incidents of violence."

Anyone with information is asked to call 101, direct message us on Facebook or Twitter or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting incident number 432 of 27 November.
