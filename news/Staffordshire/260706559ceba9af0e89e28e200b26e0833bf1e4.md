A man who died in a road traffic collision in Meir has been named.

Police were called at 4.05am on Tuesday morning (03 November) to a report of a road traffic collision involving a Audi A4 on Sandon Road near the junction with Martindale Close.

Despite the efforts of emergency service staff, a passenger was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. He has now been named as 65-year-old Paul Hammersley from Stoke-on-Trent.

Specialist officers are supporting his family and have asked that their privacy is respected at this difficult time.
