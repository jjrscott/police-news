Two men face sizable jail terms after officers conducted a drugs raid at a flat in Stoke-on-Trent.

Iko Anderson and Reumaine Wilson face more than eight years behind bars between them after positive policing work in October last year.

The raid saw officers seize a number of Class A drugs, cash, drugs paraphernalia, bladed weapons and mobile phones.

It's believed the drugs found were worth more than Â£2000.

Anderson, Wilson and a third man - 18-year-old Tyler Murphy - pleaded guilty to two charges of possession of a Class A drug with intent to supply.

23-year-old Anderson, of Liverpool Road, Stoke was sentenced to five years and seven months in jail with 23-year-old Reumaine Wilson, of Flax Street, Stoke, jailed for 32 months.

Murphy, of Durber Close, Stoke was handed a two year suspended sentence. He was instructed to undertake 100 hours of unpaid work and six months of drug rehabilitation.

Sergeant Marc Proctor from the force's Stoke South Neighbourhood Policing Team said: "We're really pleased with the police work that went into securing hefty sentences for both Wilson and Anderson.

"We acted quickly to apprehend the pair after we'd become aware of potential drug dealing in the area around Richmond Street in Stoke and great credit must go to the officers involved.

"We're grateful to the courts for their support in imposing these sentences on Anderson and Wilson and we hope this acts as a deterrent for anyone looking to produce, sell or take drugs in Staffordshire."
