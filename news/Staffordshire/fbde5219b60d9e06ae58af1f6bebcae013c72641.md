Officers are reminding people to take care of their registered firearms after a shotgun was stolen from a pick-up truck on the Staffordshire-Shropshire border.

A farmer reported that the shotgun - a single-barrelled model - was taken from the rear footwell of his truck on his farm some time between lunch time yesterday (Thursday March 4) and 11.20am today (Friday 5 March).

The shotgun was licensed, there was no ammunition in the vehicle and it wasn't loaded.

DC Martin Smith, of Staffordshire Police's Southern CID team, said: "We urge everyone to always take care of any licenced firearms they own.

"You should always keep what can be dangerous weapons locked somewhere secure and where you know they are safe.

"Incidents like this will always cause concern but we are searching for the shotgun that was taken and will do everything we can to keep our communities safe."
