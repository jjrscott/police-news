A teenager from Burton has been jailed for two years after he was caught with cannabis and cash after running from police officers.

Hassan Amer, 19, was jailed on Friday (Dec 11) at Stafford Crown Court after admitting two counts of possession with intent to supply cannabis in Burton.

The court heard that during the afternoon of 9 September Amer was stopped and searched in Blakeholme Court, Burton, and cannabis, cash and phones recovered.

On 2 January this year further cash and cannabis was seized from Amer's address in Derby Road, Burton.

Detective Inspector Tim Boulton, of Staffordshire Police, said: "We're glad Amer has been sentenced after good detective work led to this stop and a search and the confiscation of drugs and cash."
