Detectives are seeking witnesses to a stabbing in Tamworth last night (13 January) that left the victim with a deep wound in his back that thankfully is not life-changing.

We received a call at about 9.20pm from West Midlands Police asking us to attend Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield after a man from the Tamworth area had been transferred there with a stab wound to his lower back.

The victim, in his 20s, had previously presented himself at the Robert Peel Medical Centre in Tamworth at about 7.15pm before being transferred. The attack is believed to have happened one-to-two hours before he arrived.

It was determined that prior to arriving at the medical centre the victim had walked across the grassland area between Glascote Heath and Belgrave having left a friend's house with other friends in Glascote Heath.

He left his friends to go over the A5 and Belgrave Lake via a footbridge, and after exiting the steps men not known to him approached from behind and stabbed him. Thankfully his injuries were not life-changing or life-threatening.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 645 of 13 January, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
