Updated News Post

A man and a woman arrested in connection with a baby's death in Stoke-on-Trent have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Police were called to a report of a child in cardiac arrest by colleagues from West Midlands Ambulance Service at an address on Derwent Street just before 9pm on 26 November.

The seven-week-old boy was taken to hospital where he sadly died a few hours later.

The death is still being treated as unexplained.

A post mortem has taken place and the results are inconclusive meaning further tests are required.
