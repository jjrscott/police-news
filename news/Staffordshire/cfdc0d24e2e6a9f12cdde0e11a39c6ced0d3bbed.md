Officers are appealing for witnesses to or information about an incident of shoplifting at a pharmacy in Perton.

The incident occurred at the Lloyd's Pharmacy on Anders Square at about 2.40pm on 2 March and saw products worth just under Â£70 taken.

A white man of slim build wearing black trousers and shoes, a dark coloured jumper, bright orange and black coat, white hat and surgical face mask is believed to have taken the products, left the pharmacy and got into a vehicle.

Anyone who may have witnessed what happened at the time or recognises the man in the CCTV images should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 567 of 2 March, or alternatively contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
