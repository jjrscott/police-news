Detectives from Staffordshire Police are seeking the extradition of a 42-year-old man after he was served with a European Arrest Warrant in Sweden.

It follows his arrest by officers in Sweden in connection with the death of 71-year-old Wendy Morse in Knypersley.

Extradition proceedings will now begin to take place.

Detective Inspector Cheryl Hannan, senior investigating officer, said: "We have worked closely with our colleagues from the Crown Prosecution Service to obtain the European Arrest Warrant.

"Cooperation with police and prosecutors in Sweden has ensured his detention. Extradition proceedings are underway and we will continue to conduct a thorough investigation."
