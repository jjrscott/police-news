Police are urging people to be vigilant and not take potentially fatal substances after horse medication was stolen from a stables in Stone.

Officers were called to a property in Moss Lane at about 10am on Friday (18 December) to reports of a burglary which is believed to have taken place shortly after midnight.

Police attended and a total of 20 sachets of horse medication, including tranquilisers, were reported stolen along with a number of power tools.

Thieves took antibiotics, tranquilisers and painkillers, which are only suitable for very large horses.

A circular saw and three drills were also taken.

Officers are reviewing CCTV footage and carrying out a forensic investigation into the incident which is believed to have involved three young male offenders.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Staffordshire Police on Facebook, Twitter or call 101, quoting incident number 183 of 18 December.

Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

If you suspect someone has taken potentially life-threatening substances, call the emergency services on 999.
