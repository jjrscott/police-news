Officers continue to "keep an open mind" as "investigations continue" into a spate of tool thefts from vans across the county that have left tradesman and business owners counting both the mental and physical cost of being able to work.

Since the middle of November incidents have been recorded in towns and villages across the county - but following one recent arrest power tools have been able to be returned to their owner.

Stallington Road and Elm Drive, in Blythe Bridge; Werrington Road and Gratton Road, Bucknall; Wellington Road, Burton upon Trent; Thomas Street, Leek; The Plaisaunce, Friars Walk and Kingsway East, all in Newcastle-under-Lyme; Barley Croft, in Perton; Burton Square, off Rising Brook, Stafford; Greatwood Road, Tean; and Draycott Road in Upper Tean have all recently seen victims reporting either their vans being broken into or taken.

DC Simon Chawner of Staffordshire Police's CID North team said: "We're keeping an open mind over whether any or all of these offences are linked.

"We will continue to pro-actively seek out offenders and if we are able to recover property to return to its owners we will always have the other offences in our minds.

"Investigations continue, and we will always strive to keep vehicle owners safe in the communities we serve so they can keep on working hard without the fear of having their tools stolen from their vans between jobs.

"Following the recent arrest of one man, a 24-year-old from the Derby area for theft from a motor vehicle, and the seizing of a vehicle, some power tools have been identified and returned to one of the owners. This is a really positive development."
