A Staffordshire Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) has helped a village near Cannock achieve dementia-friendly status.

PCSO Natalie Baggott, who covers Heath Hayes, has worked with members of the local business community and the local council to achieve recognition from the Alzheimer's Society for the village. A dementia-friendly community is a city, town or village where people with dementia are understood, respected and supported.

PCSO Baggott said: "The Alzheimer's Society's dementia-friendly communities programme encourages everyone to share responsibility for ensuring that people with dementia feel understood, valued and able to contribute to their community. I worked with shop owners and a local taxi firm to help people spot the signs of dementia and how they can support a customer who is potentially living with dementia.

"It wasn't just me, though. There is also a steering group made up of local councillors, residents and people living with dementia that meets monthly to organise information sessions, events and highlight the support needed and available in the local area.

"I'm really pleased that people living with dementia in Heath Hayes will be considered and supported thanks to the work everyone has done."

Cannock Local Policing Team Commander, Ch Insp Sarah wainwright said: "PCSO Baggott has done a great job on this which has been greatly appreciated by the local Parish Council. I received a letter from them praising the drive and enthusiasm with which she approached this project and stating she was the driving force behind the initiative.

"As the Local Policing Team Commander, I am immensely proud of the work Natalie has done here. She's also recognised by her colleagues as someone who goes the extra mile as she received an award earlier this year from the Staffordshire Association of Women in Policing (SAWP). I have to agree with the council who described her as a credit to Staffordshire Police."
