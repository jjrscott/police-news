Police investigating the organisation of illegal raves in parts of Staffordshire have today arrested four men.

The group - aged between 20 and 24 - have been detained on suspicion of conspiring to commit a public nuisance and remain in police custody.

The arrests have been made as more illegal gatherings are expected in the county over the weekend - with officers urging anyone considering attending to stop and think of the consequences.

Equipment including a generator, amplifier, speakers and a laptop has also been seized.

Chief Superintendent Carl Ratcliffe, Head of Contact and Response for Staffordshire Police, said: "I hope these arrests send a clear message to organisers of illegal raves that we will deal with anyone involved robustly.

"Our priority is the safety of our communities and we will continue to take action against those who put the health of others in jeopardy.

"These gatherings are both illegal and irresponsible and put people at risk with the current global pandemic still not over. We will do all we can to stop these illegal Raves from taking place."

If you have any information about where a rave is being held, contact Staffordshire Police via Facebook or Twitter, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

_*UPDATE* - Detectives can now confirm the arrest of a fifth man. A 19-year-old from Redditch has been detained on suspicion of conspiring to commit a public nuisance and remains in police custody._
