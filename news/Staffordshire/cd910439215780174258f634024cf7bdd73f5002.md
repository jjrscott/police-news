Police are warning people to be on their guard against suspicious callers at the door following a bogus official incident in Cheslyn Hay.

The advice comes after a bogus water official struck at the home of a man at approximately 5pm on Saturday (12 October).

A man claimed he was working for the water board and that he needed to check the water in the property. He entered the property and he stole a quantity of cash.

He is described as white, between 30 and 40-years-old and was wearing a red jacket and baseball cap. Another two men were captured with him on CCTV leaving the area.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone with information, or who saw anyone suspicious and/or vehicles in the area prior to the incident, particularly where men knock on the door unexpectedly.

Anyone with information on the incident is asked to contact Staffordshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 707 of 12 October 2019.
