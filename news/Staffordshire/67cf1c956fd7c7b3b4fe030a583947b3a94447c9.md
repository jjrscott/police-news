Police have shut down a cannabis factory packed with around 250 plants.

Officers uncovered the illicit venture at an unused building on Ford Green Road in Smallthorne following suspicious activity in the area.

Now an investigation is underway as senior officers have welcomed the factory being found and closed down.

Staffordshire Police was called out to the area at around 12.30am on January 6 to reports of suspicious behaviour around the vacant premises.

During a search of the building around 250 cannabis plants were discovered in three different rooms. Western Power were also called out to help make the premises safe.

Chief Inspector Mark Barlow, commander of Stoke-on-Trent North Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "These cannabis factories are often dangerous set-ups which pose a fire risk and I am always pleased to see them stopped from operating in the city.

"We are delighted to have stopped these drugs from reaching the streets of Stoke-on-Trent. Our investigation into this is ongoing."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 0013 of January 6, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
