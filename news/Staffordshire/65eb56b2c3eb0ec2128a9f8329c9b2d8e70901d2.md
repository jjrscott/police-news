A man has been arrested by detectives investigating a series of distraction burglaries in Stoke-on-Trent.

Detectives have linked a series of approximately nine burglaries where elderly people were approached by a man, posing at someone from either the council or a local church, to do odd jobs including carpet cleaning.

A man has then entered, distracted the victim and taken property from inside the house.

The burglaries took place in Hanley, Sneyd Green, Northwood and Forest Park between 11 July and 14 July where cash, jewellery and bank cards were taken.

Detective Sergeant Andy Durber, from force CID, said: "Though no one was injured, incidents such as these can really instil a fear in vulnerable and elderly victims - particularly those who are isolating in their homes due to the on-going pandemic.

"Offenders see the elderly as an easy target. We'd ask people to be vigilant if they are approached at their home by anyone offering trade services or claiming to be from an organisation.

"Always ask for identification and if you're not expecting anyone or don't have an appointment, do not let them into your home.

"Keep all valuables and money in a safe location and contact the police immediately if you have any suspicions about doorstep callers."

A 34-year-old man from Stoke-on-Trent has been arrested on suspicion of burglary. He remains in custody at this time.
