A Tamworth man who raped and assaulted a woman has been jailed for nine years with an extended licence for two years.

Joshua Tate Taylor, 24, of Cleeve, Glascote, Tamworth, was sentenced at Stafford Crown Court on 7 May after pleading guilty to rape, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and two counts of assault by beating at the same court on 13 March.

He will be required to sign the Sex Offenders Register for life.

Taylor was arrested in February 2020. The offences took place in Staffordshire in 2019 and 2020.

DS Michelle Banks, of CID South, said: "I am pleased that the sentence handed down reflects the gravity of the offence.

"This investigation has been a detailed and thorough investigation by the wider CID team and I would like to thank everyone involved for the work they have done to bring Taylor to justice.

"No jail sentence can ever undo the suffering that the victim has endured but I want to praise her for having the bravery and strength to come forward and I hope it brings her some comfort that justice has been done."
