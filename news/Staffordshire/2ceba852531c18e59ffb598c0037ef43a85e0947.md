A 30-year-old man has been charged in connection with the theft of a delivery van in Meir.

It's after police received reports of a stolen Amazon van from the Sandon Road area shortly after 1pm on 14 December 2020.

The van - which had contained a number of parcels - was found a short while later.

Joshua Twigg of Box Lane, Meir, Stoke-on-Trent, is due in court facing charges of theft from a motor vehicle and two counts of taking a motor vehicle without consent.

A 37-year-old woman, from Meir, Stoke-on-Trent, was arrested on suspicion of conspiring to steal a motor vehicle and other related offences. She has since been released under investigation pending further enquiries.
