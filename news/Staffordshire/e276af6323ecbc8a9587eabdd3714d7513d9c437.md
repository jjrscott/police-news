Police are appealing for witnesses after two separate burglaries at Costcutter stores in South Staffordshire.

The first break-in occurred at about 12:30am on Tuesday at the store on Common Road, Wombourne.

Offenders are believed to have disabled the CCTV outside the store before removing a section of the metal shutter and smashing the glass door behind in order to enter the premises.

They stole a quantity of cigarettes, leaving a trail of cigarettes behind them as they exited, travelling in the direction of Blakeley Heath.

The second break-in happened a short time later at a Costcutter store in Great Wyrley.

Officers were called to the Walsall Road store at about 2:20am to reports of four men in a black car attempting to ram-raid the shop.

Two offenders are believed to have then used a crow bar to open the shutter and smash the glass door to enter the store.

They filled a bag with cigarettes before leaving the premises, travelling in the direction of the A34 towards Cannock.

CCTV footage from the store shows offenders wearing dark hoods and face coverings.

The car was later recovered by officers in Bilston.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting incident numbers 630 and 639 of 20 October.
