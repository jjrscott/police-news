Officers are appealing for help from the public in tracing an electronic scooter that was stolen from a teenager in Cannock.

The youngster was in Church Square leading up to 3pm on 16 February when three teenagers approached him, one of whom had a machete-type weapon. They took his electric scooter and threatened him with violence, chasing him into the McDonalds restaurant on Church Street.

The scooter is described as all black with red trim and is called an X7 Pro Electric Scooter, made by Official Hoverboard. It comes in a brown cardboard box, the same size as a small child's bike, and the box has a yellow plastic strap at each end.

Anyone who knows the whereabouts of the scooter or who is offered one matching the above description for sale should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 411 of 16 February, or alternatively contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
