Officers on a proactive patrol intervened in a suspected robbery in Tamworth yesterday.

The incident took place in Hawksworth, Glascote, at around 2.30pm on Monday, January 11.

Yesterday Staffordshire Police arrested a 14-year-old boy on suspicion of attempted robbery and a 15-year-old boy on suspicion of robbery and possession of a Class A drug. Both were later released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Meanwhile a 17-year-old male was arrested earlier this morning on suspicion of attempted robbery. He remains in police custody.

Chief Inspector Paul Talbot, of Tamworth Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "Response and local officers regularly patrol Tamworth on a proactive basis and on this occasion were definitely in the right area, coming across the incident in progress. I would ask any witnesses to come forward as the investigation continues."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 0385 of January 11, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
