Officers are investigating following a spate of distraction burglaries targeting the elderly in the Hanley and Cobridge area.

Officers are investigating following a spate of distraction burglaries targeting the elderly in the Hanley and Cobridge area.

In the last few days, there has been four incidents where a man is asking to do odd jobs including carpet cleaning claiming to be from either the council or the local church. The man then talks his way into the house or distracts the victim asking for a drink. He then steals property from inside the house.

The man is described as white, under 6ft tall, aged in his 20s or 30s with very short dark hair. He has a local accent, may have stubble on his chin and has a scruffy appearance. He has used a clip board/note pad and a lanyard as props.

Sergeant Phillip Ferns, deputy commander of Stoke North Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "Though no one was injured, incidents such as these can really instil a fear in vulnerable or elderly victims.

"We're urging people to be vigilant if they are approached at their home by anyone offering trade services or claiming to be from an organisation. Always ask for identification and if you are not expecting anyone or don't have an appointment, do not let them into your home.

"Keep all valuables and money in a safe location and contact the police immediately if you have any suspicions about doorstep callers."
