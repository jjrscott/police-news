A Kidsgrove man has been given a hospital order after pleading guilty to manslaughter with diminished responsibility of his father in 2014.

Gareth Ainscow, 49, pleaded guilty to the offence in a hearing at Stafford Crown Court today (28 July).

He was sentenced to a hospital order indefinitely.

The court heard that police had attended a house in Whitehill Road, Kidsgrove, on 11 September 2014 and found Ainscow.

Ainscow's 66-year-old father, David Ainscow, was in the house and had suffered knife wounds. Despite the attendance of a paramedic he died shortly afterwards.

Ainscow dropped a bloodied knife when told to do so and was arrested. He told police his father had assaulted him.
