Detectives are appealing for information following a burglary at a rural business in Elford.

At around 1.45am on Saturday 9 May, two offenders forced entry to an outbuilding and stole specialist farming equipment - including five John Deere GPS domes and seven computer screens - with an approximate value of Â£60,000.

Detective Constable Ken Cox, from CID, said: "The investigation is on-going and we are appealing for anyone in the Elford area who saw anything suspicious on Friday evening, or the early hours of Saturday morning, to come forward and speak to officers.

"If you know where the stolen property is, or have been offered these items for sale, please get in touch."

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 or report online, quoting incident number 237 of 09 May.

You can also report crime by contacting the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
