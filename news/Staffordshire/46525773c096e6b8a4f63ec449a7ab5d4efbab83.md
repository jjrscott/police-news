A woman has been arrested after an incident in Stoke-on-Trent where ambulance and police officers were spat at.

An ambulance was called to King Street, Fenton, at around 1am this morning (April 10) following reports a woman required an ambulance.

On arrival the ambulance crew called police for assistance and the woman allegedly spat at three police officers and a member of ambulance staff. She was arrested for assaulting emergency workers.

A 37-year-old woman from Newcastle-under-Lyme remains in custody.

Staffordshire Police Assistant Chief Constable Simon Tweats said: "Unfortunately, there have now been several incidents where nurses, ambulance crews and police officers have been subjected to spitting and coughing.

"Frontline staff are out there serving our communities and this kind of behaviour is despicable. We will arrest those responsible and put them before the courts."

"However, I'm glad that overall we're receiving great support across Staffordshire as we work together to stop the spread of Covid-19."
