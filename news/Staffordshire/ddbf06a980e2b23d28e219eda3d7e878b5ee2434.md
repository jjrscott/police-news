Officers from Staffordshire Police have called off the search for missing person Alan Wilton, who was last seen in Abbey Hulton on Thursday 3 October.

Sadly, the body of a man, believed to be 55-year-old Alan, was found yesterday evening (10 October) in an area off Uplands Road in Abbey Hulton.

His family have been informed and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.

Formal identification will take place in due course. Detectives do not believe there are any suspicious circumstances and a report will be prepared for HM Coroner.
