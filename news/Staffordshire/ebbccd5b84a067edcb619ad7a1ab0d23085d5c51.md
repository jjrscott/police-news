Officers have arrested a man after a Taser-type device was used in a robbery at a baker's shop in Lichfield this morning.

We were called to Greggs at Baker's Lane, Lichfield, at around 7.40am after reports that two female members of staff had been threatened and forced to access a safe.

A Taser-type device was used on one of the women. She is unharmed, but understandably distressed by the incident.

An undisclosed amount of cash was taken. Following enquiries, at around 9am a vehicle was stopped near Swadlincote in Derbyshire. A man aged 33 from Coventry was arrested on suspicion of robbery, possession of class A drugs and theft of a motor vehicle.

He is in custody. Enquiries are ongoing to locate a second man.

Detective sergeant Peter Brazendale, of Staffordshire Police, said: "We want to reassure people that this was an isolated incident. We have patrols in the area and, following a swift first arrest, enquiries are ongoing to locate another man we believe was involved.

"This was a frightening experience for the women at the shop and we welcome any information the public can provide to assist us."

Anyone with information that may assist us is urged to contact Staffordshire Police on 101 or via Facebook/Twitter referring to incident 100 of 9 January.

Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555111.
