We're appealing for information after a road traffic collision near Leek.

It's after officers were called to the A53 Upper Hulme shortly before 3pm on Sunday 11 October following reports of a multi vehicle road traffic collision - involving a red Peugeot 206, a blue Lotus Elise and a yellow Aprilia Motorcycle.

The motorcyclist - a 42-year-old man - was taken to hospital via air ambulance having sustained serious injuries. He remains in a critical but stable condition in hospital.

The driver of the Peugeot, a 35-year-old woman was also taken to hospital by land ambulance, alongside a two-year-old child for treatment whilst the driver of the Lotus - a 33-year-old man was also treated for minor injuries.

Officers from the Staffordshire and West Midlands Serious Collision Investigation Unit are now appealing for witnesses and are asking for anyone with dashcam footage to get in touch - quoting incident number 407 of 11 October.
