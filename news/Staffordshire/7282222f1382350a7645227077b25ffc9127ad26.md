One man has been arrested and a quantity of class A and B drugs has been seized after officers carried out a series of warrants in Cannock.

Officers simultaneously conducted the warrants on Thursday (18 March) as part of ongoing Operation Corbel which is aimed at disrupting organised crime and drug dealing in the Cannock area.

Police conducted the raids at a total of five properties in Cannock and West Chadsmoor during the raids, made under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

A 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply after a quantity of class A drugs and weapons were discovered.

He is due to be interviewed later and remains in police custody.

Another man, aged 22, was initially detained but later released to be interviewed at a later date, following the recovery of a quantity of class B drugs.

Sergeant Matt Slattery, who organised the raids, said: "These raids show we are determined to do all we can to tackle drug-related incidents in the Cannock area and I'd like to reassure the community that we will continue to disrupt criminal activity across the district."
