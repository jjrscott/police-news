A man suffered injuries to his head and neck after being hit by a car driven by men stealing from a farm in south Staffordshire.

Detectives are appealing for information about the incident which happened at around 10.30am on Monday (January 27) at Wood Hall Farm, Codsall Wood.

Men were working on surveying drainage at the farm when a Mitsubishi Shogun pulled up in nearby Moatbrook Lane and men got out and stole laser equipment.

One of the surveyors gave chase and was struck by the Shogun, which is described as black, with a long wheel base, and rear windscreen damage.

Detective Sergeant Katie Gregory, of Staffordshire Police, said: "We're seeking help from anyone who may have witnessed this incident or may have information about these men or this 4x4 vehicle.

"Although I'm glad to say the victim is recovering, the reckless and dangerous actions of these men could have resulted in very serious or life-changing injuries."

Anyone with information is urged to contact Staffordshire Police on 101 referring to incident 187 of 27 January or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
