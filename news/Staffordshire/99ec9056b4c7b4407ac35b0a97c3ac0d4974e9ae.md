Staffordshire Police is issuing a warning to remind vehicle owners to keep their cars locked and valuables hidden out of sight following an increase in thefts from vehicles in Tamworth.

These types of incidents have been reported over the past few weeks, with the thefts occurring overnight in different parts of town. Stolen items have included cash, bank cards and electronics.

Chief Inspector Paul Talbot, Commander for Tamworth Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "The investigation into this latest series of thefts from vehicles in Tamworth is a priority for our local policing team and we are following a number of lines of enquiry.

"However, please could I ask for residence support by taking simple steps to stop yourselves from becoming a victim of car crime. Please make sure your vehicle is locked, even for short stops and especially overnight. Remember to remove all valuables, including sat nav systems, loose change, wallets, coats, bags; don't leave anything on show for opportunistic thieves.

"If you have to store your work equipment in your vehicle, please make sure tools are securely locked away, as these items have also been stolen from unsecure vehicles recently. We also recommend marking any machinery or tools and place a sticker in your window to say you have done so. It can be an effective deterrent or help us to identify your property in the future."
