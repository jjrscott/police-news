A man has been sentenced to more than six years in prison for drug offences in Cannock.

Demitre Delahaye, of Shropshire Way in West Bromwich, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six years and 9 months in jail on September 25, at Stafford Crown Court, for three counts of possession with intent to supply cocaine and one count of possession of intent to supply cannabis.

The 28-year-old was detained getting off of a bus in Cannock town centre on 25 July after attempting and failing to swallow a large packet of drugs.

Sergeant Lee Hardy said: "We are very pleased with the sentence handed down and to see another person concerned in the supply of drugs jailed and taken off of the streets."
