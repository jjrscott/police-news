The family of a woman who died in Stoke-on-Trent have paid tribute to her.

This follows the formal identification of 33-year-old Danielle Mather on Tuesday (17 Nov).

Ms Mather died in hospital on 13 November after police were called to property on South Walk, Meir, at midday on 12 November to reports of a woman in cardiac arrest.

In a statement, Ms Mather's family said: "Danielle was a kind, outgoing and loving person who listened to anybody who needed the time.

"She had travelled various parts of the world and later settled down in Stoke-on-Trent after studying at university.

"She will be sorely missed by family and friends and leaves a huge hole in our lives."

A post-mortem examination has taken place but further tests are required.

A 34-year-old man, from Sandwell, arrested on suspicion of murder remains on conditional police bail while inquiries continue.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 258 of 12 Nov, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
