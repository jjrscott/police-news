Staffordshire Police Officer, PC Claire Bond, who suffered serious injuries on duty last year, is taking part in a fundraising activity for the charity COPS (Care of Police Survivors).

Claire suffered life-changing injuries to her legs when Gurajdeep Malhi drove at her as she attempted to arrest him in the Coton Fields area of Stafford on 23 September last year. PC Bond was trapped between the BMW and a garden fence and was dragged several metres and flung to the floor as the car sped away. Malhi then drove forward and again reversed at PC Bond, who was saved by PC Mullins who pulled her out of the way.

As part of her recovery, and to mark the anniversary of the attack, Claire has signed up to complete the Stafford 10K this Sunday (22 September) and raise money for COPS. She will be accompanied by her husband, Darren, and PC Dave Mullins.

Claire said: "I suffered life-changing injuries and, after three operations and treatment, I am finally trying to move forward with both my physical and mental recovery.

"Now the sentencing has taken place, my focus is on my recovery. I may not be able to walk the entire 10k, but as long as I can get up and walk the last kilometre on my feet and cross the finish line with Dave I will be happy.

Supt Carl Ratcliffe said: ''It's great to see that Claire is at the stage in her recovery where she can take part in the Stafford 10k and typically, she is putting others before herself in taking part to raise funds for such a worthwhile cause.

"Claire continues to make us all feel proud of her determination and courage. We can't wait to see her cross the finishing line.''
