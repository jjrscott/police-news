Detectives are continuing to appeal for witnesses to a fatal non-stop collision in Cannock on New Year's Eve.

Sadly a 62-year-old woman died following the non-stop collision that occurred at around 6.30pm, at the junction between Pye Green Road and Saint Aidan's Road. The woman, who was driving a mobility scooter at the time, was involved in a collision with a car, believed to be a silver VW Golf. Despite the best efforts of emergency services staff, she died at the scene.

At around 2:45am this morning (1 January) officers arrested a 27-year-old man from Cannock in the Hednesford area. He was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and failing to stop and remains in custody for questioning.

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Cooke, senior investigating officer for Staffordshire Police, said: "Detectives are still investigating this incident and I would ask that anyone who may have witnessed it or who was driving in the area at that time with a dashcam to please come forward.

"We are continuing to support the woman's family and it is important that we establish the circumstances that led up to her death."
