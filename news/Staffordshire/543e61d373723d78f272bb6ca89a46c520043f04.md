We are appealing for information after a van full of tools was stolen from an address in Tamworth.

A white Vauxhall Vivaro van was taken from outside an address on Ribblesdale in Stonydelph at approximately 7pm on Friday (18 December).

It was found abandoned on its side in Kedleston Road in Weston Underwood, Derbyshire, at about 3.15am on Saturday (19 December).

The van is described as plain white with no writing or markings on the side and was full of tools used for tiling. There was no glass on the floor by where the van was parked and the thieves' means of entry is unknown.

If anyone heard or saw anything suspicious at the time of the incident, or has dashcam footage of what might be the van driving away, message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 229 of 19 December, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
