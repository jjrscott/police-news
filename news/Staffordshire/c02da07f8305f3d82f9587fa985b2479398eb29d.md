Officers are appealing for information after a 16-year-old boy was attacked with a hammer in an attempted robbery in Rocester.

The victim was struck at around 9:30pm on Mill Road, on Saturday, while walking with friends towards Ashbourne Road.

Officers believe a minicab pulled up close to the victim and three masked males, wearing balaclavas, approached the group and attempted to steal their air pod headphones and mobile phones.

One suspect then struck the victim over the head with the hammer.

The victim was taken to Royal Derby Hospital where he was treated for minor head injuries and later discharged.

His friends, males and females aged 15 years to 18 years old, were unhurt in the attempted robbery.

The suspects then got back into the vehicle and were driven away along Mill Street in the direction of Marston Montgomery.

Anyone who saw a silver four-door VW Passat or Toyota Avensis minicab travelling around Rocester at the time of the attack is asked to get in touch with police.

Detective Constable Jason Hughes of Lichfield CID said: "This is a very concerning incident involving a child who was attacked by a group of unknown men.

"We are currently reviewing CCTV footage of the area at the time and would urge anyone who saw what happened to get in touch with police to help us with our ongoing inquries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Staffordshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 931 of 31 October.
