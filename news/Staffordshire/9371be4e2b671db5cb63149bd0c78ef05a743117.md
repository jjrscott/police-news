A misconduct hearing into a former Staffordshire Police sergeant has found that he would have been dismissed had he not resigned.

Jamie McArthur, 39, was investigated following allegations he engaged in sexual relationships where he neglected his duties and responsibilities as a police officer between March 2010 and May 2017, and April 2017 and July 2017.

McArthur resigned in April 2018.

The hearing which concluded today (Tuesday 26 January), chaired by an independent legally qualified person, found that his actions amounted to gross misconduct.

Deputy Chief Constable, Emma Barnett, said: "McArthur let his colleagues and the public down, and his actions represented a fundamental betrayal of the public and the values for which the police stand for.

"The public rightly expect police officers to maintain exemplary standards of integrity and professionalism and the outcome of the misconduct hearing is an indication of how far below those standards his behaviour fell.

"Although regulations allow an officer to resign while under investigation for gross misconduct, the misconduct process will still continue. He will now be placed on the national College of Policing's Barred List preventing him from working within policing and other law enforcement bodies."
