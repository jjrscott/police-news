We are appealing for witnesses and warning publicans to monitor security after a series of pub break-ins in Tamworth.

Offenders have targeted nine licensed premises in the town since March 30. They are targeting games machines for cash.

Chief Inspector Ash Farrington, of Tamworth Neighbourhood Policing Team, urged publicans to ensure their properties were secure and that cash had been removed from premises.

"Of course the lockdown means pubs are not open and can be seen as targets for opportunistic thieves and burglars. If anyone has witnessed any of these incidents then please get in touch."

Chief Inspector Farrington said that publicans should consider putting up signs to make it clear cash has been removed from premises.

"We're investigating a number of possible leads but would welcome further assistance from the public."

The pubs that have been targeted:

• Ladybridge Beefeater, Bonehill Road (March 30)
• White Lion, Aldergate (April 1)
• Centurion Park Brewer's Fayre, Wilnecote (April 4)
• Queen's Head, Watling Street, Wilnecote (April 4)
• Winning Post, Aryle Street (April 4)
• Bolebridge, Bolebridge Street (April 5)
• Tamworth Arms, Lichfield Street (April 5)
• Amington, Amington Road (April 6)
• Old Liberal House, Woodhouse Lane (April 6)

Anyone with information should contact Staffordshire Police via Facebook or Twitter or call 101 referring to incident 817 of April 4 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
