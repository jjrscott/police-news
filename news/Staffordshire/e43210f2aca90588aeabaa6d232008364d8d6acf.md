Staffordshire Police officers have arrested two men on suspicion of possessing a firearm.

We were called to what appears to be a domestic-related incident on Apedale Road, Chesterton, at around 11.30pm last night (14 September).

Officers, followed by specially trained armed police, attended and two men aged 21 and 22, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, were arrested at the scene. Both remain in police custody at this time.

A weapon has been recovered and will now be subject to a detailed forensic examination.

As a result of this incident an increased police presence will remain in the area, and there will be high visibility patrols by local neighbourhood officers today (Sunday 15 September) to provide reassurance to residents.

Detectives are carrying out enquiries and witnesses, or anyone with information, is asked to call 101 quoting incident 964 of 14 September. Alternatively, for guaranteed anonymity, call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
