Police are appealing for information after figures reveal areas of North Staffordshire have seen an increase in motorcycle theft.

Since 17 February, the force has received a total of 22 reports of such thefts, in comparison to 14 reported in the previous month.

Noted hotspots include Newcastle, Stoke North and Stoke South, with most of the thefts taking place overnight.

Most recently, a Keeway motorbike was stolen from Weston Coyney on 16 March.

Officers currently have several lines of inquiry in relation to these thefts and urge anyone with information to get in touch.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
