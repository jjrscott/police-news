A man has sadly died following a fatal road traffic collision near Tamworth last night.

Officers were called at 7:45pm to a report of a road traffic collision on the A5 at Hints between the Weeford Interchange and Tamworth.

The collision involved a white Mercedes sprinter van that collided with the rear of a silver Ford Focus that was stationary just around a mile and a half after the Weeford Interchange.

Despite the efforts of emergency services, a man in his 60s, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene with his family being offered support from specialist officers at this difficult time.

An investigation is underway and officers are appealing for any witnesses to come forward.

Anyone with information or relevant dash-cam footage is asked to call 101 quoting incident number 686 of 22 February or direct message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter. Alternatively you can contact officers from the Staffordshire and West Midlands Serious Collision Investigation Unit on ciu@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk.
