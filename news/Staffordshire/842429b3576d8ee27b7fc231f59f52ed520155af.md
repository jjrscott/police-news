Couriers have been warned to be vigilant when out delivering - after a driver had a number of parcels stolen from his van in Stoke-on-Trent.

Staffordshire Police received a report of the delivery driver being targeted on Ridgway Road by Hanley Park at around 5pm on Wednesday, December 16.

It was reported three men approached the rear of the van - while the driver was also in the back locating a parcel - and started to take packages. It is believed they took eight parcels before making off in a car.

Chief Inspector Mark Barlow, of the Stoke North Neighborhood Policing Team, said: "This is a busy time of year for delivery drivers and should they be targeted in this way it is important they contact the police immediately."

Anyone with information on the incident in Hanley should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 0605 of December 16, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
