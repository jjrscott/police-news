Four men have been arrested after reports of disorder in Cobridge last week.

Last Tuesday (26 January), police were called just before 9pm to reports of damage to a car on Kirby Street. A car's bonnet was stuck by a brick and had its rear windscreen broken.

In the early hours of Friday (29 January), police were called again at 12.05am, to reports of men with weapons on Rushton Road and Kirby Road. Windows of houses were smashed on both streets and a car's windows were smashed on Rushton Road.

The men, two aged 31, one aged 29 and one aged 35, all from Stoke-on-Trent, have been arrested on suspicion of affray. They have been bailed pending further enquiries.

Detective Inspector Scott McGrath, of CID North, said: "We are aware that there are reports of disorder in the area and people are understandably concerned. We would like to reassure members of the public that we are working closely with the Stoke North Neighbourhood Policing Team and we will take firm action where appropriate."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 3 of 29 January. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 111 555.
