A 21-year-old man from Stone has been jailed after breaching his Criminal Behaviour Order in the town.

Brandon Dickinson, of Runnymede, was jailed for eight weeks by magistrates in Newcastle-under-Lyme yesterday (Nov 24).

The court heard that on Monday (23 November) he was arrested by officers from Stafford Borough Neighbourhood Policing Team and charged with breaching the order on three occasions.

Dickinson was remanded in custody and appeared before magistrates yesterday, where he was sentenced for three breaches during September and October.

Chief Inspector Giles Parsons, of Stafford Borough Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We were aware Brandon Dickinson had breached his order and officers acted swiftly to make the arrest and bring him before the courts.

"We appreciate the support we are receiving from people in Stone and we will continue to work hard to address criminal activity and anti-social behaviour and bring offenders before the courts."
