Officers are appealing for information after a series of jewellery thefts in Stoke North and Newcastle.

Offenders are believed to be targeting Asian family gold, accessing properties through unsecured first floor windows.

There were five reported offences in Newcastle and three in Cobridge on Saturday (21 Nov) which are believed to have taken place between 4.30pm and 10.30pm.

On one occasion, Â£4,000 worth of jewelry was stolen.

On other occasions, offenders left empty handed, after being disturbed by residents and neighbours.

It is believed the suspects may be travelling in a stolen blue Audi S3.

Anyone with information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
