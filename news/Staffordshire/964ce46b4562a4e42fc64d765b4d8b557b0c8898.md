A Burton man who ran from police has been jailed for three years after admitting drugs offences in the town.

Nathan Samways, aged 20, was jailed at Stafford Crown Court after pleading guilty to possession with intent to supply crack cocaine, possession with intention to supply heroin, possessing criminal property and obstructing a police officer in the execution of their duty.

The court heard that Samways, of Pinewood Road, Stapenhill, was approached by officers on 16 November near his home address.

Samways ran away but was detained on Rosliston Road. An initial search uncovered three wraps of heroin and three mobile phones. Following arrest Samways tried to discard a further package of class A drugs and Â£275 in cash was found on him during a strip search.

He was jailed on 18 December.
