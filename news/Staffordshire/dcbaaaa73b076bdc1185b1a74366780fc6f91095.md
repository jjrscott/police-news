Officers have arrested seven teenage boys on suspicion of affray following an incident in Rugeley yesterday (Thursday).

Police were called to Sandy Lane at 6.50pm after reports of a train driver being assaulted and further disorder near Rugeley railway station.

A 16-year-old, 18-year-old and two 17-year-olds from Walsall along with two 16-year-olds from Cannock and a 16-year-old from Brownhills were all taken into custody where they remain at this time.

Deputy Chief Inspector Mark Burslem of Cannock Chase Neighbourhood Policing Team said: "We are aware that there are reports of disorder in the area and people are understandably concerned. We would like to reassure members of the public that we will be increasing patrols and this sort of behaviour is taken very seriously and will not be tolerated."

Anyone with concerns should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 587 of December 5, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
