A man has been extradited from Sweden and charged with the murder of a woman in Knypersley.

Kenneth Andrew McDermid, 42, of Rosemary Place, Sneyd Green, Stoke-on-Trent, who arrived in the UK on Tuesday, has been charged with the murder of Wendy Morse in March.

He appeared before magistrates at the North Staffordshire Justice Centre this morning (Wednesday 20 May) and is due to appear at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on Friday (22 May).

McDermid was arrested on suspicion of murder by Swedish authorities at the end of March and remained in custody until extradition proceedings were complete.
