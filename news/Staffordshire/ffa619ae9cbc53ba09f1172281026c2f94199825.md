A man whose dog caused severe injuries to a woman in Leek has been jailed.

Ian Gough, 33, of Compton House, Leek, pleaded guilty to having a dog dangerously out of control and causing injury at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on 4 September.

At around 5.30pm on 24 November last year, a woman was walking along Garden Street when she was attacked by the Staffordshire Bull Terrier-type dog owned by Gough. The dog grabbed her right leg causing severe injuries which required a hospital admission and surgery. She was left with extensive scarring.

In addition to his 19 month prison sentence, Gough was also banned from owning a dog for a period of eight years and the dog was ordered to be destroyed.

Moorlands Neighbourhood Policing Team deputy commander,Sgt Rob Peacock said: "The woman injured in this attack suffered horrific injuries. She was just walking down the road and did nothing to provoke the dog, which was dangerously out of control. Gough was unable to prevent the dog from running away from him and the consequence of this is that a woman has been scarred for life.

"Dog ownership is a responsibility and needs to be taken seriously. Owners need to make sure that their animal is safe to be around people. Otherwise, the consequences can be serious."
