Detectives are appealing for information after three teenagers were threatened with a knife in Tamworth on Wednesday (15 July).

A 16-year-old boy and two 15-year-old girls were approached by a male and threatened with a knife in an attempt robbery near to David Owen's cycles at around 4pm.

One of the girls intervened but was grabbed around the face, suffering a minor facial injury.

The boy, who was wearing a black top, black gloves and a black mask, made off towards the castle grounds in the direction of the white footbridge empty handed.

Anyone with information or may have seen anything is asked to message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter or call 101 quoting incident number 428 of 15 July.

Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
