Detectives are appealing for witnesses to an armed robbery that took place at a Co-op store in Streetly yesterday (Sunday 17 January) to come forward.

We were called at about 8.25pm by staff members who said they had just been robbed by three men carrying a sword at the store on Thornhill Road.

The men entered the shop with a sword, described as approximately 12 inches in length, ornate, and Samurai-style with a black and gold handle, demanding a member of staff open the tills.

The staff member was not physically hurt during the incident and the men fled on foot.

Three men were seen fleeing onto Leslie Road and drove off in a blue car towards Hardwick Road. Two are described as wearing dark clothing with their hoods up. A third man was said to be wearing a grey hoodie with a stripe down the side.

Detectives are asking people who were in the area at the time to check their dash-cam footage for this vehicle.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 643 of 17 January, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
