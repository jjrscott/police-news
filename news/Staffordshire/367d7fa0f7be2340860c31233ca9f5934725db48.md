A former Uttoxeter man has been jailed for twelve-and-a-half years after admitting a series of sex offences in the town in the 1990s.

Kenneth Dyche, aged 85, who now lives in Worcester, pleaded guilty to attempted rape of a boy in 1997. He also admitted six counts of indecently assaulting boys aged under 14, between 1992 and 1998.

Dyche also pleaded guilty to indecency with a child under 14 in 1997.

He was sentenced at Stafford Crown Court on Friday (11 September).

Sergeant Kramer Caldwell, of Staffordshire Police, said: "I want to pay tribute to the victims, who not only had the bravery to come forward, but also had the confidence in the police that what they said to officers would be listened to.

"The offending went back to the 1990s, but we investigated the crimes and took action. Victims of sexual offences should come forward, no matter how long the passage of time, and tell police what happened. They will be listened to and we will bring offenders before the courts."

Dyche has been added to the sex offenders' register for life.

Anyone who has suffered sexual abuse, or suspects others may be subject to sexual abuse, is urged to contact Staffordshire Police on 101.
