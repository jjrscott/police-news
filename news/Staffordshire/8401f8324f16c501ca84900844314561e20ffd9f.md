A man from Longton has been jailed after officers witnessed a drug deal taking place in Fenton.

44-year-old Ronald Meek, of Caroline Street, was arrested at the junction of Carron Street and Goldenhill Road on 16 May 2020 after being spotted by plain clothed officers.

A quick search found 23 wraps of heroin and 26 wraps of crack cocaine - worth approximately Â£500 - hidden in a Kinder egg.

He's now been sentenced to 28 months in prison after pleading guilty at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court to two counts of possession with intent to supply controlled Class A drugs.

Sergeant Marc Proctor from the Stoke South Neighbourhood Policing team said: "We're thrilled with Meek's sentencing and it's testament to great work by local officers in taking a proactive action.

"This was a drug problem that was causing a lot of concern to residents in the area and we hope this acts a deterrent to anyone considering becoming involved in any drugs activity in our county."
