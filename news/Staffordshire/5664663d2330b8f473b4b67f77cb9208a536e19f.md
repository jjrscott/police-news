There will be no further action taken against a man and woman who were arrested following a house fire in Stafford in February 2019.

Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service investigators believe the fire was accidental and caused by smoking materials.

Following a complex investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service has advised there will be no further action taken against a man, aged 30, and woman, aged 26, who were initially arrested and released under investigation following the fire in Sycamore Drive, Stafford, on 5 February 2019.

Detective Inspector Alan Lyford, of Staffordshire Police, who has led the investigation, said: "We appreciate this has been a lengthy process, but it was right and proper that this investigation was a thorough and complex one given the dreadful loss of four young lives.

"This tragic case has deeply affected the local community, who have rallied round to support the family. We would again like to thank the community for their patience and support."

The inquest into the deaths of Riley John Holt, aged 8, Keegan Jonathan Unitt, aged 6, Tilly Rose Unitt, aged 4, and Olly Unitt aged 3, will take place later this year.
