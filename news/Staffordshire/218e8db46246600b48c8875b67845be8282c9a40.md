A Tamworth teenager has been jailed for drugs offences and possessing weapons, including a crossbow and stun gun.

Lyndon Sadler, aged 18, of Kettlebrook Road, was sentenced to seven years today (Nov 20) at Stafford Crown Court.

The court heard Sadler had been arrested on 15 April after a Citroen C4 was stopped on the A4091 in Tamworth just after midday.

Sadler was in the passenger seat. Officers found he had snap seal bags, electronic scales, a burner phone, iPhone, and cannabis labels in his possession.

During a subsequent search at a property in Kettlebrook Road officers found MDMA tablets and cannabis worth an estimated Â£3,600 and weapons including machetes, knives, a crossbow, a baseball bat and a disguised stun gun.

Shotgun cartridges were found in the loft space.

Sadler pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply MDMA and cannabis. He was found guilty of possessing an offensive weapon (an electrical incapacitation device).

Detective Inspector Tim Boulton, of Staffordshire Police, said: "We're glad Sadler has been sentenced and these dangerous weapons will now be destroyed.

"It was good detective work that led to this vehicle stop and a search that resulted in Sadler's jail time and the destruction of these weapons and drugs."

Sadler will serve his sentence at a Young Offenders' Institution (YOI).
