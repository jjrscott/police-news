Officers are appealing for witnesses after an elderly woman's home was ransacked overnight and rare coins stolen.

A woman in her 80s was burgled sometime after 11pm last night (27 July) and 7am this morning (28 July) at an address on Walk Lane in Wombourne. Cash and 22 carat gold sovereign coins belonging to her late husband were taken.

It is believed the offenders climbed into the property through a window and carried out an untidy search.

Cash was taken and eight Sovereign coins were taken, including: George V 1911, 1911 and 1915, Edward VII 1904, 1909, 1910 and 1910 and Victoria 1900.

Sergeant Kelly Wareing, deputy commander for South Staffordshire, said: "This burglary has left the vulnerable woman shaken after she came downstairs to find her house in such a state.

"The Sovereign coins are of significance to the woman as they belonged to her late husband and have been in her family since he was a child. Anyone who may see them for sale or see them anywhere else are asked to get in touch.

"Anyone with information or may have seen anything should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter or call 101 quoting incident number 93 of 28 July.

"Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
