Staffordshire Police is reminding residents to take simple crime prevention measures this autumn as burglaries often increase at this time of year.

This reminder comes following a number of break-ins reported across the county in the past week, as burglars take advantage of the longer hours of darkness.

Crime prevention doesn't have to cost a lot of money, there are simple measures you can take to make your home look occupied and reduce your chances of being a victim.

To keep opportunist burglars at bay:

\- Always keep doors and windows locked, even when you're in. Remove the keys from the lock and keep them out of view or reach.
\- Use timer switches to turn lights on when you are out. Alternate the times and lights that you use.
\- Make sure your alarm and any outside lights are in working order. Always activate your alarm when you leave the house and go to bed.
\- Don't leave items of value on show through ground floor windows (i.e. laptops, tablets, mobile phones, car keys etc.)
\- Lock your garden gates and side entrances. Keep ladders and tools securely stored away, don't leave them outside where they could be used to break into your home.
\- Consider joining our Smart Alert scheme and following your neighbourhood policing teams on Facebook and Twitter so you can receive crime alerts and prevention advice from your local police officers.
\- Look out for your neighbours, especially the elderly and vulnerable, and remind them to follow the STOP, CHAIN and CHECK rule when people call at the door:
STOP: If you are not expecting anybody and they don't have an appointment, don't let them in.
CHAIN: Use your door chain or bar before opening the door.
CHECK: Ask to see ID and double check this.
\- Local residents are encouraged to contact the police if they have any suspicions about doorstep callers or witness any suspicious behaviour.
