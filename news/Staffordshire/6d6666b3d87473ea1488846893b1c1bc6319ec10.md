Officers are appealing for information after a series of catalytic converter thefts.

Police were first called to Back Lane in Whittington at about 9pm on Tuesday (24 Nov)to reports that a converter had been removed from a car.

Officers attended and spoke to witnesses who described offenders as four men wearing masks, travelling in a white Toyota or Ford Focus car.

The suspects are believed to have used an electric saw to remove the converter before departing in the direction of Cappers Lane.

Shortly afterwards, a further theft was reported on Efflinch Lane in Barton where four masked men threatened the victim with wooden bats, before driving off towards the village.

Offenders were then spotted on Stanhope Street in Winshill where they reportedly struck again, stealing a converter from a woman's car while it was parked on her drive, behind her husband's vehicle.

Officers were called about an hour later to High Bank Road in Winshill, to reports of a further theft. The suspects were reportedly wearing hooded jumpers and face masks.

Police were then alerted on Wednesday morning (25 Nov) to reports of an attempted theft again on Efflinch Lane at about 9.30pm on Tuesday (24 Nov) where suspects were unable to remove a converter and left empty-handed after being disturbed.

Police are currently reviewing CCTV footage and ask anyone with information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter, quoting incident number 713 of 24 November or 104 of 25 November. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
