Police were called to a report of a robbery at a jewellers on Gaolgate Street in Stafford just after 11am this morning (16 January).

Two-high value rings were stolen, and a staff member was assaulted as the offender made off.

Members of the public attempted to intervene as he fled the scene in a waiting car.

Officers from the Central Motorway Police Group stopped the vehicle a short time later at Keele Services on the M6.

A 34-year-old man and a 32-year-old woman, both from Liverpool, were arrested on suspicion of robbery.

They remain in custody at this time.
