A 29-year-old Burton man has been jailed for five-and-a-half years after being found guilty of drugs offences in the town.

Akeeb Hussain was jailed at Stafford Crown Court (Oct 5) after being found guilty of possession with intent to supply cocaine and cannabis in Burton-on-Trent on 19 June last year.

Officers stopped Hussain, of St Jude's Way, and he was found to have 8.8 grams of cocaine and 98.97 grams of cannabis in his possession.

He was found guilty at an earlier hearing on 17 July and sentenced to 66 months for the cocaine offence and a concurrent sentence of 12 months for the cannabis.

Detective Inspector Tim Boulton, of Staffordshire Police, said: "We are working hard to tackle drugs coming into Staffordshire and, through operations such as Disrupt and County Lines initiatives we are bringing offenders before the courts.

"We welcome any information members of the public can provide to help us."
