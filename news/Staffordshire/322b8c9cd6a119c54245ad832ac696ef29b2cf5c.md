Police are appealing for witnesses of a fatal road traffic collision in Burton this evening (1 October).

Officers were called to a report of a collision on St Peters Bridge, Burton at around 5pm. The collision was between a motorcycle and multiple vehicles. Sadly the rider of the motorcycle passed away a short while later despite the best efforts of paramedics. Next of kin have been informed and his family are now being supported by specially-trained officers.

A 72-year-old man from Lichfield was arrested at the scene of the incident on suspicion of causing death by careless driving and being unfit to drive through drink or drugs. He remains in custody for questioning by officers from the Staffordshire and West Midlands Collision Investigation Unit.

Witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage are asked to call 101 or email ciu@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk quoting incident number 560 of 1 October.
