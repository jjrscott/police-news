Following last night's incident in Biddulph - whereby seven teenagers were arrested on suspicion of affray - officers in the Staffordshire Moorlands have today carried out three drugs warrants in the town.

Controlled drugs and related paraphernalia have been seized with investigations continuing. The seven arrested, aged between 15 and 18 and from the Stoke-on-Trent and Biddulph areas, were all subsequently released on conditional bail whilst enquiries continue.

Chief Inspector Mark Thorley, commander for the Staffordshire Moorlands Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "A dispersal order will remain for the near future and a patrol plan is in place to ensure extra focus is given to the area. Our officers will continue to do what's necessary to keep the Moorlands a safe place to live, work and visit."
