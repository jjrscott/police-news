Three officers that saved the lives of two members of the public have been awarded for their courageous actions.

PC Jenny Bentley and PC Robert Emanuel were searching a wooded area in Stoke-on-Trent after receiving a call from a family who were concerned about their son.

The two response officers, based in Hanley, found the man in an area of open land in Fenton just before 1pm on 17 May 2019 and assisted him before taking to hospital by ambulance.

Whilst on routine patrol, PCSO Sarah Cartlidge also witnessed a man fall from an upper floor window in Stoke-on-Trent on 6 December 2018.

Sarah, from Stoke South Neighbourhood Policing Team, immediately went to help the man just after 2pm who was conscious but badly injured. She provided aid until the ambulance came and took the man to hospital, where he survived.

The three officers received the Royal Humane Society award yesterday (10 March).

Chief Constable Nick Baker said: "I'm immensely proud of the dedication and commitment shown by officers and staff on a daily basis and these three are an example of our officers going that one step further to provide an outstanding service and in some cases, save a life."
