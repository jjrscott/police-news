A teenager from Cannock has been sentenced to 32 months for stabbing another boy in the town.

The 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty to wounding with intent, assault, criminal damage and possession of a weapon.

Stafford Crown Court heard that police were called to Remington Drive just after midday on Monday 1 June to reports of a fight.

Police found a 16-year-old boy who had run into a chip shop in Rumer Hill seeking help. He was being treated by paramedics.

He had been stabbed in the leg, sustaining a deep wound to his left thigh.

The teenage victim said he had met a girl at the railway station and a teenager who was with her had stabbed him.

The offender was identified and chased and detained by members of the public. He was sentenced on 11 August.

The victim made a full recovery.

Detective Inspector Bev Matthews, of Staffordshire Police, said: "Firstly, I'd like to thank those members of the public who gave chase and detained the offender.

"This was an unprovoked and violent assault. It is fortunate that the victim was able to get away and not suffer further injury. We are glad this young offender has been sentenced."
