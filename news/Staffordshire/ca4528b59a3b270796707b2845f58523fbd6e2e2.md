Police are warning people to be extra vigilant on the roads following a number of suspected "crash for cash" incidents in Stoke-on-Trent.

Crash for cash is an insurance fraud tactic which sees someone stage or deliberately cause a road traffic collision solely for financial gain. The car in front will normally brake suddenly for no reason - with some disabling the brake lights to give you little to no warning.

Officers are issuing this warning following a number of reported incidents on the A527 Reginald Mitchell Way over the past week.

Each incident has involved a silver Audi A4 - bearing different number plates - being driven by an Asian male. They all occurred on the same road between 2pm and 4pm on the 24, 25 and 26 February.

We're advising motorists to allow more space for the car in front - particularly at roundabouts - and to make sure they have dash cams installed.

Also be cautious of any driver who seems to already have their insurance details written down following an accident or are claiming to have injuries that are far too severe for the level of impact.

If in doubt then please contact the police from the scene.
