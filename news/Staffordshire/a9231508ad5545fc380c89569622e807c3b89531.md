The offence took place on Staveley Close in Bucknall in the early hours of February 2.

During the burglary a green and black Transition mountain bike was stolen along with carp fishing equipment including six rods, six reels, and green bags containing tackle.

Officers have attended the scene - where the unit is located on a row of garages - and are viewing CCTV from the area. While enquiries are ongoing it is believed a Renault car may have been used during the offence.
