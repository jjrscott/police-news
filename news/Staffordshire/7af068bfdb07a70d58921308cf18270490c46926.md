Staffordshire Police are supporting a nationwide firearms and knife surrender compensation scheme.

The Home Office initiative runs from Thursday 10 December 2020 and concludes on Tuesday 9 March 2021.

New rules under the Offensive Weapons Act 2019 will make it illegal to possess a further 45 items, aside from in certain circumstances.

However, before they are banned, the Act allows for legal owners of these items to hand them over to police and claim compensation for their loss.

The weapons can be surrendered at Longton, Cannock and Burton Police Stations from Monday to Friday, between 9am and 5pm. Leek Police Station is also open from 9am until 1pm on a selected number of Saturdays.

Those handing in certain prohibited items with the relevant paperwork during the three month period will receive at least Â£30 compensation. They will be sent to the Home Office for valuation and organisation of payment direct to the owner. The compensation will not be provided by Staffordshire Police.

Karen Stevenson, Head of the Operations Unit, said: "If you own one of these weapons it's very important you hand it in during the three month period. Weapons must be transported to the police station in a safe way that does not cause alarm to others. And you must adhere to relevant Covid guidelines and obey the instructions on the signage.

"We are asking parents to check if their children have one of the prohibited knives. The surrender supports our ongoing Ditch the Blade campaign, which is a partnership effort to encourage young people to go knife free.

"If you are an owner of a prohibited firearm we will contact you to arrange an appointment for collection."
