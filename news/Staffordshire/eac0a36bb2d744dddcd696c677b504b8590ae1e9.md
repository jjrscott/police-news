We are appealing for information after an incident where commercial power tools valued at about Â£7,000 were taken from a works crew in Stoke-on-Trent.

The incident occurred some time between 2pm and 4pm on Tuesday 8 December. The tools were in a barriered off area on the side of Brundall Oval in Bentilee at the junction with Hethersett Walk where crews were installing broadband equipment.

Witnesses describe seeing two men wearing high-vis jackets pull up in a flat bed truck with Highways maintenance written on the back pull up and put the tools in the van before driving away. The tools reported missing are a breaker pack and gun, a whacker plate and a Stihl saw.

Laura Richards of Staffordshire Police's Hanley Resolution Centre said: "We are appealing for either witnesses to the theft or for anyone who has been offered tools matching the above description to come forward.

"If you have any information or CCTV footage of the incident please get in touch."

The serial number for the breaker pack is MA1136192 and the gun R40110871 if anyone is offered these items for sale.

Anyone with any information or CCTV footage should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 179 of 15 December, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
