Police are appealing for witnesses to a road traffic collision in Sneyd Green on Saturday afternoon.

Officers were called by West Midlands Ambulance Service to Leek New Road at 4.55pm following reports of a collision involving a motorcycle and two pedestrians.

It involved a blue Yamaha motorcycle, which entered the slip road before being in collision with a man and a woman.

A 79-year-old man and a 75-year-old woman, both from Stoke-on-Trent, sustained injuries and were taken to the Royal Stoke University Hospital where they both remain receiving treatment. They are described as being stable.

A 32-year-old man, who was riding the motorcycle, suffered minor injuries and was later treated at hospital.

Officers from the Staffordshire and West Midlands Serious Collision Investigation Unit are appealing for witnesses who may have seen the motorcycle or pedestrians before the collision or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to contact 101, quoting incident 489 of 16 May.
