Staffordshire Police's newest detectives have been training for almost six months.

One of the nine trainee detectives who joined the force includes Emma Holloway, aged 26, from Staffordshire, who was amongst the first cohort of recruits from the national programme, Police Now Detectives.

She started the two-year training and development programme in September 2019 and needed two years' work experience to be eligible - she previously worked for children's services.

Emma demonstrated the strengths and characteristics suited to the role of police detective. This included thriving under pressure, taking a positive attitude to overcome obstacles, responding quickly to new information and being methodical in her approach to solving complex problems.

From September, she was a fully warranted police officers and has completed her initial and highly-intensive 12-weeks of training with more than 85 other trainee detectives from other forces. This involved a mix of classroom-based theoretical training and practical skills development.

She has also completed two months in uniform as a response officer and has now been assigned to a team of detectives, where she is being guided to take full responsibility for investigating offences.

Emma said: "I was attracted to the Police Now Detectives programme as I want to make a positive impact for victims of crime and the community as a whole. I enjoy being faced with different challenges every day and everyone has been so supportive and welcoming."

Detective Chief Inspector Steve Smith, Staffordshire Police's lead for Police Now Detectives, said: "The Police Now Detective programme offers trainees a unique opportunity to make a positive impact in society. It also offers the change to contribute to the excellent work already being done up and down the country by colleagues already working in policing.

Additional officers will be recruited into Staffordshire Police in 2020/21, as part of the national Uplift programme. For more information and to apply, visit https://www.staffordshire.police.uk/police-forces/staffordshire-police/areas/staffordshire-police/campaigns/2019/job-like-no-other/
