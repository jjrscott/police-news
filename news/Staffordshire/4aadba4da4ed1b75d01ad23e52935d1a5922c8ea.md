Officers from Staffordshire Police are investigating a robbery in Burslem.

At around 5pm on Thursday 2 April police were called to reports of a robbery on Newcastle Street, near to the McColls store.

The victim - a 21-year-old man - had just used a cash machine when he was approached by two men who demanded money.

He was chased and grabbed before being thrown to the floor and assaulted. Members of the public intervened but the offenders made off with a quantity of cash.

The victim sustained minor injuries and was left understandably shaken by the incident.

Two 16-year-old boys from Stoke-on-Trent were later arrested on suspicion of robbery. They have been released on conditional bail pending further enquiries.

Detectives are appealing for anyone in the area who witnessed the incident, or anyone with dash-cam footage from Newcastle Street to come forward and speak to officers.

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 quoting incident number 457 of 02 April, or email david.stubbs@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk
