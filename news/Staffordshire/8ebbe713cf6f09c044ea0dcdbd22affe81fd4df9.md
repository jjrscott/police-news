Police officers, police staff and paramedics who played in a charity rugby match last month raised more than £2,000 for Birmingham Children's Hospital.

Staffordshire Police and West Midlands Ambulance Service took part in the 'John Quilty Cup' at Stafford Rugby Club on Friday 6 March. The match ended in a 27-13 win for Staffordshire Police.

The event celebrated two special people to Staffordshire Police - Detective Inspector John Quilty, of Force CID South, who is receiving cancer treatment, and Milly Hill, the daughter of Detective Constable Emma Hill, who sadly died in 2015.

John first worked with Emma in 2017. She has raised more than £120,000 for the Magic of Milly charity, named after her daughter, which raises funds for Birmingham Children's Hospital. Milly was born with a rare congenital condition, which resulted in her spending lots of time in hospital. She was admitted to the hospital for heart surgery in 2015 but sadly, despite the best efforts of staff, Milly suffered complications after the operation and died the night before her second birthday.

Detective Inspector Adrian Webb, from Force CID North, who helped to organise the match, said: "We are very pleased to have raised just over £2,000 for the Magic of Milly charity. These are much-needed funds for Birmingham Children's Hospital.

"Staffordshire Police's rugby section has now raised almost £4,000 for charity, with the most recent game against Cheshire Police raising £500."

PC Elliot Waller, rugby captain, from the Northern Response Hub, said: "As a team we were honoured to be able to be a part of helping such a worthy cause, alongside some great people.

"We'd like to thank West Midlands Ambulance Service for agreeing to be part of it too, as we look to make the 'John Quilty Cup' an annual event with them."
