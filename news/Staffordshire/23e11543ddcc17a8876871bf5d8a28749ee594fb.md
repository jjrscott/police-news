The family of a man who died in Stoke-on-Trent have paid tribute to him.

Keith Robert Rowlands, 44, was found in cardiac arrest at his Smallthorne home on Saturday 19 December. He was taken to hospital but sadly died later that day.

In a statement, Mr Rowland's family said: "Keith was a big softie who loved life and everyone around him, always up for a laugh and a brew. He loved his family and friends, his dog, going fishing, watching football and the city of Liverpool. He will always be missed by so many whose lives he touched."

A post-mortem examination has taken place but further tests are required.

A 27-year-old man, from Stoke-on-Trent remains on conditional bail while inquiries continue.
