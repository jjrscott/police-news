Updated News Post

Officers from Staffordshire Police have called off the search for missing person David Wright, who was last seen in Clifton Campville, Tamworth, on Monday (10 February).

Sadly, the body of a man, believed to be 60-year-old David, was found this afternoon (Friday 14 February) during a search of the area.

His family have been informed and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.

We would like to thank colleagues, partner agencies and the public for their assistance and support during the search.

Formal identification will take place in due course. Detectives do not believe there are any suspicious circumstances and a report will be prepared for HM Coroner.
