We have been made aware of social media posts circulating in relation to a proposed gathering in Burslem Park on Saturday.

In response our officers have spoken to those behind the original posts and reminded them of the current Covid-19 restrictions in place and the reasons why such gatherings can not take place.
We will also have patrols in the area to respond to anyone who goes against the current guidelines and attempts to congregate in the park.
At this time we would also ask for parents to be aware of where there children are so they do not breach the clear national guidelines.
