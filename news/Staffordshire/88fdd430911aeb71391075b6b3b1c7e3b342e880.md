A Stafford man who was caught with wraps of heroin in a supermarket car park in the town centre has been jailed for 45 months.

Dean Holland, aged 31, of Glover Street, was jailed at Stafford Crown Court on Wednesday (Jan 22) after admitting possession with intent to supply heroin.

He also admitted possession of cannabis.

The court heard that Holland was cycling when he was stopped and searched by officers at 1.30pm on 3 December in Sainsbury's car park, in Chell Road.

Holland was not compliant during the search and while he was being restrained on the floor he was witnessed throwing away a plastic egg containing multiple deals of class A drugs.

A mobile phone was also recovered from Holland which contained messages about deals on it.

Sergeant Tom Fotherby, of Stafford Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "The team at Stafford has already secured four convictions for drugs offences this year.

"We will continue to strive to bring dealers before the courts."
