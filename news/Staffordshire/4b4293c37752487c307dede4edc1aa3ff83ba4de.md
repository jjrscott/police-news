Detectives are appealing for witnesses after two teenagers were arrested following reports of an attack on a 19-year-old man in Burslem.

The victim had been walking on Scotia Road near Dimensions Leisure Centre shortly after 8pm on Tuesday 15 September when it's reported he was approached by a group - who have proceeded to taking his keys and coat aware from him.

Having initially managed to get away, the victim was followed and struck over the head with what's believed to be a machete. He was taken to hospital with a serious slash wound to his head. He has since recovered.

Two men - aged 18 and 19 and from Burslem - have been arrested on suspicion of robbery and wounding with intent. They have released under investigation.

Detective Constable Dave Stubbs from force CID said: "We received a number of reports about incidents in the Burslem area last week and we believe they are linked.

"I am appealing for anyone who may have seen what happened or who has any information to please come forward.

"We know a large kitchen style knife was disposed of in a gutter opposite Dimensions shortly afterwards and we're asking the person(s) who picked that up to get in touch immediately as we expect this was used in the assault."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 281 of 16 September, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
