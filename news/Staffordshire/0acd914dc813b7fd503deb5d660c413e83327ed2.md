An elderly couple were threatened and assaulted by burglars who stole a safe from their house in Stoke-on-Trent.

Detectives are appealing for witnesses to the incident which took place in Vinebank Street, Penkhull, at around 5pm yesterday (6 January).

Three men forced entry to the address, via the front door and set about forcibly removing a small safe.

The elderly female occupant challenged the men and was restrained by her arm.

Another offender held the downstairs shower room door closed, to prevent the male occupant from getting out of the room. Once the safe was removed, the men ran off.

Anyone with information is urged to contact Staffordshire Police via social media or 101 referring to incident 477 of 6 January.
