Updated News Post

Detectives investigating the murder of a woman in Stoke-on-Trent have today named her as Ann Wendy Morse, aged 71.

Wendy (as she was known) was found at her home in Tunstall Road, Knypersley, just after 7pm on Sunday 22 March.

Detective Inspector Cheryl Hannan, senior investigating officer, said: "Although she has not yet been formally identified, officers sadly believe it to be Wendy. Her death is being treated as suspicious and a post mortem will take place to establish how she died.

"Specially-trained officers are currently with Wendy's family to offer support at this difficult time."

DI Hannan added: "Officers went to the address on Sunday following concerns from her family, as they were unable to contact her. Enquiries are currently ongoing into her death and detectives are continuing to carry out forensic examinations at the scene and house-to-house enquiries. Local neighbourhood officers are also in the area to carry out reassurance patrols.

"We need to hear from anyone who has any information."

Please share any information by calling 101, quoting incident number 481 of 22 March.
