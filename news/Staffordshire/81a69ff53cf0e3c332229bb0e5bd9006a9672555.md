A senior police officer has appealed to cyclists to stop travelling to the Staffordshire countryside during the COVID-19 outbreak and to stay at home and cycle in their local areas.

With warm weather expected this weekend Staffordshire Police's force lead on rural and wildlife crime Chief Inspector Mark Thorley has reinforced the call for the public to avoid travelling to the countryside.

Chief Inspector Thorley, who is area commander for Staffordshire Moorlands, said: "We understand that in the warmer weather it can be tempting for people to think they can visit parkland and heathland such as Cannock Chase or the Roaches, but we're asking people to stay at home.

"There was initially some confusion around exercising but people should only be exercising near their homes and not travelling - in some cases very long distances - to the countryside."

Chief Inspector Thorley said that there had been reports of cyclists and mountain bikers travelling to rural areas in Staffordshire.

"We don't want people to come here to cycle during this outbreak. This is really important to avoid people congregating at car parks, laybys or beauty spots."

He said the majority of people in Staffordshire had complied with the government regulations.

"Our approach is very much to work with our communities, but we don't want a small minority to risk further spread of COVID-19."

"We all need to work together to prevent the spread of Covid-19, protect the NHS and save lives. Thank you for your support in staying at home and avoiding unnecessary travel. The beautiful Staffordshire countryside will still be there in a few weeks for us all to enjoy."
