There has been an increase in overnight crime involving sheds, vehicles and businesses in the Christchurch area of Stone.

We have increased patrols and are taking every opportunity to take positive action.

Last week we arrested three men on suspicion of theft and we will continue to target people involved in crime in Stone.

We are aware of a social media page 'Policing the streets of Stone' and we do not want members of the public confronting others due to the potential risks of doing this.

If you see anything concerning or suspicious call 999.

Anyone with information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
