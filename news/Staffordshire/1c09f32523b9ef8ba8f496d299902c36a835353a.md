A 74-year-old man's seen his jail term extended after being found guilty of nine counts of historical sexual assault offences against a child in Staffordshire.

Ivan Keeling, from Cheadle, was found guilty of sexual assaulting a girl, aged between 11 and 14, between 2011 and 2014 on Wednesday 3 March following a trial at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court.

He was also found guilty of inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity, sexually assaulting a child under 16 and inciting a child under 16 to engage in sexual activity.

Keeling, who is currently serving 17 years for an unrelated offence, will now see a further four years added after being sentenced earlier today (Thursday 11 March).

Detective Inspector Zoe Kelsall, from the force's Rape and Serious Sexual Offences, unit said: "We are really happy with the sentence passed to Keeling and we hope it brings some form of closure to the victim - who has shown tremendous bravery and courage throughout to help us bring the case to the courts.

"This is one of a few recent historical sexual assault cases where we have managed to achieve strong sentences against those responsible and we hope it sends a real message to anyone committing these crime.

"We will always continue to do whatever is necessary to bring those responsible for these heinous crimes to justice, whilst ensuring the victims and their families are given the support they need."

Anyone who has suffered sexual abuse, or suspects others may be subject to sexual abuse, is urged to contact Staffordshire Police on 101.
