We are appealing for information over a string of incidents where cars have been damaged on and around Hudson Close in Heath Hayes.

The incidents, taking place over 10 days, are believed to have been carried out by one offender. Witnesses report seeing a young male, possibly aged between 11 and 15, on a pedal bike in the street acting suspiciously during the days in question.

Cars are being scratched by what is believed to be a key.

The first incident occurred on Sunday 8 November when a resident on Attingham Drive reported a smiley face had been scratched into the bonnet of their Skoda car.

The next incidents came on Monday 9 November on Hudson Close when a resident reported letters had been scratched into their Land Rover Discovery. On the same day, another resident of the same street reported that expletives had been scratched into their Vauxhall Corsa. A similar occurrence was also reported by the owner of a Ford Galaxy on Hudson Close on the same day.

Then on Thursday 19 November, another resident reported that expletives had been scratched into both the windscreen and side window of their Honda CR-V EX I-VTEC.

Witnesses say they also saw a boy of the same description possibly throwing stones towards cars on Hudson Close on the same day as some of the incidents took place.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 487 of 19 November, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
