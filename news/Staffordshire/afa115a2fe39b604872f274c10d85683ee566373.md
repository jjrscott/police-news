A Stafford man has been jailed for 14 months after being caught intending to supply monkey dust.

Steven Dawkins, aged 28, of Merrivale Road, Rising Brook, was jailed at Stafford Crown Court.

The court heard that Dawkins was stopped by officers in Greengate Street in Stafford town centre on 29 May 2018. He was searched and 4.1 grams of monkey dust, a class B drug was seized.

Dawkins pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply the drug.

Sergeant Tom Fotherby, of Stafford Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "The team has been working very hard and we have secured a number of convictions for those intending to supply drugs in Stafford in recent months.

"We want to send out a clear message that we will bring dealers before the courts."

He was sentenced on 2 January.

Dawkins' co-defendant Morgan Bailey, aged 22, and also of Merrivale Road, pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply cannabis after he was caught with 64.2 grams by officers in the town centre.

He will be sentenced on 31 January.
