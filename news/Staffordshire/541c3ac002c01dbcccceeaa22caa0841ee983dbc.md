A man claiming to work for the Coastguard was stopped on the M6 in Staffordshire last night for having fake emergency lighting on his car.

At around 8pm last night (9 September) officers from the Central Motorway Police Group (CMPG) spotted a silver Ford Mondeo travelling on the M6 through Stafford (junction 14) with emergency lighting strobes on at the front and rear of the vehicle.

Officers approached with their blue lights on and the Mondeo driver switched his off and drove at speeds of up to 95mph in a 60mph limit area.

The car was stopped at Keele Services where the 34-year-old from Blackpool claimed to work for the Coastguard and said he was responding to a call out in Blackpool. Checks confirmed he did not work for the Coastguard or any other authority, was not responding to an incident and had travelled from Oxfordshire using the emergency lights.

The man was reported for summons for excess speed and for using a vehicle with blue beacons in a prohibited manner.
