Dozens of motorists were caught ignoring the speed limit during a crackdown in North Staffordshire.

Staffordshire Police's Road Policing Unit carried out the operation on Whitmore Road - close to the junction with Greenway - in Trentham on Monday morning following concerns being raised by local residents.

And in an hour-and-a-half 30 motorists were caught out exceeding the 30mph limit. The quickest speed recorded was 54mph.

PC Jim Hunt, of the force's road policing unit, is urging motorists to stick to the speed limit. He said: "This operation was carried out in response to concerns being raised by local residents.

"Whitmore Road is a busy stretch and this section has a limit of 30mph and runs directly through a residential area. It was disappointing to see so many people ignoring this limit and they will be receiving a notice through the post.

"Our message is very simple - slow down and obey the limit. Limits are in place for a reason and speeding remains one of the major factors behind fatal collisions. These operations are done to help keep our roads safe and we will continue to identify areas proactively along with responding to concerns raised by families."
