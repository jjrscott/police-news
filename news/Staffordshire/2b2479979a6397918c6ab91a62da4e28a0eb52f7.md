A man has been arrested for drug and driving offences after being stopped by officers in Tamworth.

At about 12.30pm yesterday (7 December) officers spotted a white Audi A3 acting suspiciously.

The driver, aged 28 and from Walsall, pulled over in Manor Road in Mile Oak, Tamworth, and was detained walking away from the vehicle. He was found to have two mobile phones and cash on him. He was also found to hold a revoked driving license and no insurance.

A search of his home address in Walsall uncovered a small cannabis growing operation and associated paraphernalia.

He was arrested for being concerned in the production of a controlled Class B drug (cannabis), being concerned in the supply of a Class A drug, driving a motor vehicle without a licence and driving without motor insurance.

He has since been released under investigation as enquiries continue.
