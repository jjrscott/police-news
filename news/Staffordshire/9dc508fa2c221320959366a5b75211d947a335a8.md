Neighbourhood officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward as they look to track down a stolen bike.

A women's white and pink CUBE mountain bike was stolen from a garage on Chell Green Avenue in Fegg Hayes at some point during the evening of January 17.

Officers believe the thief may have been watching the property and looking for an opportunity to take the bike as the homeowner was around the address at the time.

The bike would also have needed to have been pushed or carried due to both tyres being flat.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 0251 of January 18, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
