Kind-hearted motorway officers clubbed together hundreds of pounds worth of donations for staff at Royal Stoke University Hospital.

Officers from Central Motorway Police Group (CMPG) held their own collection to raise money to buy food, flowers and treats for staff on the frontline.

A total of Â£575 was raised by officers from CMPG, their families and colleagues from partner agencies such as Highways England.

Staff from the hospital were left teary when the team handed over the treats on Thursday (16 April) during the weekly 8pm #clapforcarers celebrations.

Sergeant Rob Powell, from Central Motorway Policing Group, said: "This is an unprecedented time and the NHS are facing it head-on. These donations were a bit of relief for them and something to take their mind off things.

"Some of the staff came out during the clap but it especially moving when we looked up to see staff on the wards and patients clapping with us.

"The looks on their faces - they looked like they'd won a million pounds!

"We're all working to help each other in these testing times and we'll continue to do all we can to support our communities."
