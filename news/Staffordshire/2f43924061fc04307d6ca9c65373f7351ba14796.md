We are appealing for information over a robbery that saw a shop owner threatened with a knife in Tamworth.

Officers attended a shop on Pennymoor Road at about 8.25pm on Thursday (November 5), after reports of a robbery by an offender carrying a knife.

The offender is described as male, approximately 5 ft 6" tall and of slim build, who was wearing a dark top with a grey hood, dark trousers and gloves, with a surgical mask covering their face.

He was said to be holding a knife during the incident and threatened the shop owner without any physical interaction.

The shop owner also described seeing a second male watching from by the door. They were described as approximately 5 ft 8" tall, also of slim build and wearing dark clothing. He also had a surgical mask on and something dark covering his head.

They escaped on foot with cash, cigarettes and rolling tobacco.

The shop had CCTV which is being scoured by officers, but they are also seeking those in the area at the time who may have seen or heard anything.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 785 of November 5, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
