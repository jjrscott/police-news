A 23-year-old man, from Stoke-on-Trent, was arrested on suspicion of production of cannabis. He was later released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Sergeant Chris Moss, deputy commander at Stoke-on-Trent South Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "I am always pleased to see illegal ventures such as this shut down. We have stopped these drugs from going out into our community.

"These set-ups are often unsafe and therefore seeing this one stopped is an excellent result."
