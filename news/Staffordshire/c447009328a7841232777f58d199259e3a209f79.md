A serving prisoner has been jailed for 10 years after stabbing a prison officer in the chest.

Michael Casey, 22, of Her Majesty's Prison and Young Offenders' Institution Swinfen Hall, was sentenced to 10 years and nine months imprisonment at Stafford Crown Court on Thursday 15 October after pleading guilty to Section 18 wounding.

On 30 August 2019, at approximately 8.50am following morning exercise, the prisoners were returning to their cells. Casey was on the first floor sat on a pool table when the prison officer asked him to return to his cell. As the prison officer turned away Casey stabbed him in the right side of his chest with a blade attached to a highlighter pen.

The prison officer's injuries were not serious and he was able to leave hospital later the same day. However, during the summing up the judge took into account the psychological effect this had had on the officer.

Police Constable Julie Walker, of the prison crime investigation team, said: "I hope that this sentence will serve as a strong deterrent as individuals will be held accountable for their behaviour, as well as providing reassurance that these types of incidents are treated with the utmost seriousness and severity."
