A Stafford man has been jailed for two years after burgling several houses in the town.

Deven Patel-Reddy, from Brocton, pleaded guilty to five counts of burglary and two counts of attempted burglary and was sentenced at Stafford Crown Court on Friday (November 15).

In December the 18-year-old smashed the window of the first property he broke into in Brocton and stole thousands of pounds worth of electrical items including an iPad, Sony laptop and camera equipment. He also took valuable jewellery and bottles of alcohol and damaged several other items within the house.

Patel-Reddy went on to break into four other properties in the area between December 2018 and March 2019, by smashing windows and patio doors and stealing alcohol and cigarettes which were later found on him by officers. A knife and blood was found in one of the homes and DNA evidence linked them to Patel-Reddy.

The defendant attempted to commit burglaries at two other addresses and was spotted climbing through a bathroom window by one of the victims who was home at the time.

Patel-Reddy was interviewed by officers and admitted to breaking into the properties to steal alcohol and other items.

Detective Constable Daniel Champeau said: "We are glad to see a serial offender taken off the streets. He broke into several homes within the area, causing distress to those living within the properties and stealing valuable items whilst causing serious damage. These crimes are serious offences and will not be tolerated in Staffordshire."
