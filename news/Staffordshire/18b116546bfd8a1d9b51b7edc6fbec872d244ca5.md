Detectives are investigating an attempted sexual assault on a woman in Burslem last month.

Just after midnight on Sunday 16 August, police were called to reports that an 18-year-old woman had been approached by a man in an alleyway to the side of Barber Street in Burslem.

He allegedly pulled her trousers down and exposed himself. The offender was disturbed by someone else in the alleyway and rode away on a dark-coloured BMX bike.

The man is described as Eastern European or Asian who has a foreign accent, aged in his mid to late 20s, approximately 5ft 9ins tall and of a skinny build. He has short dark hair with a short beard and wears round, thin-framed glasses. He was wearing black and white checked shorts, black zip-up jacket with white sleeves and a black baseball cap.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 25 of 16 August, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
