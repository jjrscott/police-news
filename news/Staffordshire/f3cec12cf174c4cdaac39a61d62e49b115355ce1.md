Officers have called off the search for missing person Phillip Murphy, who was last seen in Tamworth on Thursday 2 April.

Sadly, the body of a man, believed to be 60-year-old Phillip, was found late this morning (Saturday 11 April) at Borrowpit Lake in Tamworth.

His family have been informed and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.

We would like to thank colleagues, partner agencies and the public for their assistance and support during the search.

Formal identification will take place in due course. Detectives do not believe there are any suspicious circumstances and a report will be prepared for HM Coroner.
