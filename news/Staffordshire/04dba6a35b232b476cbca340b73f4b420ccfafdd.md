The family of a woman who died after she was stabbed at her home in Burslem on Friday have paid tribute to her.

Kimberley Deakin's family have said: "The family cannot express in words their sorrow and pain at losing their beloved Kim. She was kind, caring and loved by many. Kim had recently become an adoring mother to Ava and can never be replaced in our hearts. We would like to ask for privacy to be allowed to grieve in peace."

They are being supported by specially-trained officers at this time.

Lewis Crofts, 29, of Lytchett Drive, Broadstone, Dorset, appeared at the North Staffordshire Justice Centre charged with Kimberley's murder this morning and has been remanded in custody. He will appear at Stafford Crown Court on Wednesday 11 November.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 430 of 6 November, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
