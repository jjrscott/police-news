An operation aimed at tackling shoplifting in Lichfield city centre over the festive period has launched this week following the success of previous years.

Operation Citadel, first launched by another PCSO in Lichfield in 2017, has been reinstated ahead of Black Friday and Christmas to target those shoplifters. Over the last 12 months, shoplifting in the city centre has fallen 16%.

Lichfield PCSO Alyx Hart, who is running this year's operation, said: "Operation Citadel is back again to target shoplifters over the Christmas period following previous increases of reports in the city and concerns from retailers.

"There will be an increase in uniformed patrols around the city centre and we'll be working with Lichfield CCTV operators and shop owners to ensure everyone has a peaceful Christmas."
