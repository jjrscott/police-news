Two men have been arrested following a break-in at a convenience store in Kings Bromley during the early hours of this morning (12 November).

During the incident, the alarm at the Co-Op on Manor Road was activated by intruders, as they forced entry and attempted to steal cigarettes at around 2.25am.

Officers attended within minutes, and arrested two men from Birmingham at the scene. A suspected stolen BMW was also recovered.

An 18-year-old was arrested on suspicion of burglary and theft, and a 24-year-old was arrested on suspicion of burglary and possession of a controlled drug.

They both remain in police custody at this time and enquiries are continuing this morning.
