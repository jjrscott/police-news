Detectives are becoming increasingly concerned for a mother and her two children after they went missing from a Travelodge in Newcastle.

Hajar Mohammed (Al-Shammani), 35-years-old, who was heavily pregnant at the time, and her daughters Reem, aged eight, and Marjam, aged six, were last seen in Lower Street at approximately 5.30pm on Tuesday 10 September. Despite enquiries being made by our Missing Person Enquiry Team, the family has not been located. Detectives from Force CID are now investigating and want help to locate the family to ensure they are safe and well.

Hajar is described as being 5ft 3ins tall, of Middle Eastern appearance and was heavily pregnant when she was last seen. She was wearing a beige head scarf and a black floor-length dress.

Marjam and Reem were last seen wearing matching clothing including a pink and light-grey rain coat, a grey t-shirt with unicorn details, light-blue jeans with a unicorn at the top of left leg and trainers that matched their coats.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 304 of 12 September, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
