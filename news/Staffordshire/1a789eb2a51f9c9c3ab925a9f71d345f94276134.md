Detectives are appealing for information after an aggravated burglary at a property in Newcastle.

Officers were called to the Keele Road area shortly before 10pm on Wednesday 3 March.

High value items and jewellery were stolen after four men broke into the property and forced the victim and her child into the bathroom.

The men then made off before the victim contacted police. She and her child were assessed at the scene by paramedics and were thankfully uninjured.

Local enquiries, including the assessment of nearby CCTV, is taking place alongside a forensic examination.

Detective Sergeant Abigail Shore from CID North said: "This was a highly distressing incident for both the victim and her daughter. We are determined to find those responsible and we're asking anyone with any information to get in touch as soon as possible."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 718 of 3 March, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
