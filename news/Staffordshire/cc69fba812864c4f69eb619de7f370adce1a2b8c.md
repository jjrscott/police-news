A man has been charged following a road traffic collision and disorder in Chesterton.

At around 11pm on Saturday night (31 October) officers were called to two incidents in the area - a disturbance involving groups carrying weapons on Palatine Drive and a non-stop collision on Loomer Road.

A 25-year-old man of no fixed address, has now been charged with Section 18 assault (grievous bodily harm with intent) and causing serious injury by dangerous driving.

He has been remanded in custody to appear before magistrates this morning (Monday 2 November).

A 16-year-old boy, a 21-year-old woman and a 22-year-old man, arrested at the scene, have since been released on conditional bail pending further enquires.

A 24-year-old man remains in hospital in a critical but stable condition.

Detectives are continuing to appeal for any witnesses or anyone with information to come forward and message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 1031 of 31 October, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
