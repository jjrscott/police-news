A second man from Warwickshire has been charged in connection with a series of robberies following reports of carjacking incidents in south Staffordshire.

Jamie Brunton, aged 20, of Shustoke, near Coleshill, is charged with conspiracy to rob between 28 October 2020 and 20 November 2020.

He appeared before magistrates in Newcastle-under-Lyme yesterday and was remanded to appear at Stafford Crown Court at a date to be confirmed.

His co-accused is Keir Carter, 19, of Coleshill, who was charged in November with conspiracy to rob between the same dates. He was also remanded.

The alleged offences relate to a series of aggravated burglaries and robberies of cars which took place in the Tamworth, Lichfield, Warwickshire and Leicestershire areas.
