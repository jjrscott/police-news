Police are appealing for witnesses to an assault in Tamworth - after a man was left with serious head injuries.

The 24-year-old victim, from Tamworth, was at Colehill in the town centre when he was punched in the face in the early hours of Sunday (5 January).

Detectives say there were many people in the area at the time so are asking them to come forward.

A 21-year-old man from Tamworth was arrested on suspicion of inflicting GBH without intent and possession of a controlled Class A drug. He's been released under investigation.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 112 of 5 January, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
