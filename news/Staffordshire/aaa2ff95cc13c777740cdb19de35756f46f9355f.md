A magistrates' extension was granted to detectives from Staffordshire Police this morning at North Staffordshire Justice Centre in Newcastle-under-Lyme.

Detectives have been granted an extension to continue questioning a Tamworth man arrested on suspicion of murder.

A magistrates' extension was granted to detectives from Staffordshire Police this morning (Sept 21) at North Staffordshire Justice Centre in Newcastle-under-Lyme.

A 19-year-old man was arrested on September 19 after a woman's body was discovered in woodland in Roman Way, Tamworth.

Although the woman has not been formally identified, she is believed to be Keeley Bunker, 20, of Tamworth, who was reported missing earlier in the evening of September 19.

We are still investigating the cause of death.

We thank the community for their support and would like to request that the privacy of Keeley's family is respected and that people refrain from speculating about the circumstances around her death.

 Anyone with information about the case is urged to contact Staffordshire Police. Information and footage can be uploaded, anonymously if required, via this link - https://mipp.police.uk/operation/STAFFS19F18-PO1
