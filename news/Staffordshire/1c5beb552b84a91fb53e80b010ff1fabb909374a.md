Detectives from Staffordshire Police have released an e-fit of a suspect they want to speak to in connection with a distraction burglary in Shareshill, Wolverhampton.

At around 8pm on Monday 9 September a man approached an elderly homeowner on School Lane, claiming that he was looking for a lost kitten.

He entered the house uninvited, and convinced the resident to go into the garden to help search for the kitten.

After he left, the victim discovered that a second person had entered his property, and completed an untidy search of a bedroom before making off with an assortment of mixed currency.

The man is described as white, around 50-years-old, 5ft 5ins - 5ft 6ins tall, of a medium build with dark hair and stubble. He had an Irish accent and wore dark coloured work wear. It is believed that he left the area in a white car.

Investigations are on-going and anyone that recognises the man in the e-fit or has any other information about the burglary is asked to email matthew.burton@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk quoting incident number 717 of 09 September.
