A charity challenge has taken place in memory of Staffordshire police officer Luke Van De Sande, who sadly lost his life in a motorbike collision last year.

Earlier today (25 November) his friend and colleague, Mike Morris, ran 30km from his home in Newcastle-under-Lyme to police headquarters in Stafford, before starting a nine-hour shift as a Control Room Operator!

He completed the challenge in just under 2 hours and 25 minutes, and has raised over Â£600 so far for Luke's Legacy - Docbike Staffordshire.

Mike said: "Luke was a very special friend, a true inspiration and touched the lives of so many people. I wanted to support the vital work of Docbike by taking on this challenge to fundraise.

"I chose today - the 25th November - to complete the run before my shift as Luke's radio call sign was 'NC25' so the perfect date to do something crazy for Luke.

"Thank you to everyone who has made a donation so far and shared my fundraising page. Every single penny will help this wonderful cause in Luke's memory."

Control Room Managers, David Fynn and Beth Windsor, added: "We are all incredibly proud of Mike and it was fantastic to see him arrive at HQ and cross the 'finish line' - in a great time too!

"Luke is greatly missed by everyone he worked with here at Staffordshire Police and his colleagues will continue to support his family and friends by fundraising and donating in aid of Luke's Legacy."
