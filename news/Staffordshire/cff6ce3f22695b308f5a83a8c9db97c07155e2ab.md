Police are urging people to be vigilant after a woman had more than Â£500 stolen from her house in Tamworth in a distraction burglary.

The 83-year-old victim was at her home in St George's Way in Glascote at around 2:30pm on Sunday (5 January) when she answered the door to a man who had asked to use her phone as his dog had been run over in the street.

When the woman had gone out into the street she noticed the man had gone with her purse - which contained hundreds of pounds in cash, a prescription and a photo of her husband.

The suspect is described as approximately late 30s, with an Irish accent, facial stubble and wearing a dark-coloured jacket. He's also described as carrying a small terrier dog.
