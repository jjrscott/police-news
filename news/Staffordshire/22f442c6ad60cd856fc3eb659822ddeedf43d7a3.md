A 30-year-old man, from Crewe, has been jailed after being convicted of a string of offences across Staffordshire and Cheshire.

Mark Hudson, of Derrington Avenue, pleaded guilty of 23 charges, including two counts of burglary and six counts of theft from a motor vehicle.

He has now been sentenced to 32 months in prison after appearing at Chester Crown Court on Friday 5 March.

During one incident on 3 September 2020, Hudson entered his victim's room at a hotel on King Street, Longton, before stealing his phone and wallet. Hudson was detained immediately by officers and later released under investigation.

A few days later, he targeted a number of vehicles on separate occasions in Stoke-on-Trent. He stole cash and bank cards before being arrested for a second time.

Sergeant Marc Proctor, from Staffordshire Police, said: "Hudson's offences were plentiful and each one had a profound impact on those targeted.

"We worked hard, alongside colleagues at Cheshire Police, to ensure we went to the Crown Prosecution Service with the best possible case against Hudson and we're really pleased with the sentence he's been handed.

"We hope it acts as a stern warning for anyone looking to carry out similar offences in our county or those we border."
