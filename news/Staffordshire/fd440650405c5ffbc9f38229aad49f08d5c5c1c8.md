Detectives are investigating the death of a man who was found in cardiac arrest at a property in Smallthorne.

Officers were called to Nellan Crescent at about 5am on Saturday 19 December.

The man, who officers have named as Keith Robert Rowlands, aged 44, was taken to hospital by the ambulance service but sadly died later that day.

A post-mortem examination was carried out yesterday (Sunday 20 December) and delivered an inconclusive result. Further tests will be carried out.

A 27-year-old man, from Stoke-on-Trent, arrested on 19 December on suspicion of murder, has been released on bail while inquiries continue.

Detective Inspector Alan Lyford, of the force's Major Investigations Department, said: "We would like to reassure the community that we believe this was an isolated incident.

"We are in the early stages of the investigation and would like to hear from anyone with any information.

"Keith's family are being supported by specially-trained officers and they ask for their privacy to be respected at this tragic time."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Staffordshire Police on Facebook, Twitter, or call 101, quoting incident number 130 of 19 December. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 111 555.
