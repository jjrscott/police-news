Hundreds of people attended the Black Lives Matter protest in Hanley Park this afternoon (June 4).

We want to thank those who attended for expressing their views in a peaceful manner.

Our neighbourhood policing team were in attendance and reminded those present of social distancing guidelines, which were observed by the majority.

As we work together to prevent the spread of Covid-19 we would prefer it if gatherings did not take place, but we respect the right of others to peacefully protest.

With further protests planned across the county we urge people to keep in mind the virus is still a major threat and we all have a role and civic duty in protecting the NHS and saving lives - everyone is at risk from this virus including our family and friends.

Crowds dispersed at around 6.30pm.
