Officers are appealing for witnesses after a teenager was threatened with a knife and pushed off his bike in Burton-on-Trent.

Staffordshire Police received a report of a robbery that took place under a railway bridge along Moor Street in Burton-on-Trent at around 10.30pm on 13 November.

The youth, who was cycling home at the time, was approached by two men armed with a knife and a hammer. The 15-year-old's bike, card and tobacco was taken.

Investigative Officer Richard Kinsella, from East Staffordshire Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "This was an unprovoked attack on a teenager who was simply making his way home.

"Thankfully, he was unharmed. Enquiries are on-going but we are now asking the public to come forward with any information that may assist with our investigation.

"Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting incident number 21 of 13 November or direct message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter.

"Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
