A man from Cobridge has been jailed after he was caught with thousands of pounds worth of Class A drugs in Stoke-on-Trent.

24-year-old Rigers Lleshanaku, of Waterloo Road, Cobridge, was arrested after his car was stopped by officers from the Central Motorway Policing Group on Bilton Street, Stoke shortly before 5pm on Tuesday 18 August.

Having searched the vehicle, officers found cocaine - with a potential value of £4000 - hidden inside a coffee bag, as well as £645 in cash. This was all forfeited under Section 27 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.

On Tuesday 13 October, Lleshanaku was sentenced at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court to two years in prison having pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply class A drugs and driving without insurance.

Sergeant Marc Proctor from the force's Stoke South Neighbourhood Policing Team said: "This sentencing is further proof of the great work our officers are doing in combatting those intent on circulating drugs around our communities.

"Lleshanaku was detained after decisive work and had no choice but to admit to his role in supplying a large amount of Class A drugs.

"My message to those who continue to bring drugs onto our streets is simple - we will continue to stamp out what you're doing and, if found guilty, you will be prosecuted."
