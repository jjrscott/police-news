Two drug dealers from Birmingham have each been sentenced to 30 months for supplying heroin and cocaine in Cannock and Rugeley.

Pierre Pool and Jordan Hoo, both aged 26, were handed their jail terms on March 13 at Stafford Crown Court after they pleaded guilty to supplying Class A drugs.

The pair were arrested on 17 July 2018 after police officers stopped Pool's vehicle in Rugeley and found a number of wraps of heroin and cocaine along with cash and burner phones which contained messages relating to the supply of drugs.

Pool's and Hoo's properties in College Road, Moseley, and Green Lane, Small Heath, were then searched and more Class A drugs were found along with phones, scales and razor blades.

The defendants were involved in a county lines drug supply enterprise called 'The Lewi Line' where they would travel from Birmingham on a regular basis to deal Class A drugs within Staffordshire.

Detective Constable Ian McDonack, of Staffordshire Police, said: "This was a significant operation whereby heroin and cocaine was sold on the streets of south Staffordshire. We have a zero tolerance to County Lines drug dealing and I hope the sentences handed out to Pool and Hoo sends out a clear message to other potential dealers that this will not be tolerated in Staffordshire"

Anyone with any information about drug dealing in their community should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter or call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
