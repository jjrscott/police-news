Two men have been jailed for raping a woman in Newcastle last year.

Alexander Browalski, 36, of Lymedale Suites, Liverpool Road, Newcastle, was jailed for seven and a half years at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court today (10 March). He pleaded guilty to rape at an earlier hearing.

Olgun Ramazan, 43, of Lymedale Suites, Liverpool Road, Newcastle, was jailed for 10 years. He was found guilty of assisting rape at the same court on 25 February.

Ramazan and Browalski were arrested at their home addresses on 17 March 2019 following reports that a 19-year-old woman had been raped at a property on Liverpool Road in Newcastle the previous evening.

The victim ran away from the property and fled to a nearby petrol station before reporting to police.

Both were charged the following day and remanded in custody until their trial.

Detective Constable Simon Beardmore, from CID North, said: "I want to commend the victim for coming forward and giving evidence and going through the process. These men took advantage of a vulnerable young woman whose intention was to have a night out with friends.

"I would like to personally thank the witnesses who assisted with this case and those who provided CCTV at such an early stage. We had full co-operation from the locations involved and without them we would not have been able to present such compelling evidence for the case.
