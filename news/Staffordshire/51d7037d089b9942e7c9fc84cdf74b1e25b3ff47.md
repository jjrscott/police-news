Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward as part of an investigation into a car colliding with different vehicles in Tamworth this morning.

And as part of the investigation images of suspected stolen items have been released with the hope of reuniting them with their owners.

The force received reports of a vehicle being driven erratically at around 6.35am. The vehicle - a blue Renault Megane - reportedly hit a van and a car before being found on its roof on Mariner at around 7.15am.

It is believed the Megane had previously travelled on roads including Fontenaye Road, Coton Lane, before being discovered on Lichfield Road Industrial Estate.

A 17-year-old man was later arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, driving while unfit through drugs, failing to stop following a collision, and burglary of a dwelling. He is currently in police custody.

As part of the investigation officers have recovered a number of items they believe to have been stolen. Anyone who recognises the items in the photographs is asked to come forward.

Anyone who may have witnessed the vehicle being driven in Tamworth this morning - or who may have CCTV or dashcam footage - should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 0070 of January 19, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
