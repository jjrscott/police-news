Officers are appealing for any information about a public disorder incident they attended in Napier Street, Burton, in the early hours of this morning (26 January) that saw one man arrested.

We received a call at about 1.30am to reports of up to 10 people in the street making noise and smashing windows.

Officers arrived by 1.40am and some of those concerned had gone into a property on the street. Initial attempts to gain a response from the property were ignored.

At 4.15am officers gained entry via a side door and one male - aged in his 20s, from Stoke-on-Trent - was arrested on suspicion of affray.

Another male present at the property was issued with a fixed penalty notice for breaching government Covid-19 regulations.

Sergeant Justin Rai of the Burton Neighbourhood Policing Team said: "Did you see or hear anything suspicious in the area around the time of the incident?

"If you have any information you should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 17 of 26 January, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
