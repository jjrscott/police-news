Detectives are appealing for information over a robbery using a knife at the TUI Travel Agents store on Bore Street, Lichfield at around 4pm yesterday (Tuesday 15 December).

A black male, described as tall, skinny, wearing a mask and gloves and carrying a grey Prada bag and a kitchen knife, entered the store.

Staff were made to open the safe inside the store. The male escaped on foot by running up Tamworth Street and onto Lombard Street in the direction of Stowe Street at about 4.15pm.

Thankfully no staff were harmed.
