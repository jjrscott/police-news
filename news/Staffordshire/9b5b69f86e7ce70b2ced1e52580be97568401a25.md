A Stafford man who was found with heroin with a street value of Â£4,000 has been jailed.

Andrew Gardener, 50, of Stone Road, Stafford, was jailed for 52 months at Stafford Crown Court on Monday (24 February) after pleading guilty possession with intent to supply a controlled drug of Class A - heroin.

Officers executed a warrant at Gardener's address on 26 September 2019 where a solid substance, now confirmed to be heroin, was found and seized.

A number of mobile phones were also discovered.

Gardener was sentenced to 44 months and a further eight months for breaching his suspended sentence, to be served consecutively.

Detective Constable Howard Davies, from force CID, said: "Even though Gardener was on a suspended sentence, this didn't stop him dealing. However, he was caught after we searched his home and was brought to justice.

"Those involved in drug crime won't be tolerated and we'll continue to put offenders before the courts."
