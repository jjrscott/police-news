A man who threatened to cough over two police officers claiming to have symptoms of Coronavirus has been jailed.

Mark Anthony Jones, 42, of Brace Street, Walsall, was sentenced to 12 months after pleading guilty to two counts of assault by beating of an emergency worker.

He was sentenced at North Staffordshire Justice Centre in Newcastle-under-Lyme today (Tuesday 21 April).

Jones was arrested on Sunday (19 April) after officers were called to reports of a domestic incident in Cannock.

A second man, a 33-year-old from Burton, has been charged with common assault on an emergency worker following his arrest yesterday morning (Monday 20 April).

He appeared before magistrates in Newcastle-under-Lyme this morning (Tuesday 21 April) and was remanded in custody. He is due to appear at Stafford Crown Court on 22 May.
