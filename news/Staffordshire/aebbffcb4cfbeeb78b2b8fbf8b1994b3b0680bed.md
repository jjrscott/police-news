Police are issuing a reminder that a Public Space Protection Order is in place in Tamworth, following an unauthorised 'car meet' in the town.

At around 10.30pm last night (24 June) Staffordshire Police received a number of calls from concerned residents reporting around 50 vehicles gathering in Glascote Road, Marlborough Way and surrounding areas. Some were seen racing, drifting and causing obstruction, excessive noise and nuisance.

The use of a PSPO gives police and designated council officers the power to act quickly to stop anti-social gatherings of car cruisers and racers who are causing, or likely to cause, nuisance, alarm or distress to local residents and businesses.

Officers can issue immediate penalties and even seize the nuisance vehicles. Offenders could receive a Fixed Penalty Notice of up to £100 or face prosecution resulting in a fine of up to £1,000.

Chief Inspector Paul Talbot said, "These type of events undoubtedly cause a significant risk of harm to members of the public and also those participating.

"We will not tolerate this type of nuisance and dangerous behaviour and we are determined to take action against offenders to keep our roads and community safe."

Anyone with any concerns or information can contact Staffordshire Police on 101, or report online via our website or social media pages.
