Stoke South Neighbourhood Policing Team (NPT) has a new Commander.

Temporary Chief Inspector Rob Hessell has taken on the role recently vacated by Karen Stevenson - who's now moved to the force's Operational Support Directorate at HQ.

Rob arrives in Stoke South having joined Staffordshire Police in 2002.

During his time with the force, he has performed a number of roles primarily in Investigations including CID, Serious & Organised Crime Unit and Special Branch.

Temporary Chief Inspector Hessell said: "I feel incredibly proud to make this move and serve the people of Stoke South having been born and bred in this area."

"I'm incredibly excited to work closely with other partners and lead an excellent team of officers and staff to make the area a safer place."

"We will be engaging with and working within our communities to ensure your concerns are listened to, tackling any local issues in the process".
