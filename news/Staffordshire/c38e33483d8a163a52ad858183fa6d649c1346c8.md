Officers from Staffordshire Police are appealing for information after a man was seriously assaulted in the Hartshill area of Stoke-on-Trent.

A man in his 40s has suffered serious head injuries and remains in hospital in a stable condition after a fight broke out at the Noah's Ark pub on Hartshill Road.

The fight, which started in the venue and then spilled out onto the street, occurred at around 11:15pm last night (28 August).

Detectives are interested to hear from anyone who was in Noah's Ark or passing the location at that time who may have witnessed the incident.

Officers remain at the scene for further investigation and increased neighbourhood patrols are in the area to offer reassurance to the local community.

Any witnesses or anyone with any information is asked to contact 101 or report online, quoting incident number 731 of 28 August. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
