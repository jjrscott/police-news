Detectives investigating a violent distraction burglary in the Park Hall area of Stoke-on-Trent at the end of last month have now arrested two men

The incident - which took place shortly before 7pm on Thursday 27 February - saw an 88-year-old woman pushed to the ground by a male offender having answered the door at her home address in Harington Drive.

She was then threatened with a screwdriver before the offender stole thousands of pounds in cash.

Yesterday (Friday 13 March), police arrested a 27-year-old man from Leicestershire on suspicion of robbery and other offences. He remains in custody while enquiries continue.

A 52-year-old man from Stoke was detained earlier this month on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent and aggravated burglary. He has been released on police bail.

The victim remains in a stable condition but is said to be very poorly in hospital.

The investigation's ongoing and police are asking for any witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 654 of 27 February, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
