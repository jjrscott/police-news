Heroin and crack cocaine has been seized by officers following an arrest in Kidsgrove last night (Jan 9).

Officers from Staffordshire Police's newly-formed Disruption Team stopped a car in Fifth Avenue just after 5pm, but the car sped off, before colliding with garden walls and fences.

A 40-year-old man from Kidsgrove was arrested for possession with intent to supply heroin and crack cocaine and driving offences.

DS Richard Hudson, of the Disruption Team North, said "Colleagues from the Disruption Team and Tactical Support Team have worked together to ensure a large quantity of class A drugs, believed to be worth in excess of Â£4,000, will not reach the streets."

The Disruption Team is working closely with colleagues from Merseyside Police to target cross-border crime.

Anybody with any information regarding to drug activity in their area should call 101 or alternatively crime stoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
