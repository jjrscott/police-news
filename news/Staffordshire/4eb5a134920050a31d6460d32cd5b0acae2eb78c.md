Two more people have been arrested following a burglary at a Scouts hut in Cannock last month.

A 36-year-old woman and a 21-year-old man, both from Cannock, were arrested as part of Operation Disrupt on Friday (August 23) in connection with an incident which took place on June 28 on Old Fallow Road.

A number of items were stolen including four air riffles, army bags, clothing, sweets and a sum of charity money.

A 43-year-old man and a 16-year-old boy were arrested in connection with the incident on July 29.

Officers located the air rifles but the other missing items have not been found.
