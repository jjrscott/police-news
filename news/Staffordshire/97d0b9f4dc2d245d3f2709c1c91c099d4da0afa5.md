Do you recognise this man? We are appealing for information as to his identity relating to an incident where bank cards taken from a lost wallet were used on a spending spree around Burton town centre.

A Burntwood resident lost their wallet somewhere between their home and place of work in Sutton Coldfield on 9 November. Upon returning home and attempting to cancel their cards, they found that money was missing from their accounts.

Enquiries with their bank found that at about midday on 9 November in the post office within the ASDA store at the Octagon Centre on Orchard Street in Burton on Trent somebody had used one of their cards to withdraw £2,400.90 in foreign currency.

The transaction was caught on CCTV which showed the white male pictured wearing a flat cap, face mask, glasses and a bright orange puffer-style jacket using the card.

Another card was used at the Barclays Bank ATM on High Street, Burton, where £500 was withdrawn at about 2pm.

And shortly after a third card was used in the Boots store in Coopers Square shopping centre and £360 was spent.

Further transactions were unsuccessfully attempted throughout the day.

Anyone who recognises the man pictured or who has any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 201 of 10 November, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
