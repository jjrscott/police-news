Two men have been arrested as part of a crackdown on vehicle crime in Wombourne and Kinver.

Officers were called to a report of tools being taken from a vehicle on Station Road in Wombourne at around 12.30pm yesterday (5 November).

Colleagues from West Midlands Police followed a vehicle suspected to be involved and arrested two men from Walsall, 28 and 19, on suspicion of theft following a vehicle stop in Dudley.

They were also arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and theft in connection with offences in Wolverhampton on Monday (4 November) and Dudley yesterday (5 November).

Chief Inspector Mark Ward, of South Staffordshire neighbourhood policing team, said: "These arrests are part of a zero-tolerance approach to vehicle crime in South Staffordshire.

"We're continuing to target hotspot areas alongside colleagues from our neighbouring forces and Central Motorway Police Group and would ask the public to come forward with any information that may assist.

"Anyone who witnesses any suspicious behaviour or has any information about vehicle crime can direct message us on Facebook and Twitter, call 101 or call Crimestoppers anomyously on 0800 555 111."
