Police are appealing for witnesses after an elderly woman was targeted in a distraction burglary in Newcastle-under-Lyme.

Officers were called to a property in the Dartmouth Avenue area shortly before 11am this morning to reports two men entered the property - with one claiming to be a police officer.

It's reported that whilst one distracted the victim, the other carried out an untidy search of the house - taking a large amount of cash in the process.

Officers are asking for anyone to come forward if they witnessed the incident, saw any suspicious men, vehicles or activity in the area at the time.

We are also appealing for anyone with relevant CCTV or dash-cam footage to get in touch.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 220 of 27 February, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
