A 33-year-old man from Tamworth's been handed a 15 month jail term - suspended for 12 months - after being found guilty of importing cannabis into the UK.

Gareth Wright of Marlow Road was convicted after he received a shipment of marked up footballs from Canada in November 2018. The package was found to contain heat sealed packets of cannabis - totalling around Â£5000.

Wright had initially claimed the order was a mistake and never ordered cannabis but an investigation into his finances found he had sent multiple international payments to the sender.

PC Marshall of Tamworth Neighbourhood Policing Team says, "Wright originally denied knowing anything about this illegal importation.

"He fabricated a story in interview and claimed not to know the sender but pleaded guilty after a strong case against him.

"Fantastic investigation work into his finances after a good spot from Border Force shows that anyone responsible for this type of behaviour will be brought to justice."
