We are appealing for information about a burglary that saw 16 spin bikes stolen from Brough Park Leisure Centre, in Leek.

The centre, on Brough Park, off Fowlchurch Road, was the victim of a raid between 11.30pm and midnight on Tuesday (17 November).

As well as the stolen spin bikes, which are described by staff at the leisure centre as being "very distinctive in colour", a fire exit was damaged leading to roughly Â£1,000 in repairs.

Witnesses report seeing a white box-type panel van with a tail lift at its rear creeping past the entrance to the leisure centre during this period before reversing into Nelson Street, pausing, and then returning to Brough Park.

The driver of the van, a male, was described by witnesses as wearing dark clothing.

CCTV from the leisure centre then picked up two males wearing surgical face masks, beanie-type hats and dark clothing. Both were also wearing gloves.

The van was then caught on CCTV reversing along the back of the leisure centre before later driving off.

Sgt Alex Gould, of the Moorlands neighbourhood policing team, said: "Did you see or hear anything suspicious in the area around the time of the incident?

"This leisure centre is used by the community for both physical and mental exercise and wellbeing and this incident will affect those that use the site."
