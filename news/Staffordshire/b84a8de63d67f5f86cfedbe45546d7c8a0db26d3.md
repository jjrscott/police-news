Dozens of cannabis plants have been discovered at a house in Stoke-on-Trent after officers responded to concerns around activity at the property.

Stoke-on-Trent North Neighbourhood Policing Team uncovered 41 full size plants at the address on Tunstall's St Aidan's Street after gaining entry on Tuesday.

Along with the plants, officers found the electricity had been bypassed and subsequently contacted Western Power to make the property safe.

Sergeant Charlie Emmett, deputy commander of Stoke-on-Trent North Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "This came about following concerns being raised over activity at the address. I would urge anyone who has concerns over drug misuse in their area to contact us and allow our officers to deal with it.

"Cannabis grows represent a real fire risk due to how the electricity is usually bypassed and subsequently the wiring is not safe. It is important anyone with information about such set-ups report them to us."

No arrests have yet been made and enquiries are ongoing. Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 0403 of March 23, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
