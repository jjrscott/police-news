Police are appealing for witnesses after two elderly men were targeted in a distraction burglary in the Derrington area of Stafford.

At approximately 5.30pm last night (Wednesday 18 November) a group of four men wearing masks entered a property in the village, claiming to be police detectives.

They carried out an untidy search and encouraged the residents to hand over Â£1,500 in cash.

Officers are asking for anyone to come forward if they witnessed the incident, saw any suspicious men, vehicles or activity in the area at the time.

We are also appealing for anyone with relevant CCTV or dash-cam footage to get in touch.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 526 of 18 November, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
