Rosemary's family have paid tribute to her: "In her work as a teacher and as a trusted educational advisor, Rosemary was fiercely capable, compassionate and kind.

"These qualities were shown in the love she gave as wife, sister, mother, grandmother and dear friend."

"This is an overwhelming loss and we will miss her so much."
