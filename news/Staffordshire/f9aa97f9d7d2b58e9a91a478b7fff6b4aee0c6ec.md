A 27-year-old man has been charged over two burglaries at a business in Stone.

Jack Insley, of Newcastle Street, Stone, is due to appear before magistrates at North Staffordshire Justice Centre later (Tuesday 2 February).

He has been charged with two counts of non-residential burglary following break-ins at a business across two days last month in which mobile phones were stolen.

He has been remanded in police custody ahead of his court appearance.

Chief Inspector Giles Parsons, of Stafford Borough Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We are determined to fully investigate all incidents in Stone.

"We appreciate the support of the public in providing us information."
