A 35-year-old man has been arrested in Stoke-on-Trent in connection with an incident earlier this week.

Armed officers attended an address in Dawlish Drive, Bentilee and arrested a man from Stoke-on-Trent at 5:45pm this afternoon (28 September).

The arrest follows an incident where four people were injured after being struck by pellets in the Wammy, off Wilmot Drive at 6.30pm Tuesday evening.

He remains in custody while enquiries continue. Two women from Stoke-on-Trent, aged 17 and 40, were also arrested on suspicion of assisting a suspect.

Anyone with information or CCTV/dashcam footage is urged to call 101 reference 621 of 24 September or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
