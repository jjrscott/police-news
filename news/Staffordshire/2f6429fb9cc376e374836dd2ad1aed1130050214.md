Officers discovered more than 140 cannabis plants at a Stoke-on-Trent house.

Staffordshire Police received reports of a cannabis factory operating at a house on Hawthorn Street in Cobridge.

And officers who shut down the operation found around 149 plants growing in a number of rooms including the loft space.

The force attended the property at 3.45pm on December 16 where the extent of the venture was uncovered.

Responding officers remained at the scene until the following day to allow for Western Power to attend the address and for all plants to be removed. Officers also discovered one room recording a temperature of more than 50 degrees Celsius.

Sergeant Phillip Ferns, deputy commander of Stoke-on-Trent North Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "I am pleased to see this operation closed down and the drugs inside stopped from going onto our streets.

"When these sort of factories are set up they often represent a danger to those living close to them and therefore stopping this venture from continuing is welcome news for our community.

"Anyone who has concerns over drug misuse should always contact the police and allow us to take action."

Inquiries over the set-up are now ongoing. Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 0410 of December 16, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
