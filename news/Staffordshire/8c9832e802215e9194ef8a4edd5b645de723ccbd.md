A 37-year-old man has been sentenced to six years behind bars after pleading guilty to a series of child sex offences involving a 13-year-old girl.

Jamie Talbot, of Jervis Street, Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, was convicted at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court of inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity, engaging in sexual communication with a child, causing a child to look at an image of sexual activity and three counts of making indecent images of a child.

He also admitted possessing an extreme pornographic image involving an animal.

The court heard how Talbot, a delivery driver, posed as a teenage boy online for two years in order to establish and maintain a relationship with the victim and her friends.

In addition to his jail term, at sentencing on Wednesday, Talbot was ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register for life and will be subject to a Sexual Harm Prevention Order for life.

DC Paul Edwards, of Staffordshire Police's child protection and exploitation team (CPET), said: "This is a harrowing and disturbing case where Talbot engaged with vulnerable children over a lengthy period of time in order to gain their trust for his own sick sexual gratification.

"I hope the sentence today brings some comfort to the victims and their families as they work to come to terms with what Talbot has put them through.

"As a force, we work tirelessly to catch offenders like Talbot to ensure they are stopped and brought to justice."
