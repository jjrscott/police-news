Officers have made a third arrest in connection with a reported hate crime incident at a takeaway in Burton.

A 28-year-old man from Swadlincote in Derbyshire was arrested on suspicion of affray after we received a number of reports of a gang of masked youths repeatedly throwing fireworks at a business on Uxbridge Street on the evening of Sunday, 8 November.

He has since been released on conditional police bail.

It follows the arrest of two teenagers from Burton last week in connection with the incident.

It comes after officers launched an appeal for witnesses to a public disorder incident where about 30 people were involved in a fight in Burton upon Trent last Thursday (12 November).

We received a call at about 9.30pm about a group of people fighting outside the children's centre on the junction of Byrkley Street and Waterloo Street.

Officers attended to disperse the groups, with some fleeing down Princess Street, and others in the direction of Burton train station.

An 18-year-old male, from Burton, was arrested during the incident for possession of an offensive weapon and affray.

A larger group was then spotted in Casey Lane on the same evening, but they were dispersed without major incident.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 660 of 8 November or 751 of 12 November, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
