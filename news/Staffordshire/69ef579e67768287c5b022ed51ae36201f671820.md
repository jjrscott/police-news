A 27-year-old man has been disqualified from driving for 20 months after admitting driving dangerously in Lichfield during the first lockdown.

Martin Jean Corcoveanu, from Walsall, appeared at Cannock Magistrates' Court on Friday (11 December) where he pleaded guilty to driving dangerously.

He was also given a 12-week sentence suspended for 12 months

The court heard that on Tuesday 5 May, two officers from the force's Road Crime Team were travelling along the A5 near Lichfield, which has a 70mph speed limit.

At approximately 11.20am, a BMW 3-Series was spotted driving at speeds over 70mph.

Following an investigation, Corcoveanu was found to have been driving at excessive speeds, at some points over 130mph, and to have travelled through a red light at a roundabout.

The defendant was charged on 13 November.

The officer in charge of the case, PC Craig Beardsley, of the force's Road Crime Team, said: "Corcoveanu clearly didn't care about the danger he was putting himself and others in with his dangerous driving, at speeds of over 130mph. His actions were reckless and it is a miracle that nobody was seriously hurt or injured."
