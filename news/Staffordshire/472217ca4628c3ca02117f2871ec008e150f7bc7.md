Two men have been charged after they climbed onto a roof of a takeaway premises in Newcastle yesterday afternoon (Tuesday 29 September).

Police were called at 2.20pm to reports of men on the roof. Officers attended and cordoned off the street as a precaution. Officers managed to persuade the men to come down from the roof at approximately 3.30pm.

Alan Wayne Edge, 23, of Andrew Place, Newcastle-under-Lyme and Ryan Scott Linyard, 26, of Holly Road, Crackley, Newcastle-under-Lyme, have been charged with using threatening or abusive words or behaviour or disorderly behaviour within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress. They are due to appear before magistrates at the North Staffordshire Justice Centre on 15 October.

A 17-year-old boy and an 18-year-old man have been released under investigating pending further enquiries.
