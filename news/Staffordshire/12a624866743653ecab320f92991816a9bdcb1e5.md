More than 100 motorists were caught ignoring the speed limit on a busy Staffordshire road.

Officers from Staffordshire Police's Road Policing Unit monitored the speed of motorists travelling along the A449 near Coven on Sunday.

And during the two-hour operation, where officers observed the stretch covered by a 40mph limit, 105 drivers were caught - with the highest speed recorded being 71mph.

PC Jim Hunt, of the force's road policing unit, said: "It was disappointing to see so many people ignoring the speed limit. Those who did can expect details through the post of how the offence will be dealt with.

"Speed remains a major factor in road traffic collisions and by holding operations such as this we want to raise awareness that limits are in place for a reason."
