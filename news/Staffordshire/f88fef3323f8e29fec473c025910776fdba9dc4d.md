Police investigating a jewellery burglary at a house in Sutton Coldfield are appealing for the public's help.

The incident happened between 3pm and 11.40pm at the property on 7 September on Hardwick Road while the residents were out. Unknown suspects are believed to have used a ladder to get into the house via a back bedroom window. They then made a search of the room and removed a safe containing high value gold jewellery. They're believed to have left the property the same way they came in.

Anyone with any information please get in touch via direct message on Facebook or Twitter or call 101, quoting incident number 891 of 7 September.
