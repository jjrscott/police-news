Updated News Post

Detectives searching for missing woman Janetta Tatler have renewed their appeal for help in finding her.

They are becoming increasingly concerned for the 65-year-old's well-being.

As part of the fresh appeal, a new photo of Janetta is being released.

She was last seen in Hanford, Stoke-on-Trent, at around 6.30pm yesterday evening (January 14).

After conducting further enquiries, officers have established that the woman captured on CCTV in Tesco Trent Vale is not Janetta.

We are appealing for anyone who believes they may have seen Janetta, or anyone matching her description, to get in touch as soon as possible.

She is described as 5ft 2ins tall, large build with short black hair. She was last seen wearing a beige fur coat and black leggings.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact Staffordshire Police quoting incident number 534 of 14 January.
