Staffordshire Police is urging residents to be responsible this Easter and stick to rule of six this Bank Holiday weekend.

Though the Stay at Home rule set out by government changed on Monday (29 March), you must continue to minimise the number of journeys you make and can only gather with either two households or six people outdoors.

You are still encouraged to stay local as much as possible.

Superintendent Tom Chisholm, Head of Neighbourhood Policing at Staffordshire Police, said: "There will be a continued police presence this weekend as people look to gather outdoors with friends and family in a group of up to six people.

"Officers will maintain their engage, explain and encourage approach but will not hesitate to carry out enforcement action if there is an obvious breaking of the rules.

"I would like to thank the people of Staffordshire for doing all they can to stick to the latest guidelines and wish everyone a happy and peaceful Easter."

Remember:

 * Only socialise indoors with people you live with or who are in your support bubble
 * Up to 6 people or 2 households can meet outside
 * Work from home if you can and only travel when necessary
 * If you have symptoms get a test and stay at home.

You can contact Staffordshire Police on Facebook, Twitter, call 101 or 999 in an emergency.
