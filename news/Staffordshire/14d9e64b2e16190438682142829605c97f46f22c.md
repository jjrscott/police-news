'No two days are the same in the police' says Superintendent Ricky Fields, who is encouraging others to join the force.

Ricky joined Staffordshire Police in 1990 at just 23 and has never looked back since. Having come from a military family he was encouraged by his father to join the police after he graduated from a teaching training college. He has worked his way through the ranks and now leads our Operations Department.

He said: "The greatest part of the job is being able to support people and knowing they are pleased with the service you have provided.

"I would tell anyone who is thinking of joining the police that it is an excellent career to get into with so many prospects and opportunities to develop. That's another thing I love about this job; seeing people achieve their potential and do well.

"The job has its challenges. It is not always easy trying to please everyone and spin so many plates at once but it is all worth it."

Staffordshire Police is now recruiting. The campaign, 'A job like no other', encourages people to apply for a new police officer programme which will run through 2020. New recruits will complete on the job training, whilst also studying for a professional qualification in a partnership with Staffordshire University.
