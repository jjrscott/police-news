Two men have been charged and searches carried out as a policing operation continued through the weekend in Stone.

David Bowers, 38, who lives in Stone town centre, is charged with attempted theft from garages in Northesk Street on 26 September. He has been given bail conditions.

Nicholas Cooper, aged 26, of Hawksmoor Road, Stafford, has been charged with driving with alcohol above the prescribed limit after being stopped by officers in Kent Grove, Stone, yesterday (Oct 11).

Officers have also been carrying out stop checks and searched a property off Mount Road.

Chief Inspector Giles Parsons, area commander for Stafford Neighbourhood policing Team, said: "We've been busy again through the weekend, building on the 11 arrests made last week.

"We're grateful for the support and information we've had from the public. Please continue to let us know about any suspicious behaviour, but let us deal with incidents."
