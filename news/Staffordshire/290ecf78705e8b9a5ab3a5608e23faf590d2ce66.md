Two arrests have been made following a stabbing in Norton in Stoke-on-Trent.

Emergency services were called to Mallorie Road just after 11pm on Tuesday (10 September) after a 19-year-old man was found with stab wounds.

He was taken to the Royal Stoke University Hospital for further treatment and his condition is now described as stable.

Last night (11 September) a 13-year-old boy and a 33-year-old man, both from Stoke-on-Trent, were arrested in connection with the incident. They remain in police custody and enquiries are on-going.

Anyone who saw a disturbance in the area around this time, or has any information that could help with the investigation, including CCTV or dash-cam footage, is asked to call 101 and quote incident number 773 of 10 September. Alternatively, for guaranteed anonymity, call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
