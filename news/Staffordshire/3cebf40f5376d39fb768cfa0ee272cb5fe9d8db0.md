Eight stop and searches were conducted by officers around Burton yesterday (26 January) which resulted in cautions being handed out for drugs offences and a number of illegal substances - and a car - being seized.

Among them, a Burton man, aged in his 20s, was stopped on Rosliston Road at about 6.35pm and found to have cocaine, cannabis, Â£700 and two phones on him. He will be spoken to voluntarily by officers.

A silver Ford Mondeo was seen acting suspiciously and stopped on Evershed Way at about 10.15pm. The driver - a man aged in his 50s from Burton - was found with cannabis and issued a caution for possession of a Class B drug.

And around the same time a grey Volkswagen Golf was seen on Derby Road and a man, from Burton and in his 20s, was found to have cannabis on him. Another caution for possession was issued.

Also, at about 7.30pm on Evershed Way a maroon Toyota Avensis was spotted and seized for having no insurance.
