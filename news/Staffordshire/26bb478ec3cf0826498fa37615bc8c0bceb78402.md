Detectives are appealing for dashcam footage following an assault which has left a 23-year-old Stoke-on-Trent man in a critical condition in hospital.

The attack took place on Lansbury Grove in Meir at around 11.20pm on Friday 1 May.

The team is particularly interested in dashcam footage of people travelling down Brookwood Drive and Lansbury Grove in Meir between 10.30pm and 11.25pm on Friday 1 May.

A man, from Stoke-on-Trent, has been arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Detective Inspector Lucy Maskew, of CID North, said: "We have spoken to a number of witnesses, but we would appeal for those with dashcam footage from that night on the two specific streets to come forward as soon as possible.

"This is a very serious incident where a young man has been left with severe head injuries.

"If you were there, or believe you know who was involved, or have other information which may assist our enquiry - no matter how small, please share this with us so we can find those responsible."

If you have any information about this assault, which has left a man fighting for his life, please message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 717 of 1 May, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
