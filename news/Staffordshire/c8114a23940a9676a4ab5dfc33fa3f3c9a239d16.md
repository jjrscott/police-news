Detectives investigating a serious assault in Burton are appealing for information.

The incident happened at around 10pm on Friday (4 October) in Lichfield Street, Burton, near to Burton College.

The victim, a man in his 20s, was making his way into town with four male friends when he was approached in the street and assaulted. He was knocked to the ground and sustained serious head injuries which required him to spend several days in hospital.

Witnesses or anyone with any information are asked to call 101 or private message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 834 of 4 October. Alternatively, you can contact the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
