Detectives are investigating an armed robbery which took place at a shop in Meir last month.

A man entered Todays Local Convenience Store on Sandon Road at 10pm on Monday 26 August holding what is believed to have been an hatchet-style axe.

He threatened a member of staff and stole a number of low-value items before fleeing in the direction of Rough Close.

The suspect, who was wearing a balaclava, is a described 5ft 10ins tall and of medium build. He was wearing blue trainers, light grey trousers, a dark coloured coat with a navy blue hoodie underneath and black gloves.

Enquiries are ongoing and detectives are appealing for any witnesses to get in touch. Anyone with information is urged call 101 quoting incident number 901 of 26 August or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
