A 17-year-old boy, from Stoke-on-Trent, has been charged with drug supply offences.

The boy, who can't be named for legal reasons, was charged with possession with intent to supply Class A drugs (crack cocaine), two counts of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs (heroin) and two counts of conspire to acquire/use/possess criminal property.

His arrest came on Friday (19 March) after officers recovered thousands of pounds worth of drugs from a property in Longton.

He appeared at the North Staffordshire Justice Centre on Saturday morning and has been remanded in custody.

A 31-year-old woman, also from Stoke-on-Trent, was also arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs. She has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.
