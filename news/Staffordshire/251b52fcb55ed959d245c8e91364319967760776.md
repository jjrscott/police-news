A woman who was subjected to a violent distraction burglary in Stoke-on-Trent sadly passed away today (March 17) in hospital.

Josephine Kaye, aged 88, was assaulted when she answered the door at her home in Harington Drive, Park Hall, on 27 February.

She was threatened with a screwdriver before the offender/s stole thousands of pounds in cash.

DCI Dan Ison, of Staffordshire Police, said he was now treating Mrs Kaye's death as a murder enquiry.

"Our thoughts are very much with Mrs Kaye's family. What was initially a burglary has now sadly become an investigation into her death."

"We have made three arrests, but our enquiries continue and we very much welcome any assistance the public can give us."

A 27-year-old man from Leicestershire, initially arrested on suspicion of robbery and other offences, remains in custody while enquiries continue.

He has been remanded in custody in connection with offences in Essex.

This afternoon officers arrested a 52-year-old man and a woman in her 60s, both from Stoke, on suspicion of murder. They are in custody at this time.

DCI Ison is asking for any witnesses or anyone with information to come forward. Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 654 of 27 February, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
