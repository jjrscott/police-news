A man that was left in critical condition following a serious assault has sadly died in hospital.

Stan Bacioiu, 44, who lived Burton-on-Trent but was originally from Romania, died on 1 December following an incident on Uxbridge Street on Friday 22 November where a report of men fighting inside an address was received at around 9.30pm.

Colleagues from West Midlands Ambulance Service attended the scene and Stan was taken to Nottingham Queen's Hospital in critical condition.

Detective Inspector Neil Poultney, from force CID, said: "An investigation into this serious assault is on-going and I would ask the public to come forward with any information that may assist.

"We're particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have seen any vehicles arriving or leaving the scene around the time of the incident. Specialist officers are supporting the man's family who have asked for privacy at this difficult time.

"Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting incident number 841 of 22 November, direct message us on Facebook or Twitter or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."

Two 22-year-old men, both from Burton-on-Trent, were arrested on suspicion of assault grievous bodily harm with intent last week in connection with the original incident and bailed pending further enquiries.
