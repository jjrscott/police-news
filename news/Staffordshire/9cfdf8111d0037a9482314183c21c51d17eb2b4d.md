Police are appealing for information after more than Â£170,000 worth of metal rods were stolen from a business in Burton.

It's believed the premises at Barton Business Park in Barton-under-Needwood was targeted by six individuals wearing balaclavas between 8:15pm and 10:15pm on Sunday 19 January.

It was only reported to Staffordshire Police after employees found the perimeter fence had been breached and then tied back together with cable ties.

The rods - which are 15kg in weight and 4m long - are then believed to have been taken away in a white panel van and saloon car.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 139 of 29 January, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
