A man from Tamworth has been jailed for three years and two months for sexual offences against a child in Staffordshire.

John Douglas Cunnington, 34, of Talland Avenue, Tamworth, was sentenced at Stafford Crown Court today (Tuesday 3 March) after being found guilty of causing/inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and sexual assault on a child at the same court yesterday (2 March).

He will also be required to sign the Sex Offenders Register for life.

Cunnington was arrested in February 2017, the morning after the offences took place.

Detective Constable Jackie Wood, of CID South, said: "Cunnington took advantage of a vulnerable boy for his own sexual gratification.

"The victim bravely supported our investigation throughout. I am glad that justice has now been done for the victim and his family."

Anyone who has suffered sexual abuse, or suspects others may be subject to sexual abuse, is urged to contact Staffordshire Police on 101.
