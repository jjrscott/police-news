A Burton man has been jailed for eight years after admitting three counts of rape.

Braden Rae, aged 44, was jailed at Wolverhampton Crown Court on June 11 after admitting three counts of rape in Burton-on-Trent.

The court heard that Rae, a former gym instructor in Burton who is now living in Derby, raped his victim twice in 2014, and also in 2015.

The woman later confided in a friend before making a report to police officers.

Rae, now of Lace Maker's Close, Borrowash, Derby, pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing.

Detective Constable Amy Gathergood, of Staffordshire Police, said: "The bravery of the witness in coming forward to the police has led to Braden Rae's jail term."

"We will always do whatever it takes to bring offenders to justice, while ensuring victims and their families are offered the support they need."

Anyone who has suffered sexual abuse, or suspects others may be subject to sexual abuse, is urged to call Staffordshire Police as soon as possible on 101.

Alternatively, for guaranteed anonymity, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
