The family of a woman found dead in woodland near to Roman Way, Tamworth last week, have paid tribute to her.

This follows the formal identification of 20-year-old Keeley Bunker from Tamworth.

Keeley's family have said: "We, the family of Keeley Bunker, are devastated at her death and we request that we are given time to allow us to grieve privately."

Keeley's family have set up a GoFundMe page. However, the force is aware that fake GoFundMe pages have been set up. The correct link is: https://www.gofundme.com/f/official-keeley-bunker-funeral-fund

A post mortem has taken place but further tests are required.

A 19-year-old man has been charged with murder following her death.
