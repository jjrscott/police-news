A man and a woman who died in Burton last week have been formally identified.

An investigation was launched after two bodies were discovered in a house on Henhurst Hill at around 10.45pm on Wednesday (4 September).

Following formal identification, detectives can confirm the identities of the pair are 31-year-old Kirils Nemcevs and 33-year-old Lana Nemceva, both from Burton-on-Trent and known to each other.

Post-mortems have now taken place and further tests are required.

A two-year-old boy was found unharmed at the property and is being cared for by relatives.

Detective Chief Inspector Dan Ison, senior investigating officer, said: "We are treating the 33-year-old woman's death as murder and the 31-year-old's death as non-suspicious. No one is being sought after in connection with the incident.

"The results of the post-mortem are inconclusive and further tests are now required to establish causes of death for both. A report is being prepared for the coroner and will be submitted at the conclusion of the police investigation.

"I would like to take this opportunity to urge members of the public and community not to speculate on the circumstances and respect the families' wishes of privacy to enable them to grieve at this sad time."
