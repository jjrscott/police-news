Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a teenage girl was assaulted in Meir.

The girl was walking with a friend in a park in the area of Mollison Road shortly before 8pm on Saturday 31 October when they were approached by someone she didn't know.

The boy - who claimed he was 16 - spoke to both girls before assaulting one of them. He then followed them over to the nearby skate park before moving across the bridge over the A50. He eventually walked away in the direction of the BP Services.

He's described as tall, skinny, with brown hair and wearing a blue tracksuit. He's also believe to have spoken with a local accent.

Detective Inspector Lucy Maskew from the force Child Protection and Exploitation team said: "This was a distressing incident for the victim and we're intent on finding the person responsible.

"We know there were a number of people in the area at the time and we're particularly interested in speaking with a group of males who were walking in the park between 19:45 and 20:15 on Halloween as we believe they may have seen the incident."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 854 of 31 October, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
