Police have warned off-road bikers they face having their vehicles seized - if they persist in using them around a residential area in Cannock.

Neighbourhood officers in Norton Canes say they have received a number of reports over such bikes causing issues around the Railway Street and School Crescent areas.

Officers have the power to place a Section 59 notice on a vehicle being used in an anti-social way, which would result in it being seized by the force.

PCSO Connor Ashton, of the Cannock Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We will always look to give advice and a warning before seizing such vehicles.

"But the nuisance caused by some of these off-road bikes has been a long-standing issue in Norton Canes. The community has suffered from noise, intimidation and anti-social riding.

"The use of off-road bikes is only permitted on private land with the permission of the land owner. If they are used away from those areas - and in an anti-social manner - we have the power to seize them."

Anyone with concerns over anti-social behaviour should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
