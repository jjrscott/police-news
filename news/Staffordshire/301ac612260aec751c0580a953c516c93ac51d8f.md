A senior police officer has asked car enthusiasts not to gather at planned events in Staffordshire this weekend.

Superintendent Tom Chisholm, Head of Neighbourhood Policing at Staffordshire Police, said he was aware of planned events in Stafford and Stoke-on-Trent this weekend.

 "We will be deploying more officers to these areas and will deal with any offences robustly, those taking part could face fines or even having their cars seized. These gatherings are disruptive to local residents and in breach of signposted restrictions."

Supt Chisholm said, while he understood lockdown was being eased, these gatherings still should not take place.

"Coronavirus continues to be a major risk, so we would urge people not to attend the events as there can be large numbers involved. We are asking drivers considering attending for the purposes of social gathering to consider the nuisance effects on local residents and stay away."

"I'm also calling on the public to help us - if you have any intelligence or hear about an event taking place, please get in touch with us so we can prevent it."

If you suspect a gathering is being set up or there is suspicious activity, contact Staffordshire Police via Facebook or Twitter, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
