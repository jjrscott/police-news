We're appealing for witnesses after a van was set on fire whilst it sat on the driveway of a house in Norton Canes.

The Ford Custom Transit van was targeted at approximately 2am on Friday 31 July in Norton Grange Crescent.

CCTV shows two people approaching the vehicle before pouring a liquid over it - setting it alight.

The pair then made off from the scene.

DC Ken Cox from force CID said: "We're determined to track those responsible down and we continue to carry out extensive enquiries in the local area.

"In addition, anyone who saw a white van acting suspiciously in the area at the time should get in touch, as we believe it could be linked to what happened."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 21200034275, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
