A 21-year-old man has been charged with being concerned in the supply of heroin and crack cocaine in Burton.

Two further arrests were made for suspected drugs offences as part of an ongoing police operation in the town.

Brandon Fisher, 21, of Meadow Road, Burton, is charged with being concerned in the supply of heroin and crack cocaine, possessing cannabis and possessing criminal property in Burton yesterday (June 30).

A 40-year-old woman from Burton was arrested in Meadow Road at 1130am yesterday (June 30) for possession of heroin and crack cocaine.

Just before 2pm officers stopped a car in Coopers Square shopping centre and arrested a 64-year-old local man on suspicion of possession with intent to supply cannabis.

A subsequent search at an address in Branston uncovered cannabis, ecstasy and a crossbow.
