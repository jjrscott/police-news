Two men have been arrested on suspicion of child sexual offences this morning as part of warrants by the force's Operation Safenet team.

Supported by Digital Forensics and the newly-formed Neighbourhood Tasking Team, they arrested the men in Stoke-on-Trent.

A 63-year-old, from Stoke-on-Trent, has been arrested on suspicion of possess to show/distribute an indecent photo/pseudo-photograph of a child, distribute an indecent photo/pseudo-photograph of a child and make an indecent photograph/pseudo-photograph of a child. He remains in police custody.

A 35-year-old, from Stoke-on-Trent, has been arrested on suspicion of causing/inciting a girl under 13 to engage in sexual activity. He has been released on bail pending further enquiries.

Operation Safenet aims to safeguard children by detecting abuse and prosecuting offenders for the
possession and distribution of indecent images of children.

Anyone who has suffered sexual abuse, or suspects others may be subject to sexual abuse, is urged to contact Staffordshire Police on 101.

Alternatively, the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
