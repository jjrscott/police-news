Police are appealing for witnesses - and dash cam footage - after a motorist fled from a vehicle after flipping the car and leaving it on its roof in a garden.

Officers had previously been pursuing the blue Ford Fiesta through Sneyd Green and Bucknall in Stoke-on-Trent at around 11.35am on Sunday, December 13. During the pursuit the car - which officers believe to have been stolen - deliberately rammed them.

And after losing sight of the vehicle it was later found on Greyfriars Road in Abbey Hulton where it was on its roof in a garden.

Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service were called to the property which the car had collided with where a commander deemed there was no need for a structural engineer.

The vehicle was later recovered and will undergo forensic checks. Meanwhile the force is continuing its investigations to trace the driver of the vehicle with officers also checking through CCTV. Officers are also keen to hear from anyone who may have dash cam footage capturing the car as it travelled through the Potteries.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 0227 of December 13, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
