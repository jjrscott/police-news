Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted at a petrol station in Trentham.

Police were called at 7.35pm on 28 December 2020 to reports that a group of males had assaulted a man at the BP petrol station on Longton Road. After the assault, the group ran off towards the Trentham Hotel.

It is believed that the victim had intervened after the group were throwing snowballs at an older man in a white car.

The man was taken to the Royal Stoke University Hospital. His jaw was broken in two places, which required surgery.

Detective Constable Lightfoot, of CID North, said: "I am keen to hear from witnesses including the man in the white car as we believe he may be able to help with our investigation."

A man, aged 20, and a 16-year-old boy, both from Stoke-on-Trent, have been arrested on suspicion of wounding with intent, and a 17-year-old boy, also from Stoke-on-Trent, has been arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent. They have all been released on conditional bail pending further enquiries.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 723 of 28 December, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
