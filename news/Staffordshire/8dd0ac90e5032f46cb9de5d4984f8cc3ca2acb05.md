Staffordshire Police will join local communities in a minute's silence at 12pm today as part of the Marie Curie National Day of Reflection as officers and staff pause and think about those who have lost their lives and those who have lost loved ones at this most difficult of times.

Chief Constable, Gareth Morgan, said: "The past year has clearly been an incredibly tough and challenging one for us all and especially for those who have lost loved ones.

"Overall, the public's response during these difficult times, and how they have coped with the restrictions placed on them as part of the national effort to save lives, has been extraordinary.

"I want to thank everyone for the many personal sacrifices they have made, and continue to do so, as this has been vitally important in the efforts to stop the spread of the virus.

"I also want to thank colleagues across Staffordshire Police for their commitment and contribution during this past year.

"I am grateful for their continuing professionalism and dedication as they work with partners and communities as we look ahead to the easing of restrictions and a welcome return to a more normal way of life."
