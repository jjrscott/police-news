Detectives are appealing for information after the death of a woman in Newcastle-under-Lyme.

It's after officers were called to a property on Cresswell Avenue, Newcastle shortly before 10am this morning (Saturday 2 January) by colleagues at the ambulance service to reports of a death of a woman in her 30s.

A 59-year-old man from Newcastle has since been arrested on suspicion of murder. He remains in police custody at this time.

An investigation and local enquiries are now underway.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 111 of 2 January, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 **.**
