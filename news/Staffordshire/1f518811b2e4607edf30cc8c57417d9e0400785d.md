Detectives investigating an armed robbery at a shop in Newcastle-under-Lyme are appealing for witnesses at the scene to come forward.

Officers were called at around 9.30pm on 10 March to a report of a male threatening staff with a knife at Co-op on Hanbridge Avenue in Bradwell before making off with cigarettes and alcohol.

The male was then seen to run down Hanbridge Avenue and onto Cauldon Avenue where he got into a vehicle parked opposite St Barnabas Church.

Detective Constable David Stubbs, from CID, said: "Enquiries into this armed robbery are underway and I'd like to hear from people nearby who may have information that may be able to assist with our investigation.

"Anyone who may have seen the male before or after leaving the shop, particularly a man on a bicycle outside the store at the time, should get in touch.

"We would also like to hear from three people who are believed to have been walking past the church at the time that the male got into the back of a vehicle."

Two 15-year-old boys have been arrested on suspicion of robbery and remain in custody at this time.

Anyone with information can call 101 quoting incident number 798 of 10 March, message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
