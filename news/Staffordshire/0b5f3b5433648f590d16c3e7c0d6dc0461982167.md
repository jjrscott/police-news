Three people have been arrested after officers stopped a vehicle reported to have been stolen 15 minutes before.

Officers received a call to a report of a stolen car from an address on Overwoods Road in Tamworth at 1.20am on 9 June.

An Audi A5 was taken from an address and with the help of colleagues from neighbouring forces, Warwickshire and West Midlands, officers located the vehicle on Old Park Road in Lozells, Birmingham, at around 1.34am.

An 17-year-old from Birmingham, a 17-year-old from Rotherham and an 21-year-old from Birmingham were all arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle. They have been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Richard Dancey, from CID, said: "The quick work of officers led to the stolen car being recovered and three people being arrested.

"Catching those responsible for stealing cars is one of our force priorities and we will continue to work to bring those responsible to justice."
