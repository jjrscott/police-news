Police are appealing for witnesses after a girl was shot in the face with a BB gun at Tittesworth Reservoir.

The 14-year-old required surgery to her cheek after a .22 pellet lodged itself in her face - just missing her eye - at approximately 16:00pm on Thursday 25 June.

CCTV enquiries have taken place but officers are keen to speak to anyone who was there that afternoon.

PC Byron Taylor from the Moorlands Neighbourhood Policing Team said: "This was a horrible experience for the girl who is still caring for her injury.

"The investigation into those responsible has been extensive but we're still keen to speak to anyone who was at Tittesworth Reservoir around the time of the incident."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 589 of 25 June, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
