Ninety-three arrests were made and cars and drugs seized during a busy period of action for officers across Staffordshire.

Operation Disrupt ran across the county from November 15 to 21, culminating in activity to arrest those suspected of online offences today (21 Nov).

Three men from Stoke-on-Trent were arrested - a 26-year-old man on suspicion of two counts of sexual communication with a child, an 18-year-old man on suspicion of possessing/making indecent images of children and a 27-year-old man on suspicion of making and distributing indecent images of children.

Officers arrested three men - aged 25, 27 and 29, and all from the Stoke-on-Trent area in Fenton on 17 November on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm.

Other arrests included three men and a woman detained for being wanted on warrant and a woman arrested on suspicion of theft.

A number of motorists were reported for driving offences and several cars were seized. Officers also seized quantities of heroin, crack cocaine and cannabis.

Activity took place across the county from south Staffordshire to Stoke-on-Trent.

Chief Inspector Phil Eaton, of Staffordshire Police, said: "This has been a busy week of coordinated activity to tackle those suspected of committing crime in Staffordshire.

"We've had success disrupting criminal activity, but of course our work goes on and we will continue to bring those suspected of crimes before the courts."
