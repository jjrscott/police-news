Three men and four teenage boys from Burton-on-Trent have appeared in court charged with serious sexual offences involving children.

The seven have been charged following an investigation carried out by officers from the force's Child Protection and Exploitation Team.

David Korosi, 25, was charged with two counts of sexual assault and rape of a girl aged 13 to 15.

Adrian Demeter, 19, has been charged with rape of a girl aged 13 to 15 and sexual assault.

Jeno Maka, 18, from Burton, was charged with causing/inciting a girl aged 13 to 15 to engage in sexual activity.

Four boys, two aged 15 and two aged 16, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were also charged with sexual offences against a child. One of the 16-year-olds was also charged with burglary and theft.

All appeared at South Derbyshire Magistrates' Court.

A 16-year-old boy, also from Burton, has been released from bail with no further action.
