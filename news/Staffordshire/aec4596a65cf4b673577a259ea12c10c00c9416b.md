Detectives are appealing for witnesses after they arrested three men and a woman as part of an investigation into an unexplained death in Stoke-on-Trent last night.

Police were called to a property on Lime Street at around 9:30pm following a report of a man in his 30s in need of emergency medical attention. Sadly despite the best efforts of paramedics, the man died a short while later.

The deceased's next of kin have been informed and specially trained officers are providing support at this difficult time. Formal identification of the body is yet to take place.

A woman aged 30 and three men aged 32, 35 and 42, all from Stoke-on-Trent, have been arrested on suspicion of murder as part of the investigation. All four remain in custody for questioning at this time.

A scene remains at the address whilst the investigative team work to establish the circumstances leading up to the man's death. Increased neighbourhood patrols are in the area to assist with evidence gathering and to provide reassurance to the local community.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 769 of 20 February, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
