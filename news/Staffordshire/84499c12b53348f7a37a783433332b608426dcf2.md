A 62-year-old man from Stoke-on-Trent has been jailed for drugs offences.

Barrington Fox of Clyde Street, Shelton was arrested in March 2019 after local officers executed a warrant under the Misuse of Drugs Act.

A large quantity of Class A drugs - with an estimated worth of £1070 - were recovered and seized - alongside more than £800 in cash.

Having yet to be charged, Fox was released under investigation - during which time he committed a further offence in December 2020.

Officers carried out a stop search on Clyde Street, Shelton and drugs, phones and related paraphernalia were seized.

Drugs seized across both offences had an estimated total worth of more than £2000.

Fox has now been sentenced to six years behind bars having pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply Class A drugs and possession of a Class A drug following an appearance at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court.

Sergeant Marc Proctor from the Stoke South Neighbourhood Policing Team said: "This is a great result and one that further emphasises our message that those dealing drugs on our streets will be punished.

"I hope this is a clear message that we will target those who think they can deal drugs and cause misery in our communities. We will continue to work hard, gather intelligence and bring offenders before the courts."
