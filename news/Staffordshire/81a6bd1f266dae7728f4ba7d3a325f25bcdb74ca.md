More than 90 motorists were caught speeding during operations on two of Staffordshire's busiest roads.

Staffordshire's Road Policing Unit carried out the checks on the A50 in Uttoxeter and the A38 in Claymills - where officers monitored the stretches covered by a 70mph limit.

But across the two locations a total of 93 vehicles were caught speeding - with one driver travelling at 104mph.

In addition, a number of cars were found to have defects or not MOT. Police also seized two vehicles - with one found to have no tax and the other not being insured.

Vehicles also underwent inspections by the unit's specially-trained officers who issued two notices where the recipients have a specified time period to carry out repairs.

Temporary Sergeant Dave Cruxton, who oversaw Tuesday's operation, said: "These operations are about showing the public that we are out policing the roads to ensure they are safe for drivers to use.

"It is unfortunate such a high number of people did not adhere to the speed limit and they will now be dealt with accordingly. While we have the camera van, we were pulling over vehicles to check their roadworthiness and to deal with those motorists travelling at extremely high and dangerous speeds.

"Speed remains one of the key factors in serious collisions in Staffordshire and operations such as this help to spread awareness and educate those who simply cannot adhere to the limit."
