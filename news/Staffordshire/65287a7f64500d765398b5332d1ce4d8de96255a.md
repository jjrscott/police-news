Officers have struck up a partnership with the Post Office to help provide support to the elderly who have been isolating during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Officers from South Staffs Neighbourhood Policing Team have been trialling the Adopt a Post Office scheme, which sees the two organisations working together to build relationships with the public, increase engagement and accessibility and reduce crime. Following the success of the trial, the initiative will be rolled out across the county.

As part of the initiative, which will see around 100 Post Offices involved, officers hold drop-in surgeries at various post office branches which are promoted via social media, Smart Alerts, posters and at local engagement events.

Sergeant Kelly Wareing, from South Staffordshire Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "Our PCSOs will set up socially distant or online surgeries in local Post Office branches across the county to help provide extra support to the vulnerable who have been struggling or self-isolating during the pandemic.

"We'll be providing advice and support and offer ways in which vulnerable members of the community, who are often potential victims of fraud, can protect themselves.

"We've previously worked with local Post Offices before and it's always been a huge success.

"This continued partnership will enable us to maximise our engagement with all members of the community across Staffordshire."

Local officers will be advertising their local surgeries over the coming weeks on social media and Smart Alert. To sign up to Smart Alert, visit https://www.staffordshiresmartalert.co.uk/.
