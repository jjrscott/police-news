A 24-year-old man from Burslem has been ordered to pay back more than £84,000 after being convicted over drug offences last year.

Kamran Khan, formerly of Davison Street, was one of four men and a woman convicted of being involved in the supply of heroin and cocaine across north Staffordshire and south Cheshire, in December 2019.

He was sentenced to two additional years behind bars on top of a seven-year sentence previously received for drug dealing.

Khan appeared via video link from HMP Featherstone at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on Wednesday for a proceeds of crime act hearing.

He was found to have benefitted from £84,462.86 as a result of his part in the conspiracy to supply drugs and ordered to pay the full amount within three months or face a further seven-month prison term.

Speaking following the hearing, DS Chris Roberts of the Financial Investigations Unit, said: "This is a significant outcome for the unit who have worked alongside colleagues in the Major and Organised Crime Unit to bring Khan to justice and prevent individuals profiting from the supply of illegal drugs across Staffordshire."

If you suspect someone is involved in the supply of illegal drugs, please contact Staffordshire Police on 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800111 555.
