A man has been arrested following a warrant in Newcastle this morning.

Officers, including armed officers, carried out the warrant at 6am at a property on Camillus Road, Newcastle-under-Lyme. The area was cordoned off while a search of the premises was carried out.

The warrant was part of Operation Disrupt, which tackles the high threat and harm issues affecting people living in the county.

A 38-year-old man, of no fixed address, was arrested on suspicion of possessing a firearm. He is now in custody awaiting questioning.
