Detectives are appealing for information after a reported car-jacking in Tamworth.

Officers were called to the Ventura Retail Park, by Marks and Spencer, shortly before 8pm on Thursday 19 November following reports a blue Audi S3 had been stolen by masked men.

The victim had been putting away his trolley after shopping when a car - described as similar to a dark coloured Volkswagen Tiguan - pulled up alongside him. He was then pushed to the ground by three masked men - who demanded his keys.

The group then drove off in both cars.

The stolen vehicle has since been recovered in Birmingham but an investigation, to identify those responsible, is now underway.

DS Richard Dancey of CID South said: "This was a brazen attack on someone who had just been going about their daily business.

"We're happy that the vehicle has been recovered but we are continuing to carry out an investigation to find those responsible."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 606 of 19 November call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
