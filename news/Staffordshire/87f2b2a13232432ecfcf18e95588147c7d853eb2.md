Eight dogs reported as stolen from a property in Burton-upon-Trent have been reunited with their owner.

Police were called at 10.15pm last night (25 May) to a report of a break-in at an address in the Derby Road area. Four American Bulldogs and four French Bulldogs had been taken from their kennels.

Within 45 minutes officers had found and recovered the dogs after colleagues from Derbyshire Police stopped a vehicle travelling on the M1 northbound just before 11pm.

A 22-year-old man of no fixed address was arrested on suspicion of burglary. A further three men from South Yorkshire - aged 31, 32 and 40 - and a 29-year-old woman, were all arrested on suspicion of theft.

They remain in custody at this time.
