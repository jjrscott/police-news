Staffordshire Police is inviting residents and businesses across the county to take part in a new survey designed to help the force achieve its vision of a safer Staffordshire.

The 'Your police. Your voice.' survey, which launches on Friday 22 January and closes on 8 February, provides the public with an opportunity to share their views on crime and policing locally. This will enable the force to get a better understanding of the issues which matter most to local communities to ensure that services and resources are being delivered in the best way to address people's concerns.

Assistant Chief Constable Scott Green, said: "Everything we do at Staffordshire Police is centred on our ambition to improve the safety and wellbeing of people, places and communities across Staffordshire.

"One of our five policing priorities is ensuring the public has confidence in Staffordshire Police to be there when they need us, to treat them with respect and to help them to feel safe in their communities. This survey will give people an opportunity to share their views on how well we are doing this."

The survey will run quarterly and invites feedback on local crime concerns, police contact and the force's response on a number of important areas, including policing during the Coronavirus pandemic.

ACC Scott Green continued: "I would urge people to get involved in shaping how policing is delivered locally by taking part in the 'Your police. Your voice.' survey. We want to understand the issues that matter most to communities so we can develop robust plans and dedicate resources to tackling these.

Ultimately, this will help us to continually improve the service we deliver to the communities we serve.

The survey is anonymous and consists of 32 questions, taking under 10 minutes to complete.

The survey will be administered online using Survey Monkey. However it is available in paper copy via www.staffordshire.police.uk

The survey will run from 22 January 2021 to 8 February 2021. To complete the survey visit www.staffordshire.police.uk/yourpoliceyourvoice
