A man was left with serious head injuries following an assault in Burslem Park in the early hours of this morning.

Detectives are appealing for information after they were called to a report of a serious assault of a man in his 20s near the bandstand in Burslem Park at around 12:20am this morning (1 November).

The victim remains in hospital in a stable condition.

Forensic investigators are at the scene and to help preserve evidence officers have closed off the park for the time being. Increased neighbourhood patrols are in the area to identify any witnesses and to offer reassurance to any concerned residents.

Anyone with information or who may have witnessed suspicious behaviour at that time is urged to contact us on social media or 101 quoting incident number 13 of 1 November. Alternatively, for guaranteed anonymity, contact Crimestoppers.
