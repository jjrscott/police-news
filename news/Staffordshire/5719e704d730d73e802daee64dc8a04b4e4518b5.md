We are urging local businesses to be vigilant in terms of site security following a recent spate of burglaries in Newcastle-under-Lyme.

This week a number of burglaries have taken place overnight with storage containers being targeted at businesses / building sites in Baldwins Gate, Loggerheads and Balterley. Thousands of pounds worth of tools and equipment have been stolen after offender(s) forced entry.

Enquiries are on-going, and officers are asking local residents and business owners to be vigilant and report any suspicious behaviour, persons or vehicles to the police.

Please ensure that your properties are secure at all times, and that items of value are removed off-site especially if being left for long periods of time. Please consider other preventative measures, such as implementing CCTV, using security lighting/alarms and marking tools - so if they are stolen and recovered - they can be easily traced back to you.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact us on 101. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
