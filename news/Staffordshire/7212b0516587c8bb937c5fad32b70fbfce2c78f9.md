Lichfield's Neighbourhood Policing Team (NPT) has a new commander.

Chief Inspector Mark Ward has taken on the role recently vacated by Mark Smith - who's now moved to the force's Operations Department.

Mark arrives in Lichfield having transferred to Staffordshire Police in 2017 - having spent 20 years at West Midlands Police.

During his time at our neighbouring force, Mark took up mainly uniformed positions in Wolverhampton and Birmingham - in particular within neighbourhood policing.

On his arrival in Staffordshire three years ago, Mark took up the position of Deputy Commander in Cannock before moving on to the South Staffordshire NPT as Commander.

He then took nine months out of local policing - taking on a role as Head of Learning and Development at force headquarters, before accepting the position as head of local policing in Lichfield.

Chief Inspector Mark Ward said: "I feel incredibly proud to make this move and serve the one, true city of Staffordshire.

"I am new to Lichfield but I'm incredibly excited in getting to know the area and communities, working closely with an excellent and talented team of officers and staffs.

"We will be engaging and working with partners to ensure your concerns are listened to, tackling any local issues in the process.

In his spare time, Mark is a keen sportsman and regularly plays badminton. He's also a big football fan but says his playing days are behind him!
