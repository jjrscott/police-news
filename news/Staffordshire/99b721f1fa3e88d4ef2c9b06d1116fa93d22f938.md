Detectives are investigating a robbery at an EE shop in Leek after around Â£5,000 worth of phones were taken.

Police were called to the store on Derby Street at 5pm yesterday (Monday) after four men entered and threatened the staff. The employees hid in the back room after seeing one of the men go to remove something from his pocket.

Seven phones were taken from the displays and the shelves themselves were damaged.

All four of the men appeared to be in their 20s and wore dark clothing, two of them in dark Parka-style coats.

They are believed to have made off in the direction of London Bank.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 586 of December 23, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
