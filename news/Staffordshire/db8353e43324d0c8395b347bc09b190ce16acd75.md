A woman who sadly died following a fatal road traffic collision in Burton-on-Trent earlier this week has been named.

Helen McQuone, 73, from Leicestershire, was pronounced dead at the scene of a collision involving two vehicles on Ashby Road at around 12.15pm on 2 December.

Colleagues from West Midlands Ambulance Service and Midlands Air Ambulance attended but sadly nothing could be done to save the woman and she was pronounced dead at the scene.

Helen's family said: "Helen was a glamorous woman who loved life and lived it to the full."

Specialist officers are supporting her family and have asked for privacy during this difficult time.

An investigation is on-going by officers from the Staffordshire and West Midlands Serious Collision Investigation unit and anyone with information is asked to get in touch.

Any witnesses or anyone with dash-cam footage is asked to call 101 quoting incident number 241 of 2 December or email ciu@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk.
