A man has been jailed for nine years after being found guilty of sexually assaulting a child.

Anthony Ainslie, also known as Tony Geo, 32, of no fixed abode, was found guilty of six counts of sexual assault and sentenced at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on Friday (8 January).

The offences took place in 2018 in Stoke-on-Trent.

Ainslie was arrested in November 2018.

Detective Constable Karen Wild, the investigating officer of the force's Child Protection and Exploitation Team, said: "Ainslie, who often called himself Tom Geo, seemed to think he could deny his way out of the serious allegation, and we are pleased that the jury delivered the guilty verdict.

"I hope that today's sentencing can bring an element of closure for the victim and their family."
