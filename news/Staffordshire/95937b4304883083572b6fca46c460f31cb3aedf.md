A senior police chief is appealing for people in Staffordshire to work together and follow the new 'Rule of Six' guidelines as efforts continue to prevent further spread of Covid19.

Assistant Chief Constable Justin Bibby, of Staffordshire Police, said it was important that people continued to follow the guidelines to prevent spread of Covid19 and praised people across the county for their efforts to date.

Under the government's guidelines (September 14) gatherings in any place of more than six people are prohibited, with certain exemptions.

ACC Bibby said officers across Staffordshire would continue to engage, explain and encourage people to follow the rules.

He added that fines would be issued when people refused to comply, but people across the county had been cooperative.

"We have had incidents to deal with, including the arrests we've made for planned raves in Lichfield and Cannock Chase, but on the whole people in Staffordshire have understood the importance of working together to prevent further spread.

"Our approach is very much to work with our communities across Staffordshire. People have been great, but we don't want a small minority to risk further spread of Covid19. We all need to work together to prevent the spread of Covid-19."
