An extended closure order has been granted on a property in Stone after repeated issues involving anti-social behaviour.

The house, on Kent Grove, was ordered to be shut at Cannock Magistrates court yesterday (12 November). This is valid until November 26 when a full hearing will be heard to decide whether the property should be closed for the maximum of three months.

The order was sought after repeated anti-social behaviour-related issues linked to the address despite repeated warnings. It prevents anybody except the owner from entering. If breached, the offender could be arrested.

Giles Parsons, Staffordshire Police's Neighbourhood and Partnerships Chief Inspector for the Stafford area, said: "This property has caused lots of problems for the local community with anti-social behaviour, links to crime and drugs.

"I am keen to ensure the community are reassured around positive action we are taking to resolve the problem. Also, I am keen for them to report any breaches of the order to us.

We continue to work hard to tackle anti-social behaviour issues impacting on our community, and where addresses continually and repeatedly cause issues, we will consider taking similar action."
