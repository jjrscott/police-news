The neighbourhood policing team in Stone is set to hold an online chat event to answer residents' questions and address any concerns.

The event, which is due to take place on Wednesday 10 March from 6pm to 8pm, will be hosted by Chief Inspector Giles Parsons and is available for sign up here: https://app.sli.do/event/h371amxa.

Participants can also submit questions in advance through following the link, even if they cannot attend on the night, with responses due to be published shortly after the event.

Chief Inspector Parsons, said: "We are hosting this event in order to continue to improve our engagement with people in Stone.

"We want to use this as an opportunity to answer the public's questions regarding policing in the town and to promote the positive action we have been taking regarding crime, drugs and anti-social behaviour.

"This will help us to make sure we continue to tackle the issues that matter most to the local community and we want to encourage the public to attend.

"Any information and intelligence given to us as a result of this event will assist officers in taking further action to address their concerns."

Sergeant Nick Maingay who is local sergeant for Stone will also be in attendance along with a local PC/PCSO.

Sergeant Nick Maingay added: "We would really appreciate the involvement of local residents in the online event and I would encourage as many people as possible to sign up so we can address issues directly and take away information in order to carry out further positive action.

"I'd like to thank the community in Stone for its ongoing support and we look forward to seeing and speaking to you on 10 March."
