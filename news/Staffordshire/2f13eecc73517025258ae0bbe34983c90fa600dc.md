A man's been left with serious facial and head injuries after being attacked in an alleyway behind Revolution Bar in Newcastle-under-Lyme.

The 23-year-old victim remains in hospital after he was set upon by a group of offenders - believed to be three men and a white woman - off Market Lane just before 11pm on Monday (30 December).

He had his phone and some cash stolen and sustained three fractures to his face and other head injuries - they are not believed to be life threatening.

Police are following numerous lines of enquiry and are asking for anyone who was in the town centre at the time of the attack to come forward - with focus on those near to Yates on Iron Market, to McDonalds on High Street or by Market Lane.

Anyone with any information is asked to email david.stubbs@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk or call 101 quoting incident number 728 of 30 December. You can alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
