A 39-year-old man has been charged with murder following the death of a woman in Burslem on Friday 6 November.

Lewis Crofts, of Broadstone, Dorset, has been remanded in custody and will appear before North Staffordshire Justice Centre on Monday morning (9 November).

Formal identification of the woman is still to take place, but she is believed to be Kimberley Deakin, aged 29, from Burslem. Kimberley and Lewis were known to each other.

Her family are being supported by specially-trained officers at this time and we would kindly urge people to respect their privacy.

A Home Office post mortem examination found the cause of Kimberley's death to be stab wounds.

Anyone with any information should call Staffordshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 430 of 6 November or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
