Detectives are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent.

At around 6pm on Sunday (1 November) it was reported that two men approached a 17-year-old boy as he walked through Central Forest Park near the skate park.

After asking for a cigarette, they made threats and showed a knife before stealing cash.

The suspects are described as approximately 19-20 years old, over 5ft 10ins tall, wearing dark clothing and masks.

Enquiries are on-going and any witnesses or anyone with information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter or call 101 quoting incident number 712 of 1 November. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
