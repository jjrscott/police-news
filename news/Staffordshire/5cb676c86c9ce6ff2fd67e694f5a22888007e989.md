A probation officer who had a relationship with a vulnerable offender that she managed has been jailed for ten months.

Victoria Sellar, 30, of Trevone Avenue, Stapleford, Nottingham, was sentenced to ten months' imprisonment on Thursday 8 October at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court after pleading guilty to misconduct in public office.

Sellar was arrested at her office on 26 October 2018 after officers examining a suspect's mobile phone found text messages and photos of a personal and sexual nature. An investigation showed the messages were from Sellar - the suspect's probation officer.

Detective Constable Dave Stubbs, of CID North, said: "I welcome the sentence imposed by the court today. Sellar abused her position as a Probation Officer and failed to carry out her duties and responsibilities to the criminal justice system and the public.

"By acting as she did she also let down her hard working colleagues who work tirelessly in keeping the public safe and who play a crucial role in the rehabilitation of offenders. It is important that the trust and confidence of the public is maintained and this sentence shows how seriously such offences are taken."
