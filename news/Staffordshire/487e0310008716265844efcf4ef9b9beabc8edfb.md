Volunteers who help to make the roads of Staffordshire a safer place handed out 1,777 warning letters to motorists at the start of this year.

A total of 369 volunteers across 69 areas make up the Community Speed Watch scheme and gave up over 250 hours of their own time between January and March.

In those three months, 236 sessions were carried over by the volunteers.

The national initiative sees local residents monitor speeds of vehicles in their local area using a speed detection device with the aim of raising awareness and preventing speeders on their local roads.

Volunteers record speeders on a log sheet and submit it to Staffordshire Police. Once the details have been checked, a letter is sent to the registered keeper warning them of the dangers of speeding. If a driver ignores repeated warnings, the force will take further action.

Along with monitoring speeds, the volunteers recorded nine drivers using a mobile phone and several vehicles with no insurance.

Staffordshire Police has a total of 930 volunteers, comprising of cadets, cadet leaders, special constables, chaplains, vehicle fleet support, rural crime, independent advisory groups and community engagement volunteers.

Assistant Chief Constable Simon Tweats said: "The Community Speed Watch volunteers do a remarkable job by giving up their own time to help make the roads of Staffordshire a safer place to be.

"The members have given up their own time which is utterly selfless. All of our volunteers play a vital role in policing and help Staffordshire Police to prevent crime and above all, keep everyone safe."
