Detectives investigating the death of a two-month-old baby girl in October have arrested a woman.

Police were called to a report of a child in cardiac arrest by colleagues from West Midlands Ambulance Service at an address in Blurton just before 6am on 25 October.

The child was taken to hospital where she sadly died a few days later on 29 October.

An investigation is continuing and enquiries are on-going. A post mortem was inconclusive and further tests are required.

A 29-year-old woman from Stoke-on-Trent was arrested on suspicion of murder. She has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.
