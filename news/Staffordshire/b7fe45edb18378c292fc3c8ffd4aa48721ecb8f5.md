Updated News Post

Police are now in a position to name the motorcyclist who died following a collision in Cheadle yesterday morning (23 April).

William Langham, aged 28, from the Trentham area of Stoke-on-Trent, was riding his orange coloured Honda motorcycle along Cheltenham Avenue towards Ness Grove at around 8:40am, when he came off the bike and sustained serious injuries.

No other vehicle is believed to have been involved and despite the efforts of passers-by and the West Midlands Ambulance Service, William was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

Specialist officers are supporting his family and they have asked that their privacy is respected at this difficult time.

Officers from the Staffordshire and West Midlands Serious Collision Investigation Unit are appealing for witnesses who have not yet spoken with them to contact 101 quoting incident 121 of 23 April or email ciu@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk.

We would like to remind the public not to speculate on social media with regards to the cause or circumstances of the collision.
