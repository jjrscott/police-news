A 31-year-old man from Stafford has been jailed after being found guilty of carrying out a tyranny of abuse against a woman.

Joshua Lockley, formerly of Tithe Barn Road, Stafford was arrested and charged after being detained by officers in November 2019.

Police had been called to a property in the Forebridge area of Stafford following reports Lockley had stamped on his victim's stomach.

Appearing at Stafford Crown Court this morning, he was sentenced to six years and ten months in jail - with a further one year on license after being found guilty of two counts of assault occasioning bodily harm and one count of controlling and coercive behaviour.

He's also been issued with a ten year restraining order.

Detective Constable Joanne Kirkland of Staffordshire Police said: "We are pleased with the court's decision to hand out such a strong sentence to Lockley - who put his victim through a number of horrific ordeals throughout 2019.

"We also want to praise his victim for showing the courage to come forward to help us with our investigation.

"This sentence should act as a real warning to those who choose to carry out these offences. You will be found and you will be prosecuted."
