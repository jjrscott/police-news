A man who started a fire at the George Bryan Centre in Tamworth last year has been given an indefinite hospital order under the Mental Health Act.

Zoltan Rozsa, 44, of no fixed address, appeared at Stafford Crown Court on Monday (16 March).

Based on medical evidence, the defendant was found not fit to enter a plea.

He previously appeared at the same court for a trial of facts on 4 February. Judge Michael Chambers QC instructed jurors that they would need to decide whether Mr Rozsa "set the fire at the George Bryan Centre". The jury found that Rozsa did start the fire.

Emergency services were called to the centre at 9.15pm on 11 February 2019 to reports that a fire had broken out in the west wing of the hospital. Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service believed it to be arson. The fire was started in Room 18 where Rozsa was staying. His mattress had been turned on its side with a blanket on top which was on fire.

DC Gareth Morris, the investigating officer from CID South, said: "Rozsa's actions resulted in extensive damage to the west wing of the centre, putting lives at risk.

"Thankfully, there were no fatalities and all occupants and staff were evacuated from the centre and transferred to other local medical centres."
