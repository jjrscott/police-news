A Burton man has been remanded on bail to appear before magistrates and face charges for racially aggravated offences - having failed to appear for his original trial date.

Matab Ali, 27, of Weston Park Avenue, was originally charged with racially aggravated assault by beating and racially aggravated public order of using threatening words/behaviour with intent to cause fear or provoke unlawful violence over an altercation. It occurred in Edward Street with a local council civil enforcement officer who was providing a parking ticket to a vehicle belonging to somebody the defendant knew on 13 October 2020.

He was bailed to appear at South Derbyshire Magistrates' Court on Monday 4 January but failed to appear.

A warrant was issued and executed the following day. Ali was further charged and remanded for failing to appear at court.

He then appeared on 6 January at North Staffordshire Magistrates where the case was heard as a sitting of Derbyshire Magistrates.

He pleaded guilty to all three charges and was granted conditional bail to appear before Cannock Magistrates Court on 3 February.
