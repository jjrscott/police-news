Detectives are continuing to investigate this morning following the discovery of two bodies at a property in Burton

Emergency services were called to a house on Henhurst Hill, at around 11.05pm last night (4 September).

The bodies of a 32-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman were discovered at the address.

A 2-year-old child was found unharmed at the property.

The deaths are being treated as unexplained at this time and post mortems will take place in due course. Formal identification has not yet taken place.

A cordon is in place as forensic enquiries continue and detectives work to establish the circumstances around the deaths.

Local neighbourhood officers will be in the area today completing door-to-door enquiries and provide reassurance to the local community.

Anyone with information is asked to contact 101, quoting incident number 790 of 4 September. Alternatively, for guaranteed anonymity, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
