Detectives have issued CCTV images of a man they want to speak to in connection with a robbery at a petrol station near Lichfield.

An investigation is currently underway after the Shell garage on the A38 Southbound at Fradley was targeted at around 4:40pm on Sunday 17 January.

It's reported a man entered the store before threatening staff and demanding cash. It's then believed he made off on foot towards Fradley.

He was described as white, skinny, about 5'6" \- 5'7" tall, wearing a green parker-style coat and a black scarf or mask covering the lower part of his face.

No staff were harmed.

A man matching the description of the suspect was seen on Fradley Lane, in the area close to the bridge over the A38, shortly before the incident occurred.

Any witnesses or anyone with any information is asked to message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter, quoting incident number 499 of 17 January, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
