A woman and two teenage boys have been arrested as part of a proactive policing operation to crackdown on drug crime.

A 17-year-old boy, from Burton-on-Trent, was arrested on suspicion of possession of controlled drugs with intent to supply following a stop and search on Cornwall Road at around 11am yesterday (17 September). A quantity of drugs, believed to be Class A, were seized.

A few hours later, at around 1.30pm, a teenager boy was stopped and searched on Ordish Street after a short foot chase with officers and found with suspected Class A drugs. Cash and phones were seized. A 17-year-old from Birmingham was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class A.

A 28-year-old woman, from Nottingham, was arrested on suspicion of possession of controlled drugs with intent to supply a few hours later after officers stopped a vehicle on Horninglow Road at around 2.30pm. Cash, phones and suspected Class A drugs were found and seized.

All three have been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

The arrests were part of Staffordshire Police's Operation Disrupt, which aims to crack down on criminal activity across Staffordshire such as serious and violent crime and drugs.

The operation, led by the Disruptions Team, consists of hotspot policing, stop and search activity and targeting of wanted offenders.
