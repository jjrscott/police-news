A man's been charged after a stabbing in Biddulph.

It's after officers received reports a man had been sliced in the hand outside a block of flats on John Street shortly before 10am yesterday (7 December).

A man in his 40s was assessed and treated by colleagues at West Midlands Ambulance Service before being taken to hospital.

18-year-old Levi Murray of Slater Street, Biddulph was arrested and later charged on suspicion of wounding with intent, possession of an offensive weapon and attempted robbery. He has since been remanded in custody following an appearance at North Staffordshire Justice Centre this morning.

A 40-year-old woman from Biddulph was also arrested on suspicion of attempted robbery. She's since been released on police bail while investigations continue.
