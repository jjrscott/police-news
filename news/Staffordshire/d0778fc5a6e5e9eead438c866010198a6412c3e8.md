A 30-year-old Stafford man has been jailed for four years after his parcel of drugs was intercepted.

Stafford Crown Court heard that a box of cannabis destined for Michael Hayer's home address in Meadowcroft Park had been seized by Border Force officers on 18 March this year.

Following a search at his house in Daimler Close on 3 April officers from Stafford Neighbourhood Policing Team found 160 grams of cocaine and 1.1kg of cannabis.

A drugs expert valued the cocaine and cannabis at around Â£18,200, but potentially much more if the cocaine was broken into street deals.

The cannabis and cocaine were found in supermarket carrier bags. Hayer said that white powder found in bulk in his garage was benzocaine (a known cutting agent for cocaine). Officers also seized drugs bags and mobile phones with evidence of drugs transactions on them.

Hayer was found guilty of possession with intent to supply cocaine and cannabis at Stafford Crown Court on 1 May.

He was sentenced on Friday (May 29) to three years for possessing cocaine with intent to supply and a further 12 months for the cannabis supply.

Sergeant Tom Fotherby, of Stafford Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "The interception of the parcel led to a significant find of cannabis and cocaine. Working with colleagues form Border Force we were able to secure this conviction."
