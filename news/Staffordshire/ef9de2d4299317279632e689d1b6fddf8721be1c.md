Officers cracking down on the condition of vehicles on the county's motorway network stopped a number of motorists and discovered a number of offences including bald tyres and unsafe, overweight loads.

Central Motorway Policing Group (CMPG) were assisted by colleagues from Highways England and Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency at its Doxey base yesterday (10 January) where officers spot-checked multiple vehicles travelling between junction 13 and 15 on the M6.

In just two hours, CMPG found: five bald tyres and three overweight vehicles, handed out a prohibition for a broken brake cable, issued one speeding ticket, discovered one levy unpaid, issued one vehicle defect rectification notice and two due care offences, handed out one prohibition for the condition of a vehicle and dealt with two drivers for no seat belts.

The exercise was part of Staffordshire Police's Operation Lightning, aiming to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries on the county's roads.

Sergeant Robert Gilligan, of Central Motorway Police Group, said: "These operations are centred around road safety and ensuring the vehicles on our motorway network are road-worthy.

"We spoke to a number of drivers and thoroughly checked vehicles during the operation. Though vehicle defects may seem minor to some - they can cost a life if the vehicle needed to stop drastically in the event of a near-collision.

"Drivers have a responsibility to make sure their vehicles are safe for the roads and we'll continue to crack down on any that aren't."
