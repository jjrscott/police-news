A 22-year-old man from Stoke-on-Trent has been jailed after being found with 22 wraps of crack cocaine.

Niasar Ahmed of Butler Street, was arrested at a guest house in Hanley after officers followed up on some intelligence.

Officers seized the drugs and related paraphernalia - including hundreds of pounds in cash, scales and mobile phones - before arresting and charging Ahmed with possession with intent to supply a controlled Class A drug.

He was this week sentenced to 30 months in prison at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court. Ahmed was also forced to forfeit Â£705 in cash whilst the drugs and scales were destroyed.

Ahmed's partner, 18-year-old Kayleigh Murphy from Hanley, was also charged with possession with intent to supply a control class A drug but these charges were dropped.

PC Ian Prendergast, from the Stoke South Neighbourhood Policing team, said: "This sentencing is further proof of the great work our officers are doing in combatting those intent on circulating drugs around our communities.

"My message to those who continue to bring drugs onto our streets is simple - we will continue to stamp out what you're doing and, if found guilty, you will be prosecuted."
