Police are investigating after a member of the public reported seeing a young boy running alone in the Cobridge area at approximately 5.30am this morning (Tuesday 8 September).

It was reported that the child, believed to be aged around four or five-years-old, was running down an alleyway from Emerson Road into Bursley Road. He is reported to have black hair and was reportedly wearing a blue and orange striped jacket, dark jogging bottoms and trainers.

Enquiries have shown that there is nothing to suggest anything untoward and there have been no reports of missing young children in Staffordshire today.

Officers have been searching neighbouring streets and land, speaking to residents in the area and checking CCTV. There is footage of a woman running down the alleyway at 5.40am but further checks of CCTV are taking place.

Detective Sergeant Abi Shore, of CID North, said: "There is nothing to suggest anything untoward has happened to the boy but we need to know that he is safe and well.

"Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 92 of 8 September, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
