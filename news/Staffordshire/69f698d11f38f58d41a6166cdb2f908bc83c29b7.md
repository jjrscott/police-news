Officers from Newcastle Neighbourhood Policing Team are urging anyone who is considering attending a large gathering in the Kidsgrove area tonight (Friday 3 July) not to as it is illegal and not safe.

The force is aware that there is a possible large gathering being planned for this evening.

There will be a dedicated policing operation in place, with a higher police presence in hot spot areas. Action will be taken to ensure that the gathering does not take place, with a dispersal order also in force.

A 15-year-old boy has been detained and interviewed by officers this afternoon about the gathering.

Chief Superintendent Carl Ratcliffe, Head of Contact and Response, said: "Following intelligence, officers will be patrolling the Kidsgrove area tonight to tackle any instances of crime and anti-social behaviour.

"Large gatherings of this type are illegal and present significant risks to the health of individuals in the current climate.

"Action will be taken against those organising these unlawful events. We will identify and arrest them and seek to prosecute wherever possible.

"I am appealing directly to parents and guardians to ensure that they know where their children are, what they are up to and who they are with. Please prevent your children from attending this potential gathering.''

Anyone with any concerns can contact Staffordshire Police by calling 101, reporting online at https://www.staffordshire.police.uk/report or sending a direct message on Facebook or Twitter.
