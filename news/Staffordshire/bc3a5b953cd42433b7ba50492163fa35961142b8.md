Speeding motorists and unsafe vehicles were among those targeted during a road safety operation.

Staffordshire Police's Road Policing Unit carried out speed checks along the A50 in Uttoxeter while a checkpoint was set up in the town where officers could inspect a host of vehicles.

During the operation, which took place over a four-hour period on Tuesday, officers monitored the A50 where 38 motorists were caught exceeding the speed limit - including one vehicle recorded travelling at 95mph.

In addition, the force carried out a number of vehicle checks where 17 offences were recorded including expired MOT, insecure loads, no tax or insurance, and HGV drivers exceeding their hours. Three vehicles were also found to be carrying excessive loads.

Sergeant James Hunt, of the Road Policing Unit, said: "These operations are carried out to help keep our roads safe - and stop drivers from using vehicles which are dangerous.

"When a van or truck is carrying too much it becomes hard to manage and therefore the chances of it being involved in a road traffic collision are increased. The same can be said for loads which are not secure as items falling from vehicles can cause serious problems. We must also ensure that HGV drivers are taking the correct number of breaks.

"It was also disappointing to see so many drivers ignoring the speed limit on the A50 - especially given the current conditions on the roads. Those who ignored the limit will soon receive details in the post of how they will be dealt with."
