Two men have been jailed after they broke into a house and bound and gagged a women during an attempted robbery.

Rhys Chesworth, 22, of Walton Grange, Stafford Road, Stone, was sentenced to 10 years and six months and Karta Slack, 30, of Brookwood Drive, Meir, Stoke-on-Trent, was sentenced to nine years and four months. Both were sentenced yesterday (7 November) at Stafford Crown Court after pleading guilty to attempted robbery at an earlier hearing.

Slack also admitted to possessing an offensive weapon in a public place and obstructing/resisting a police officer.

Shortly after 7am on 14 May 2019, the pair broke into a house in the Lichfield Road area of Stone. One wore a balaclava and the other had clothing disguising the lower half of his face.

Armed with a crowbar, they went upstairs and threatened the woman who was in her bedroom and demanded cash. They then bound and gagged her before running off empty handed after hearing a vehicle outside. The woman was not injured during the incident.

DC Robert Hadgett, of CID, said: "Police responded quickly after taking the report and arrested Slack near to the scene. A combination of information gathered in the initial stages of the enquiry and further work by detectives identified Chesworth as a suspect. We are grateful for the prompt action of the member of the public who contacted us to report the incident.

"This was a shocking crime where a young woman was targeted in her own home and, while she was not injured, she was left very distressed by the incident."
