We are investigating a report that three men were subjected to racist language and threatening behaviour at a pub in Wombourne on Saturday (July 11).

The men, who are described as Asian, were drinking at Wombourne Pool Bar at around 10:45pm when one of them was approached and warned to leave.

A short time afterwards a man approached the men and spat beer over one of them.

The three men are believed to have been training at a local cricket club.

Sergeant Kelly Wareing, of Staffordshire Police, said: "We'd urge these men to come forward, as well as anyone else who witnessed this incident.

"We are investigating and have already spoken to a local man in connection with this incident."

Anyone with information is urged to contact Staffordshire Police on 101 or via social media, referring to incident 741 of 14 July.
