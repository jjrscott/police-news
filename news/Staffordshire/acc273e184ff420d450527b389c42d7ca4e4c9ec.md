Three men have been arrested within 20 minutes of a call being received by the police about two robberies in Stoke-on-Trent.

The group - aged 27, 31 and 38 - were detained by officers responding to calls from the Co-op and Tesco supermarkets on Church Street in Audley at around 8.20 this morning.

Staff at the stores say they were threatened but were unhurt.

Arresting officers - who are searching through CCTV footage - recovered two broken bottles of Champagne.

The trio - arrested on suspicion of robbery - remain in custody.
