The Special Constabulary's new Chief Officer has joined Staffordshire Police. Tony Athersmith brings a huge amount of experience to the Specials from his career working in a variety of roles across the public and private sector including the NHS, DHL, Arriva Transport Solutions and West Midlands Ambulance Service.

Tony, who currently works for DHL as senior transition manager, is on secondment within NHS Services where he leads the implementation and development agenda for all hospital logistics services including transport, couriers and patient transport service.

In his spare time, Tony was recently an assistant coach for the Great Britain American Football national team where he also mentored players, teams and coaches both across the country and the world.

He says of his appointment: "I am delighted to have been selected as Chief Officer and I'm looking forward to both the challenges and the opportunities that this role will bring.

"Policing has always been a big passion of mine and I'm keen to get started and begin working on a number of opportunities including enabling the Specials to grow and develop as individuals, wider recruitment, working with all stakeholders and the communities we serve and establishing how we make the team even better."

Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims said: "The Special Constabulary and the work it brings has never been so important to policing and all of their work is valued by both colleagues from the force and local communities.

"I am delighted to announce Tony's arrival and I'm sure he will bring a vast amount of experience and energy to the role and continue to build and develop the great work of the Special Constabulary."
