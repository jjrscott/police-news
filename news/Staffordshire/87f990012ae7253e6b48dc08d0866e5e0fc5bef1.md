Officers are appealing for witnesses to an incident in a Tamworth toy store where a customer became aggressive and assaulted a member of staff.

A CCTV image is now being circulated of a man police wish to speak to about the incident, which happened at about 5.10pm on Friday (19 February) at the Smyths store on the Ventura Retail Park on Ventura Park Road.

A white male described as 5ft and 7 or 8in tall with a goatee-style beard and wearing a black cap, black, large, puffy coat and black tracksuit bottoms became aggressive with staff when trying to make a purchase.

After trying to purchase online via his mobile phone according to current coronavirus restrictions, the man and staff became involved in a disagreement over whether payment had successfully been taken. He barged past the member of staff, picked up the toys he said he had purchased at a value of approximately Â£30, punched the member of staff in the head and then left, believed to be on foot. The staff member did not require medical assistance.

If anybody recognises the man in the picture, or witnessed what happened, send a direct message to Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter or anonymously contact the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
