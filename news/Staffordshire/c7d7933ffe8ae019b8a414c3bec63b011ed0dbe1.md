Officers are appealing for information after two fires took place in Stone.

Police were first called by Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service at 7.30pm on Friday 29 January, to a property on Newcastle Street, following reports of a fire.

Officers attended and found a small fire at the property, where minimal damage was reported.

Police were called again shortly before 4am on Saturday 30 January to a vacant property on Granville Terrace.

Officers attended, again, after being alerted by Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service.

No one was reported injured and CCTV footage in relation to both incidents is being reviewed.

An investigation into the cause of each fire is currently underway.

Chief Inspector Giles Parsons, of Stafford Neighbourhood Policing Team (NPT), said: "Officers are increasing patrols of the local area to reassure the community and would encourage anyone who sees any suspicious activity to report this to police."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident numbers 551 of 29 January and 119 of 30 January.
