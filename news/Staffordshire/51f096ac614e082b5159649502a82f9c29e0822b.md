A 20-year-old man has been charged with grievous bodily harm with intent (GBH) after a 15-year-old boy suffered potentially life-changing injuries in a collision in Longton.

The victim sustained a fractured skull, broken thigh and shoulder injury after being struck by the car on Baths Road at around 6.30pm on Sunday (25 October).

He remains in a stable condition in hospital.

Jack Barter, of Uttoxeter Road, Meir, was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of attempted murder, but later charged with GBH, causing serious injury by driving and driving without insurance.

He has been remanded in custody and is due to appear before magistrates at North Staffordshire Justice Centre later today (30 October).

A 17-year-old boy, previously arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent, was later released under investigation.

On Tuesday, a girl, 15, arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, was released under investigation.

Another man, aged 31, arrested on Thursday on suspicion of attempted murder, was also released under investigation while inquires continue.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Staffordshire Police quoting incident number 609 of 25 October.
