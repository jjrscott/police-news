A Burton-on-Trent man has been jailed for 11 years after stabbing a man in the eye.

Jalan Gordon, of Aviation Lane, was sentenced at Stafford Crown Court on Monday (6 January), after pleading guilty to grievous bodily harm, witness intimidation and possession of a blade.

The court heard that Gordon was involved in several altercations with his victim before stabbing him in the face on April 27 last year, on Oak Road, in Barton-under-Needwood, leaving serious injuries and potentially blinding him in the right eye. The incident was recorded on the defendant's phone on a social media account and the footage was found by officers.

The 20-year-old was later also arrested for intimidation after attempting to threaten the victim using Snapchat, stating 'Snitch get Stitches' on 28 April 2019.

Detective Constable Gareth Morris, of CID, said: "We are very pleased with the sentenced handed down by the court. This was a very serious offence causing life altering injuries to the man he attacked and we are glad to see a violent man taken off the streets.

"Hopefully, this serves as a warning to other violent offenders that this type of violence will not be tolerated in Staffordshire."
