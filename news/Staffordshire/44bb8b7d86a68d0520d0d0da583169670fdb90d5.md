Yesterday evening (Sept 19), just after 9pm, we were alerted to the discovery of a woman's body in Roman Way, Tamworth.

We have cordoned off three areas for forensic examination as work continues to understand the circumstances around the woman's death.

We would politely request that people refrain from speculating as to the circumstances of the woman's death as we continue to investigate.

A Home Office post mortem will take place in due course.

A 19-year-old man from Tamworth has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is in custody.
