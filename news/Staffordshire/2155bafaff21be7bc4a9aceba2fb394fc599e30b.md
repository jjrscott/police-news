Detectives investigating disorder in Stoke town centre are asking for help to identify four men.

Just before 1am on Saturday 30 November 2019, police were alerted to a disturbance outside Georgia Browns pub on Church Street.

Two groups of men were fighting and a 30-year-old suffered serious facial injuries.

Officers arrested a 25-year-old man from Stoke-on-Trent on suspicion of assault GBH with intent. He was released under investigation. Two other men have been voluntarily interviewed in connection with the offence.

Enquiries are on-going, and detectives are keen to trace the men captured on CCTV as they may be able to help with the investigation.
