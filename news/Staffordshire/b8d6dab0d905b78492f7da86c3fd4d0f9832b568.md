A Burton man has been jailed for 40 months for setting fire to his flat in the town in April.

Samuel Powell, aged 30, was jailed at Stafford Crown Court yesterday (Aug 10) after admitting arson with intent to endanger life.

The court heard that Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service received a call to a property in Blackpool Street, Burton, at 4.30am on 13 April.

Powell made the call stating he'd set fire to the flat and there were people inside. Police were called and Powell was found sitting outside his first floor flat. Fire crews put out the blaze which was in a bedroom of the flat.

After hospital treatment for smoke inhalation, Powell was arrested and admitted the offence. He said he had been trying to clear people from his flat.

Detective Inspector Beverley Matthews, of Staffordshire Police, said: "A family were living below this flat so it could have had serious, tragic consequences. Thankfully firefighters were able to put out the blaze and Powell has been jailed after admitting what he did that night."
