The Home Office has today confirmed the officer recruitment targets for every police force in England and Wales for the first year of the national drive to recruit a further 20,000 officers over the next three years. This equates to 6,000 new police officers in the first wave, which will mean a further 90 officers by the end of 2020/21 for Staffordshire Police.

Chief Constable Gareth Morgan said: "I welcome the confirmation today by Government of the actual number of officers each local force will increase by, which means a further 90 officers for Staffordshire by the end of 2020/21. This uplift will accelerate our existing recruitment plans, which will see the force recruit 180 officers in 2019-20 following the increase in the council tax precept funding and to fill existing vacancies. These plans stepped up a gear earlier this year when we launched a new partnership with Staffordshire University to support entry routes into policing for those who will work and gain a degree and for those who will join with existing degree level qualifications.

"It is important that Government has recognised the reduction in police numbers has to be addressed and has provided funding to enable this to happen so that we have the capacity and capability to tackle the increasingly complex world of crime and make a positive difference serving the public in our community."
