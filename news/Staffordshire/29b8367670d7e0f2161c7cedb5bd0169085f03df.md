Officers are appealing for information after the theft and attempted theft of catalytic converters in Cannock.

Police were called at 8.45pm on Thursday (28 January) to Stirling Place in Cannock following reports of a man seen interfering with a vehicle parked on a driveway.

The victim, a 65-year-old man, confronted two offenders dressed in black, wearing masks, who were spotted laying down by the rear-side of the blue Honda Jazz.

When confronted, the victim was threatened before the offenders made off in a small silver vehicle, believed to be a Seat, in the direction of Sandy Lane.

The victim's car sustained damage to its exhaust, though the converter remained in-tact.

The men involved are described as Asian and in their 30s, wearing black clothing and face masks.

It comes as a similar offence was reported on Thursday 21 January.

Officers were called to an address on Devon Road in Rumer Hill, Cannock, at about 7.40pm following reports of a theft between 8.30pm and 9pm on Wednesday 20 January.

The victim, an 80-year-old male, said his neighbour had reported hearing noises during the evening.

When he started his car, the next morning, he heard unusual sounds and later noticed the converter was gone from his black Honda vehicle.

Anyone with information is asked to message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident numbers 630 of 28 January and 701 of 21 January.

Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
