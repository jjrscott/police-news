Officers are releasing an image of a second male they wish to speak to in relation to an incident where a tent was set on fire in Longton, Stoke-on-Trent at around 8.15pm on December 29, 2020.

While a woman was in the tent at the time of the incident, she fortunately suffered no injuries.

An investigation was subsequently launched by CID and a 16-year-old was later arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life. He was bailed with conditions while enquiries continued.

This new image shows another male police wish to speak to in relation to the incident, also believed to be a teenager.

Staffordshire Police have also worked closely with partner agencies to support the woman and offered her alternative accommodation, along with ongoing help and support.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 0637 of December 29, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
