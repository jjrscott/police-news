A 35-year-old woman's been sentenced to five years behind bars after pleading guilty to a number of drugs offences.

Stacey Doolan - of no fixed address - was handed the term after admitting two charges of possessing heroin with intent to supply and a further charge of possessing cocaine with intent to supply.

She also admitted possessing monkey dust at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court.

PC Matt Walklett of Staffordshire Police's Stoke North NST said: "This is an excellent sentence and one which we're very happy with.

"It's a real sign that those who look to deal drugs in our county will be dealt with accordingly - and their actions won't be tolerated."
