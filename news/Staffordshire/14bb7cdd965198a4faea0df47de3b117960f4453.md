A 24-year-old man has been jailed for 40 months after police found heroin in a search in Stafford.

Ben Miles was jailed at Stafford Crown Court after being found guilty of possessing heroin with intent to supply in Stafford. He was also found guilty of offering to supply heroin.

The court heard that neighbourhood officers from Stafford police station were executing a warrant at a flat above a shop in Wolverhampton Road, close to the town centre, in the afternoon of 21 March 2019.

Miles was at the flat where officers seized cash, mobile phones, scales, and a brown substance believed to be heroin.

He was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class-A drugs.

The substance was later analysed and found to be 20.12 grams of heroin.

Sergeant Tom Fotherby, of Stafford Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We are glad Ben Miles has been sentenced as his activities were having an impact in Stafford and Stone.

"We want to send out a clear message that we will not tolerate dealing and will bring offenders before the courts."

Miles was jailed on Tuesday (20 October).
