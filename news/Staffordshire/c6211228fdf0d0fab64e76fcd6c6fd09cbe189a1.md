Officers have executed a warrant at a house seizing drugs, made two arrests and dealt with three suspected shoplifters as Operation Disrupt continues in Cannock today (1 Oct).

An address in Heath Hayes was raided this morning and cannabis was seized along with drugs paraphernalia.

The raid took place as part of Operation Disrupt, which is running across the county and resulted in 77 arrests in its first week.

Cannabis vegetation was seized at the address, along with grinders, digital scales and bags. A 50-year-old woman is assisting us with enquiries.

Officers also arrested a Chadsmoor man, aged 39, wanted on a recall to prison and a Cannock man, aged 47, on a fail to appear warrant.

A 42-year-old man from Walsall, and a 36-year-old man from Hednesford and 44-year-old man from Cannock were all reported for suspected shoplifting.

Chief Inspector Becky Hyde, area commander for Cannock Chase Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "Officers have been busy dealing with a range of suspected crimes from shoplifting to drug supply. We have made arrests and reported suspected offenders as Operation Disrupt continues."
