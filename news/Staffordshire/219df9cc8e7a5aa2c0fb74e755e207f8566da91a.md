A 20-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a cyclist was hit by a car in Brewood.

The collision took place on Tinkers Lane at about 1.30pm on Sunday (8 Nov).

The male victim, aged 77, was not seriously injured, but suffered bruising after being struck by a black Fiat 500 and going into a hedgerow.

The arrested man was detained following an allegation that the driver deliberately collided with the cyclist.

DCI David Wain said: "Thanks to the team's hard work, a male from Penkridge, was arrested in the early hours of the morning.

"He remains in police custody while inquiries continue."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Staffordshire Police on 101, quoting incident number 472 of 8 November or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
