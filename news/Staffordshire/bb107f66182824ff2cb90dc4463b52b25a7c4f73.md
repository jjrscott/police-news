A 34-year-old man who burgled properties in Stafford and Cannock has been jailed for 45 months.

Ian Shepperd was caught after he was chased from a property in Weston, near Stafford, and found nearby on a canal towpath.

Stafford Crown Court heard that at 5am on 2 May dogs began barking at a property in Weston and a man was chased down the road near to the Saracen's Head pub. The man ran into a wooded area to hide.

A few miles away, at 8.45am, further along the towpath at Great Haywood, Shepperd was arrested on suspicion of burglary after he matched the description of the man given at Weston.

Another householder in Weston woke to find they had been burgled and a set of boot prints on a ledge were a good match for Shepperd's footwear.

There was a further offence disclosed in Progress Drive, Huntington, near Cannock, where a bike, iPads and a light fitting were taken. The offences took place overnight between 30 April and 2 May.

Shepperd pleaded guilty to burglary and attempted burglary and was sentenced to a total of 45 months on 25 June at Stafford Crown Court.

A search of Shepperd's address in Stafford Road, Huntington, led to the discovery of items including light fittings from the nearby burglary.

Detective Inspector Beverley Matthews, of Staffordshire Police, said: "Shepperd targeted houses and cars in Stafford and Cannock. We're grateful to the witnesses and the support that led to us making this arrest and putting Shepperd before the courts."
