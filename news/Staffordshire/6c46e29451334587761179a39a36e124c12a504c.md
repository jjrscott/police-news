A 17-year-old boy has been charged after a man was stabbed in the leg in Abbey Hulton on Monday night.

We were called at 9.15pm on 5 October to reports that a 20-year-old man had been stabbed in the leg on Abbey Road, Abbey Hulton. He was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

The boy, from Stoke-on-Trent, was arrested and has been charged with grievous bodily harm with intent, robbery, being concerned in the supply of Class B drugs and having a bladed weapon in a public place.

He is due to appear before magistrates at the North Staffordshire Justice Centre this morning (8 October).
