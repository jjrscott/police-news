An 83-year-old man has been jailed for 17 years after pleading guilty to non-recent serious sexual offences involving children.

Antony Busfield, of Sutherland Road, Longsdon, was sentenced on 5 March at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court after pleading guilty to 19 sexual offences.

He was arrested at his home in December 2017.

Busfield pleaded guilty to all counts at a previous hearing in August 2019. He admitted the rape of a boy under 13, three counts of engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child under 13 and engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child under 16.

He also pleaded guilty to three counts of causing/inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, four counts of sexual assault of a boy under 13, sexual activity with a boy under 16, five counts of cause a child under 13 to watch a sexual act and attempted sexual assault of child under 13.

A Sexual Harm Prevention Order has been imposed on Busfield for 10 years. He will also be required to sign the Sex Offenders Register for life.

DI Adrian Webb, from CID North said: "I hope the victims in this case can take some comfort from the outcome at court, knowing that justice has been served and Busfield has been jailed for a significant length of time.

"Importantly, it also demonstrates that it is never too late for victims to report such terrible crimes."
