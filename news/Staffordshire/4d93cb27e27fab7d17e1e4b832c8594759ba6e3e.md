A family have paid tribute to a man who sadly died after falling from a bridge in Burton-on-Trent on Tuesday.

Isaac Ahmed, 28, from Burton-on-Trent, died after falling from the Hillfield Lane bridge on the northbound carriageway of the A38 in Stretton.

Officers received a report of a man in distress on a bridge at around 6.45am. It is believed the man fell from the bridge and collided with a BMW car.

His family said: "Thank you all for the love and support shown for Isaac, it has been amazing. Isaac was a loveable rogue who was known by everyone in Burton.

"Remember him for his infectious smile and for the wonderful times we all shared. We will not forget him.

"At moments like this in life, it shows how close a community can be and the amount of people Isaac interacted with in his short life. May he rest in peace."

His family are currently being supported by specially-trained officers at this difficult time.

Officers from the Staffordshire and West Midlands Serious Collision Investigation Unit are continuing to investigate the collision on behalf of the Coroner and are continuing to ask anyone with information to come forward.

Any witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage are asked to get in touch by either calling 101 quoting incident number 78 of 21 January or by emailing the investigation team direct on ciu@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk.
