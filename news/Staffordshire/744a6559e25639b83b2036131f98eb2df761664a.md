Chief Constable Gareth Morgan said: "We fully support the new measures announced by the Government to increase social distancing and recognise the significance and impact of these decisions.

"The majority of people are already making real sacrifices to save lives and I am confident that the people of Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent will follow the advice that is designed to keep us all safe.

"We are aware of the proposed legislation in relation to coronavirus and are carefully considering the implications in this very fast moving situation to consider how these new rules can be most effectively enforced. However I fully expect the vast majority of the public to heed the guidance and put others before themselves in the public interest. "

"We recognise that people may well be anxious and uncertain and so we will be increasing police patrols in key areas across the county to provide reassurance and guidance to anyone about the new measures."
