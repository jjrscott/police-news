A police officer who suffered serious injuries when she was run down on duty has donated £1,500 from fundraising activities to buy equipment for a hospital.

PC Claire Bond was on duty on 23 September 2018 when she was run down and suffered two breaks to her left leg and serious injury to her right knee.
The man responsible was arrested shortly afterwards and jailed for 12 years for wounding last September.

Claire attended ward 226 at the Royal Stoke Hospital along with Temporary Chief Constable Nick Baker and the Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire Ian Dudson (Feb 11) to donate £1,500 collected in fundraising activities.

The money has been used to provide 16 foot stools, plaster cast equipment and ice-packs for physiotherapy.

Claire's colleagues, led by Zoe Smith at Cannock, raised £500 through a raffle and another £1,000 was raised when Claire's husband Darren - a serving officer in West Midlands Police - and other colleagues from the Control room completed the X-runner event in Nottingham.

Claire said she was grateful to staff on ward 226 who, not only treated her injures, but provided support and care for her family.

"I was keen to say thank you and to try and help make the ward a more comfortable place for people."

She is making good progress and hopes to return to work with Staffordshire Police following further assessment in March.

"I've got further fundraising plans in store with the hospital. I want to keep busy, but I want us to get back to normality," she added.

Temporary Chief Constable Nick Baker, of Staffordshire Police, said: "Claire has made great progress and her positive attitude is inspiring to all of us. She suffered a terrible injury while doing her job and selflessly trying to protect the public.

"Even while she's working to get better she's still thinking of how she can help others. We're very proud of her and her fundraising work."
