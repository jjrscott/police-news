An office manager from Burton has been jailed for three and a half years after admitting making more than 6,000 images and videos of children.

Paul Nicholas Willetts, 46, of Burton, was sentenced today (Monday 15 June) at Stafford Crown Court after pleading guilty to 11 sexual offences in February at the same court.

He admitted to a sexual assault on a woman, two counts of taking an indecent photo/pseudo-photograph of a child, three counts of making an indecent photograph of a child, three counts of voyeurism and possession of extreme pornographic images (not relating to children).

Willetts was arrested in October 2018 by the force's Child Protection and Exploitation Team. His mobile phone, two computer hard drives, three external hard drives and a USB stick were seized and examined. During a further search officers located a covert recording device.

More than 200 of the images and videos were classed as category A, the most serious kind.

A Sexual Harm Prevention Order has been imposed on Willetts for 10 years. He will also be required to sign the Sex Offenders Register for life.

Detective Sergeant Chris Hood, of the force's Child Protection and Exploitation Team, said: "I would like to commend the bravery of the victims throughout this investigation.

"I would like to reassure anyone who has been through anything similar, we will investigate and prosecute those responsible."

If you think someone has, is making or is distributing indecent images, please call 101. If you believe a child is in immediate danger call 999 straight away. You can also report via: https://www.ceop.police.uk/safety-centre/
