Four men have been arrested and drugs, cash and weapons seized in a police operation in Hanley this morning (July 2).

Four men, aged between 25 and 47, were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of amphetamines and cannabis following warrants at six properties in the Portland Street area.

Drugs and scales were seized by officers along with a gas-powered handgun, a large knife and a substantial amount of cash.

The men, who are all from the Hanley area, are currently in custody.

The warrants were executed by Stoke North Neighbourhood Officers along with partners from Stoke Policing Team, Disruption Team, Tactical Support Team, Special Constabulary and the Integrated Offender Management Unit.

PC Kevin Cook, from Stoke North Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "As a result of listening to concerns from the community we have made four arrests and our enquiries will continue.

"We would like to thank the community as we are aware of anti-social behaviour that has occurred over the last few weeks and it is our intention to continue with Disruption and proactive led policing in the future. Stoke North Neighbourhood Officers are here to reassure the community and to reduce the use of drug activity and the harm it causes to others."

Anyone with any concerns should contact Staffordshire Police via 101 or social media or anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
