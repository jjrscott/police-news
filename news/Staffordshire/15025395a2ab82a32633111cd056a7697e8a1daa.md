Officers are appealing for information after a group of men smashed windows and doors in Tamworth.

Firearms officers were deployed at around 7pm on Thursday to reports of a group of up to eight young men in balaclavas, believed to be armed with machetes and meat cleavers, destroying property on Cambrian Glascote.

The suspects fled the scene on foot in the direction of Chapelon as officers arrived.

Area Commander, Chief Inspector Paul Talbot, said: "This was a frightening incident for local residents at a time when more people are at home due to the second national coronavirus lockdown.

"Colleagues from Staffordshire's CID South team are supporting with the investigation. We are reviewing CCTV footage and interviewing witnesses, but I would urge anyone in the community who has information to get in touch with police to help us with our inquiries."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 725 of 5 November, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
