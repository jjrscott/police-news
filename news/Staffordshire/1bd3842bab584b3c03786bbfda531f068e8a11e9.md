A 29-year-old man has been jailed for seven years and four months after pleading guilty to attempting to rape a woman in Stafford town centre.

Aron Lee Hadjiouannou, of no fixed address, was jailed at Stafford Crown Court (16 Dec) after pleading guilty to attempted rape and sexual assault at a hearing on 20 September.

The court heard Hadjiouannou had assaulted the woman near to the Tesco store in Newport Road, Stafford, early in the morning of Sunday 18 August.

Officers arrested him shortly afterwards following a search of the area.

Detective Constable Martin Ottey, of Staffordshire Police, said: "I commend the victim for her bravery in helping us to bring this case to court. We will always do whatever it takes to bring offenders to justice, while ensuring victims and their families are offered the support they need."

Anyone who has suffered sexual abuse, or suspects others may be subject to sexual abuse, is urged to contact Staffordshire Police on 101.
