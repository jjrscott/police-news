Detectives have named a woman who was found dead at a property in Burton on Tuesday (2 March).

Kelly Webber, aged 41, of Burton, was found at the property in Somerset Road. An investigation is underway and detectives are working to understand the circumstances around her death.

Kelly's family have requested privacy and do not wish to comment further.

The results of a post mortem yesterday were inconclusive and further tests will take place.

A man, aged 39, and a woman, aged 44, both from Burton, were arrested on suspicion of murder and have been bailed while enquiries continue.

We would kindly ask that people locally do not speculate as to the identity of those involved or the circumstances as we continue to investigate.

We will provide further updates. Anyone with information should contact us via social media or on 101 quoting reference 476 of 2 March.
