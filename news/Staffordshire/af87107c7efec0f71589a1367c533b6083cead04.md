Four men have been arrested on suspicion of drugs offences after officers stopped a car on the A500 in Stoke-on-Trent.

The men, aged 16, 19 and 24, all from Fenton, and a 40-year-old from Lincoln, were all arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply cocaine.

They were stopped near the junction with the A53 at around 5pm yesterday (9 September). They remain in custody.

The arrests were made as part of Operation Lightning, which aims to disrupt and deter criminals' use of the road network and reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured on the roads.
