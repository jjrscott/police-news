A 20-year-old man has been charged with attempted grievous bodily harm (GBH) and dangerous driving after a cyclist was hit by a car in Brewood.

The collision took place on Tinkers Lane at about 1.30pm on Sunday (8 Nov).

The male victim, aged 77, was not seriously injured, but suffered bruising after allegedly being struck by a black Fiat 500 and going into a hedgerow.

Tristan Chandler, of no fixed abode, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder on Wednesday but was later charged with GBH, dangerous driving, failing to stop and failing to report a road incident. His vehicle has also been seized.

He was remanded in police custody and is due to appear before magistrates in Cannock later today (12 Nov).

DCI David Wain said: "Our team have worked through the night to progress this investigation and this sends out a clear message with regards to our commitment to keep people safe in South Staffordshire."
