A serving Staffordshire Police officer has been convicted of corruption through abuse of his authority of the office of constable.

PC Jarrett Kinson, 36, a response officer based in Burton, admitted interactions and contact through social media with a member of the public between March and July 2018. The complaint did not involve a physical meeting outside of his duties as a police officer or a sexual relationship.

Kinson pleaded guilty at Birmingham Crown Court today (Wednesday 9 October 2019).

He was interviewed following an internal investigation by the force's Performance and Standards Unit.

He remains suspended from his role with Staffordshire Police and will face internal disciplinary proceedings.
​
Deputy Chief Constable, Nick Baker at Staffordshire Police, said: "Abuse of position by police officers or staff is never acceptable as it causes harm or distress to the very people we should be protecting and keeping safe.
​
Kinson has been bailed to appear at Birmingham Crown Court on 4 November.
