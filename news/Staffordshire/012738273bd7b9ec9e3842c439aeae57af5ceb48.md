A man's been charged after police stopped a car carrying what's believed to be hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of drugs on the M6.

Officers from the force's Major and Organised Crime Department seized a large amount of cannabis from a Peugeot Van travelling southbound near to junction 12 of the M6 shortly before 1pm on Monday 30 November.

27-year-old Kevin Irvine from Londonderry has been charged with being concerned in the supply of cannabis.

He remains in police custody ahead of an appearance at North Staffordshire Justice Centre this morning (Wednesday 2 December).
