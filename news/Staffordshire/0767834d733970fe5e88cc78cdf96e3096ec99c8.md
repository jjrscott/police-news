Police have put a dispersal order in place in Hanley city centre following an increase in anti-social behaviour.

The order, granted under section 34 of the Anti-social behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014, gives officers the power to disperse anyone for the purpose of or reducing the likelihood of members of the public in the locality being harassed, alarmed, distressed or the occurrence of crime and disorder.

The area falling under the order is Hanley city centre, inside the Potteries Way, A50, A5008, Century Street and A5006.

The order follows a number of incidents of anti-social behaviour and the arrest of a 41-year-old man for affray yesterday (22 Oct). He has been bailed not to enter Upper Market Square or Fountain Square.

High visibility patrols will be addressing these issues and telling groups to leave where necessary. Anyone failing to disperse could be arrested.

Chief Inspector Mark Barlow authorised the new order, which runs from 9.30am today (Oct 23) to midnight, and from 9am to midnight tomorrow.

He said: "We have had a number of incidents reported and we are working closely with our partners to resolve and clamp down on anti-social behaviour."
