We are appealing for information after an attempted armed robbery using a knife at a shop in Burton.

Two members of staff at Carats, on Station Street, were closing up after 5pm on Friday 4 December when two men have entered the shop and held a knife to the stomach of one of them.

The two men have pushed the staff around, smashed the Covid-19 protective screens in place and demanded they open the safe. But when the staff could not access it they fled the premises on foot towards High Street.

They are described as one white male and one black male wearing black scarves so only their eyes could be seen. One was possibly wearing a blue hoody and the other possibly a green jacket.

One of the Carats staff members was left with pain in their shoulder after being grabbed by one of the two men.

Officers are studying CCTV footage from other shops in the street in an attempt to identify the two men.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 469 of 4 December, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
