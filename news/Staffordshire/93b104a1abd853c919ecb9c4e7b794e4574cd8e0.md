Staffordshire Police Chief Constable Gareth Morgan has welcomed six new officers after they transferred from other forces around the country.

The officers, who are to join different departments throughout the force, gave their formal commitment to uphold the law and protect the people of Staffordshire in an attestation ceremony at police headquarters earlier today.

CC Morgan said: "The attestation is a reminder of that most important obligation the force has to the law, to public service and to do the right thing."

The force has welcomed about 40 transferees so far this year.

The latest recruits from Greater Manchester, Bedfordshire and Cheshire said they hoped their new roles in the force would give them a better work life balance and more opportunities to progress in their careers.

"It is a blending of people, of new perspectives that will benefit the force as a whole, especially during this time of change and uncertainty," CC Morgan added.

Magistrate Alan Jones, who conducted the ceremony, wished the officers luck in their new roles and pledged to support them as they carry out their new duties across the county.
