Riders of 'adapted bikes' are being warned they are putting themselves at risk of sustaining serious injuries - and also face having their vehicles seized.

Neighbourhood officers say they have received reports of youths putting small engines on to pedal bikes and riding them around the Stanfield area of Stoke-on-Trent.

PCSO Nick Warrilow, of Stoke-on-Trent North Neighbourhood Policing Team, says those using the bikes are putting themselves at risk of serious injury.

He said: "We have been made aware of these adapted bikes being ridden on public highways in Stanfield - which is an offence. Not only are they breaking the law but also putting themselves at risk of serious injury."

Signs have previously been installed in the area to warn riders of Section 59 legislation, which gives officers the power to seize vehicles being used in an anti-social manner.

PCSO Warrilow added: "We provide advice and warnings but also have the power to seize vehicles which are a causing issues in our communities."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
