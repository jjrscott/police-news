Two men from Birmingham have been charged with a burglary that took place in Lichfield on Monday (16 November).

Jason Lewis, aged 43, of no fixed address, and Rodney King, aged 42, of Watton Green, Castle Vale, are charged with burglary at a property in Birmingham Road.

They are charged with stealing an iPad, golf equipment, a shaver, a suitcase, and bank cards.

They will appear before magistrates in Newcastle-under-Lyme this morning.

Detectives are also appealing for information and assistance in finding a distinctive gold and cream Omega watch with personalised engraving. They believe this may also have been taken at the burglary.

Anyone with information is urged to contact Staffordshire Police on 101 or via social media quoting ref 400 of 16 November.
