Officers are appealing for witnesses after a fatal road traffic collision in Barton-under-Needwood last night (Wednesday 28 October).

It's following a report of a Silver Volkswagen Golf coming off the road by the A38 in Barton shortly before 10pm.

Sadly, an adult male was confirmed dead at the scene.

The road was closed as officers from the Staffordshire and West Midlands Serious Collision Investigation Unit investigated the circumstances surrounding the collision but it has since reopened.

Any witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage is asked to get in touch by either calling 101 quoting incident number 687 of 28 October or emailing the investigation team direct at ciu@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk.
