Officers are appealing for information after CCTV captured the theft of a catalytic convertor from a car parked in Burton.

On Saturday (27 March), a resident of Clays Lane in Branston called the police at about 7.40pm to report they had witnessed three men arrive in a dark coloured Renault Megane or Scenic.

The vehicle's owner heard noise outside their property and checked their CCTV to see the men acting suspiciously around their car.

Three men had gotten out of the Renault - one keeping lookout while the other two approached the resident's car. The two are both described as white and one was wearing a white coat and a cap and the other was said to be wearing dark clothing and a cap.

The offenders appeared to use a heavy duty vehicle jack and saw and cut the catalytic converter off the victim's vehicle. They then drove off in the Renault in the direction of Burton Road.

Anyone with any information or who saw or heard anything suspicious on the evening in question should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 702 of 27 March, or alternatively contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
