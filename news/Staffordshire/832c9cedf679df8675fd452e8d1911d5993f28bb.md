A Stafford man who was caught with a large sum of cash has been jailed for two years after admitting possessing drugs with intent to supply.

Morgan Bailey, aged 22, of Merrivale Road, Rising Brook, was jailed at Stafford Crown Court (6 March).

He also pleaded guilty to being concerned in the supply of cannabis and acquiring/using criminal property in December last year.

The court heard that Bailey was with another man, Steven Dawkins, when stopped by officers in Greengate Street in Stafford town centre at 3pm on 29 May 2018.

He was searched and officers seized around £1,500 in cash.

A search of Bailey's home address led to the discovery of a further £770 in cash and 64 grams of cannabis, as well as scales and bags.

When Dawkins was searched in the street, alongside Bailey, officers found 4.1 grams of monkey dust, a class B drug. Dawkins pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply the drug and was sentenced to 14 months on 2 January.

Sergeant Tom Fotherby, of Stafford Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "The team has been working very hard to target those intending to supply drugs in Stafford and secure convictions.

"We want to send out a clear message that we will not tolerate dealing and will bring offenders before the courts."
