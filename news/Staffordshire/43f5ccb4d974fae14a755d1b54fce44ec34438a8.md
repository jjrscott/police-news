Staffordshire Police is continuing to support Counter Terrorism Police colleagues in London and West Midlands with their investigations following the incidents over the weekend.

As part of their enquiries, officers carried out searches at two addresses in the Staffordshire and Stoke areas. Both of these searches are now complete and officers would like to thank the local community for their support and patience whilst these enquiries were carried out.

The force continues to carry out further enhanced neighbourhood patrols to reassure local communities.

Investigations by Counter Terrorism Command colleagues remain ongoing and anyone with information that they believe may assist with the ongoing investigation should contact detectives in confidence, on 0800 789 321 or alternatively, call Crimestoppers, which is completely anonymous on 0800 555 111.
