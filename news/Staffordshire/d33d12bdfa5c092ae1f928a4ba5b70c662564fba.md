Detectives are appealing for information after money was stolen from a householder in Burton by men posing as builders.

The incident happened at 11.30am yesterday morning (Oct 3) in Saxon Street, Burton.
Three men in a white Transit van with ladders on the top asked if the householder required work done on his gutters and brickwork.

After the men left the householder discovered a large amount of cash had been taken from an upstairs room.

The men are described as three white men, one in his 50s and the others younger. All of them wore orange hi-vis jackets and the male in his 50s spoke with an Irish accent.

It is believed the men may also be posing as bogus officials or gas workers in the Burton area, possibly in Napier Street the same morning.

Anyone with information on the incident is asked to contact Staffordshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 420 of 3 October 2019.
