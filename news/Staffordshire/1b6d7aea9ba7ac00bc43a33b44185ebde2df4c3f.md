Neighbourhood officers in Stafford have seized drugs, designer trainers, road bikes and thousands of pounds of cash in a series of raids.

The raids took place at addresses across Stafford in the last 48 hours as part of Staffordshire Police's Operation Disrupt. The ongoing operation targets criminality with warrants, searches and vehicle checks across the county.

Yesterday (22 Sept) officers executed a search warrant at an address in Edison Road, Coton Fields, and arrested two men, aged 47 and 23, on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class-A drugs. They have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Around £18,000 in cash was seized along with 64 boxes of Nike Air Max trainers, a quantity of cannabis and cutting agents.

A further search at an address in Eccleshall Road, Holmcroft, led to the seizure of cocaine, further cutting agents and weapons.

This morning (23 Sept) officers carried out a warrant at a property in Exeter Street, Silkmore, and arrested on a 42-year-old man on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of drugs.

Four Boardman bikes, golf clubs and drugs, believed to be monkey dust, were seized.

On September 10 officers charged Rayon Saunders with possession with intent to supply heroin and cocaine in Stafford and in possession of criminal property to the value of £6,100. Saunders has been remanded in custody.

Superintendent Tom Chisholm, Head of Neighbourhood Policing, said: "Operation Disrupt is already delivering great results with arrests made and drugs, cash and property confiscated.

"So far we've seen great work from officers in Moorlands, Stoke South and Stafford's neighbourhood policing teams. There will be activity right across the county."
