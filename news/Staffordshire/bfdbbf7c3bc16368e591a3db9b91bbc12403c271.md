Two men are recovering from head injuries after they were reportedly attacked by a large group of youths in Wolstanton in the early hours of Saturday morning.

The pair had been walking down High Street, near The Marsh, at around 2:30am when they were approached by a group of unknown males.

They were then hit over the head and robbed - neither received injuries that are believed to be life threatening.

Officers attended the scene and are carrying out local enquiries.

Detective Constable David Stubbs, of CID North, said: "We are appealing for witnesses and asking anyone with any information around this attack to get in touch.

"We have also been made aware of two further attacks that could be linked. One occurred at around 10pm on Friday 24 July near the shops on Bradwell Lane whilst the other took place around midnight near to the Esso Service Station on the A34. The Bradwell Lane incident has yet to be reported to police and we're appealing for anyone impacted to come forward."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 133 of 25 July, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
