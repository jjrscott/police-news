A 78-year-old man has been jailed for historic sexual offences involving a child.

Joseph Hopkins was an social worker in the 1990s when he took the child to a secluded location in his car before raping and sexually assaulting him.

He was charged with buggery and two counts of indecent assault on child after the now adult victim came forward to report him after an investigation was launched in 2015.

Hopkins, formerly of Lichfield, was sentenced to 11 years and six months behind bars at Stafford Crown Court on Wednesday (2 December) after a jury found him guilty of all charges after trial.

He has also been placed on the Sex Offenders' Register for life.

Sergeant Zoe Thompson, of the force's Rape and Serious Sexual Offences team, who led the investigation, said: "This has been a long and complex investigation resulting in an excellent outcome for the victim who can now try and re-build his life following years of suffering."

Anyone who has suffered sexual abuse, or suspects others may be subject to sexual abuse, is urged to contact Staffordshire Police.
