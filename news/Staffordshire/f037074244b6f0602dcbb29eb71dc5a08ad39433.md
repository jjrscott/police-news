Detectives are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Stoke-on-Trent.

Just before 3pm on Sunday (7 June) it was reported that two men travelling in dark-coloured Toyota approached an 18-year-old man as he crossed Hanley Road (near the Co-op) in Sneyd Green.

They made threats and injured him with a knife before stealing a designer cap.

He was taken to hospital by colleagues from West Midlands Ambulance Service and discharged the same evening.

Enquiries are on-going and any witnesses or anyone with information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter or call 101 quoting incident number 336 of 7 June. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
