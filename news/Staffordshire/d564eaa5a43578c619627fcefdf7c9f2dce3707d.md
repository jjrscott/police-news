Officers have been visiting various rural locations this week to provide a visible presence and listen to the concerns of the communities.

Inspector Mark Joynson, of Staffordshire Police's Rural and Wildlife Crime Team, said: "Our officers are always keen to liaise with the rural communities and find out just what matters to them and what we can do to support them."

In addition officers are also reminding people to be respectful when walking through rural areas.

Inspector Joynson said: "We have previously reminded dog owners of their responsibility of making sure their pet is on a lead when around livestock. We would also ask walkers to be respectful of the area they are passing through and to take simple measures like leaving gates as they find them and not blocking entrances with vehicles."
