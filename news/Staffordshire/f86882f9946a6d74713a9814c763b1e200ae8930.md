Updated News Post

Officers from Staffordshire Police have called off the search for missing person Deborah Brown, who was last seen in Dosthill, Tamworth, on Saturday (25 January).

Sadly, the body of a woman, believed to be 47-year-old Deborah, was found this afternoon (Thursday 30 January) during a search of Cliff Lakes in Tamworth.

Her family have been informed and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.

We would like to thank colleagues, partner agencies and the public for their assistance and support during the search.

Formal identification will take place in due course. Detectives do not believe there are any suspicious circumstances and a report will be prepared for HM Coroner.
