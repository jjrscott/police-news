Police are appealing for witnesses after two men are reported to have threatened a woman with a machete at a pub in Tamworth.

Officers were called to The Centurion Pub in Centurion Park just before 11pm on Boxing Day last year to reports two men - described as in their early 20s and wearing scarves over their faces - had broken into the premises using crowbars.

The pair then broke into the office near to the pub's residential area before forcing the woman to empty the safe. They made their escape after stealing the contents.

Anyone with any information should message DC Gareth Morris at gareth.morris@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk, Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 579 of 26 December, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
