Staffordshire Police Chief Constable, Gareth Morgan, said: "We all know that this year has been extraordinarily challenging for all of us and I want to pay tribute to the public for their patience and determination to do the right thing and to say thank you to all my colleagues in Staffordshire Police for their hard work and commitment throughout the year."

This commitment will continue during Christmas and the New Year as the county remains under tight restrictions over the festive period and into 2021. There are signs of hope with the Covid vaccination programme underway but this is in the very early stages and now we have a new strain of the virus to contend with which seems to spread more quickly.

"This means the best gift people can give this Christmas is to make every effort to protect family and friends and stop the spread of the disease by abiding strictly to the current Tier 3 restrictions. If we don't do this it is inevitable that we will follow many other areas across the country and become a Tier 4 area.

"We know the majority of people in Staffordshire have done their best to follow the regulations in order to reduce the spread of Covid-19, for which we are hugely grateful. But we must now redouble our efforts and do everything we can to protect each other by following the rules this Christmas, however difficult this may be.

"I have been clear that robust enforcement will be used with the minority of people who flout the regulations and officers have been stepping up patrols and working closely with partners to ensure a high level of adherence to the restrictions. The quicker we can control the virus we can return to a more normal way of life and I know that is something we all want to see in 2021."
