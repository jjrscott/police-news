Police across Cannock and Rugeley are asking people who visit Cannock Chase for their exercise to make sure they keep to their family groups and not congregate with other walkers and cyclists, in order to stop the spread of Covid-19 and help to save lives.

The warning follows reports of a very busy weekend across the popular park area, with people choosing to take advantage of the hot weather to visit areas such as Marquis Drive and Birches Valley.

Neighbourhood policing teams have patrolled across the famous beauty spots and say that although the majority of people have been with their own family groups and socially distancing while walking, there have been some reports of groups of cyclists riding together and excessive numbers of vehicles parking on grass verges in the area, which can be a hazard to other road users.

Chief Inspector Becky Hyde, area commander for Cannock Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "The vast majority of people are being really supportive and following social distancing rules and I am thankful to them however there have been some reports where people appear to be ignoring the rules and being inconsiderate to others.

"Although our team haven't come across any groups specifically, we have had reports of larger groups of cyclists meeting up on areas of Cannock Chase and then cycling together, particularly over the weekend. This obviously is not acceptable or in the spirit of what constitutes exercising locally. Enforcement is an option to address anyone who is found flouting the legislation".

"I understand that people want to exercise and walk on the Chase, it's a beautiful place. Obviously we would encourage people to exercise at or near home wherever possible, however if people choose to travel a short distance they need to remember the rules and be sensible also thinking about how their actions impact on others"

"We all recognise that this is a difficult time but it is truly a community effort and each one of us has a vital part to play in preventing the spread of Covid-19."

CI Hyde added that police officers and PCSOs will continue to patrol areas of the Chase on foot and on cycles and also in vehicles over the coming days and weeks.
