Torches which can detect faint traces at crime scenes have been unveiled as the latest addition to Staffordshire Police's crime-fighting technology.

Two sets of the specialist torches - to be used in the north and the south of the county - have been purchased to allow forensics officers to inspect crime scenes and detect faint traces of fluids including semen, sweat, blood and other traces.

They also allow for detection of various fibres and gunshot residue. There are goggles to assist the user and filters for cameras.

The Staffordshire Forensics Partnership, a collaboration between Staffordshire University, the Staffordshire Commissioner and Staffordshire Police, worked with supplier Coppertree in testing and trialling the torches which will be used for training and in the field.

Martyn Hordern, forensics coordinator, Staffordshire Forensics Partnership, said: "We're delighted to add to our forensic capability and improve our detection at crimes scenes, as well as assisting students in their training and development."
