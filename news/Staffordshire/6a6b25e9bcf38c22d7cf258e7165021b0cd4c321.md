Specialist investigators are appealing for information or dashcam footage following a serious collision near Stafford on Friday afternoon (20 December).

Officers were called to a serious road traffic collision at around 3:25pm on the B5066 Sandon Road, near to the junction with Hopton Lane.

The collision involved a black Renault Clio being driven by a 30-year-old man from West Bromwich and a grey Peugeot 2008 being driven by an 80-year-old woman from Stafford.

The man was taken to hospital by air ambulance and remains there in a critical condition. The woman received hospital treatment for minor injuries and has since been released.

Officers from the Staffordshire and West Midlands Serious Collision Investigation Unit are appealing for any witnesses to the collision or anyone who has seen either vehicle before the collision. It is believed the Renault was travelling from the Sandon direction and the Peugeot had come from the Stafford direction.

Any witnesses are asked to call 101 or anyone with dashcam footage should email ciu@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk quoting incident number 524 of 20 December.
