Officers are appealing for witnesses after reports of a stabbing in Cannock.

We were called to the Orbital Retail Centre shortly before 4pm on Monday 14 September to reports of a 47-year-old man being stabbed following an altercation. He was taken to hospital with serious injuries to his hand.

A 46-year-old man, from Birmingham, was arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He's since been granted conditional police bail.

Detective Constable Toni Sunderland, from CID South, said: "Our investigation is still in its early stages and we're still eager to speak to anyone who may have witnessed what happened on Monday afternoon.

"We're in the process of carrying our local enquiries but if anyone has any CCTV or dash-cam footage of the incident then we'd invite them to get in touch."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 496 of 14 September, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
