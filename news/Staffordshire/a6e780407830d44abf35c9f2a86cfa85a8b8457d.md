A man has been arrested in Shelton this morning (19 August) on suspicion of a modern slavery offence, conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and perverting the course of justice.

The 28-year-old man, from Stoke-on-Trent, remains in custody.

Detective Chief Inspector Simon Caton, of CID North, said: "We would like to reassure the public that the increased police activity in Shelton is part of a planned operation to target criminal exploitation as part of a wider initiative with our partners."
