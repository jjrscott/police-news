Officers are investigating a non-stop collision where a dog was killed near Leek.

The incident happened at around 12.20am on Sunday 22 September when the owner was walking the dog with two colleagues from the Greyhound Inn back to a camp site at the Manifold Primary school in Warslow. A white BMW struck the dog and it sadly died at the scene. The car failed to stop and then sped away towards the A53.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who may have any information relating to the incident or who may have seen a white BMW with damage to its front end.
