Detectives are appealing for any information or witnesses that may assist with an investigation into an incident that resulted in an injured woman requiring medical attention.

Officers were called to Brampton Park in Newcastle-under-Lyme at around 1am this morning (29 November).

A woman is now receiving medical support and detectives are working to establish the circumstances of the incident. To assist with gathering evidence, detectives have closed off a part of Brampton Sidings. It is hoped this cordon will be lifted very soon.

Anyone who may have witnessed any suspicious behaviour in the area around that time should call 101 quoting incident number 24 of 29 November. Alternatively, for guaranteed anonymity, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
