A man from Stoke-on-Trent has been jailed for 13 years after being found guilty of rape, sexual assault and attempted kidnap.

Following a week-long trial at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court earlier this month,
Naim Mohammed Aziz, 40, of Hillchurch Street, Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, was sentenced yesterday (Tuesday 22 December).

He was found guilty of rape, two counts of sexual assault, attempted kidnap, administering a substance with intent, causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent and committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence.

Aziz was arrested on 9 April 2019 following incidents in April 2018 and February and March 2019.

In April 2018, he raped and sexually assaulted a 17-year-old girl in the Northwood area of Stoke-on-Trent.

In March 2019, an 18-year-old woman was walking in Hanley when Aziz approached her from behind and put his arms around her. She pushed him away and walked off. He then pulled up behind her in a car, got out and put his hand over her mouth and dragged her towards the car. She managed to get free and ran away from him.

Detective Sergeant Michael George, of CID North, said: "The vicitms were subjected to ordeals from a man whose actions left both victims traumatised.
"I would like to thank the victims, whose bravery and courage in supporting our investigation and the court case has been instrumental."
