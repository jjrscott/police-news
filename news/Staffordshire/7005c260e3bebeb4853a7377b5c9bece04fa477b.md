A 76-year-old man has been jailed for 15 years for non-recent sexual offences committed against two young children in Stoke-on-Trent.

David Jepson, of Tasman Square, Hanley, was sentenced at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court today (29 January) after being found guilty of four counts of cause/incite a child to engage in sexual activity and four counts of sexual assault at the same court on 28 January.

Detective Constable Annie Blairs, of CID, said: "The victims have been brave in speaking out about these offences.

"These were despicable offences committed against young, vulnerable children. We will always do whatever it takes to bring offenders to justice, while ensuring victims and their families are offered the support they need."

Anyone who has suffered sexual abuse, or suspects others may be subject to sexual abuse, is urged to contact Staffordshire Police on 101.
