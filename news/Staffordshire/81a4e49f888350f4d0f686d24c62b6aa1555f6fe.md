A 37-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of burglary following an attempted break in Bucknall, Stoke-on-Trent.

Police were called to Asda on Werrington Road at 11.45pm yesterday (Wednesday) after the security alarm activated.

Two men attempted to lift the steel shutters to the store in order to gain entry. The pair ran in the direction of Bellbrook Lane and crossed the fields where they were pursued by officers. One suspect was detained by police at the scene.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 810 of 20/11, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
