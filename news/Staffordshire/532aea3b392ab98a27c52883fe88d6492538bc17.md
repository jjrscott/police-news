We are appealing for witnesses to an incident where a teenage girl was asked to get into a man's car after he pulled up alongside her in Stoke-on-Trent yesterday (Thursday 19 November).

The teenager was walking along Turnhurst Road towards Packmoor at about 3.50pm when a dark blue car, believed to be a Volkswagen Golf, pulled up alongside her.

A male driver asked her to get in the back of the vehicle and he would give her a lift home, but when she refused he drove off towards Mellor Street.

He is described as white, aged in his 30s, with dark brown short hair, and was wearing a disposable blue facemask.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 471 of 19 November, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
