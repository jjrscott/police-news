Officers from Staffordshire Police arrested two men following warrants in Shelton, Stoke-on-Trent, on Friday afternoon (22 November).

A large amount of cash, drugs paraphernalia, mobile phones and a quantity of drugs - believed to be heroin and crack cocaine - were all seized from two addresses on Havelock Place and Sun Street.

Haroon Hussain, aged 26, of Havelock Place, was arrested and has since been charged with two counts of possession of controlled drugs with intent to supply Class A, and acquiring criminal property.

He was remanded in custody, and appeared at North Staffordshire Justice Centre in Newcastle-under-Lyme today (25 November).

A 22-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs, and has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.
