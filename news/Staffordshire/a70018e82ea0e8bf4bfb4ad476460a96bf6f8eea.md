We are currently in attendance in the Roman Way area of Tamworth after a woman's body was discovered just after 9pm this evening (Sept 19).

An area has been cordoned off as an investigation begins to understand the circumstances around her death.

A 19-year-old man has been arrested in connection with her death and is in custody.

We would kindly ask people not to speculate at this time as our enquiries continue. We will provide further updates as soon as we are able to do so.
