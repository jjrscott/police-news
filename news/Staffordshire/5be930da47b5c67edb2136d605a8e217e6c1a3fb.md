Detectives are appealing for information after a serious sexual assault in Barlaston on Friday (5 June).

Officers attended an area off Wedgwood Drive in Barlaston at around 5pm following a report a woman had been sexually assaulted.

Detective Sergeant Zoe Thompson, of CID South, said a man in his 20s from the local area had been arrested in connection with the incident.

"We're appealing for information from anyone who may have been in the area of Wedgwood Drive, Ivyhouse Drive and Barlaston Park at the time.

"It's believed that a witness, an elderly man, described as having grey hair and wearing a green jacket walking a dog, spoke to the victim sometime before the sexual assault and we'd urge him to get in touch."

Anyone with information is urged to contact Staffordshire Police via social media or 101, referring to incident 437 of 5 June.
