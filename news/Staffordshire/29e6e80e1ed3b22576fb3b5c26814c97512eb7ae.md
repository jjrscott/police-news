Officers moved swiftly when a property in Stoke-on-Trent was found to be housing a cannabis grow yesterday (Monday 8 March).

We received a call from somebody managing a property on St John Street in Hanley at about 3pm asking for our assistance.

They had attended the property to find somebody had broken in and changed the locks. After gaining entry with the help of a locksmith they found a large cannabis growing operation on the upper floor. There was also food still cooking on the cooker, indicating somebody had recently been in the property.

Western Power were also called to attend after it was found the electricity supply had been bypassed.

The scene was secured by officers overnight into today (Tuesday 9 March) and more than 50 plants and paraphernalia used in the cultivation of cannabis were seized.

The property was closed off and the keys will be returned to the owner. Enquiries are continuing.
