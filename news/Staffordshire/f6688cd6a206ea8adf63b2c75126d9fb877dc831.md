A 43-year-old man has been charged with a number of burglary offences in North Staffordshire.

James Casey, of no fixed address, is accused of three residential burglaries in Newcastle, Meir and Lightwood. In relation to the incidents in Meir and Lightwood, he is also charged with two offences of theft of a motor vehicle after two cars were taken during the incidents.

He was arrested and remanded in prison for other offences with these eight charges being secured this week. He is expected to appear at North Staffordshire Justice Centre next month.
