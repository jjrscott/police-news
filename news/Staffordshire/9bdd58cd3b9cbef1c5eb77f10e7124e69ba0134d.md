Police are appealing for information after a reported hate crime incident in Burton.

Officers received a number of reports of a gang of masked youths repeatedly throwing fireworks into the front of a takeaway on Uxbridge Street on the evening of Sunday 8 November.

No one is believed to have been hurt but an investigation is now underway into finding those involved.

Chief Inspector Clair Langley from the East Staffordshire Neighbourhood Policing Team said: "We take incidents of hate crime very seriously and we're interested in speaking to anyone who might have been in the area at the time.

"Every effort will be made to identify the individuals responsible"

"We are aware of a video being circulated on social media and we will look to take the necessary measures against those involved.

"We continue to work with local partners to ensure the victim is supported."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number660 of 8 November, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
