A man has been jailed for six years after pleading guilty to sexual offences involving a child.

Carl Plimmer, 25, of Norman Road, Penkridge, was sentenced today (Friday 7 February) at Stafford Crown Court after pleading guilty to eight sexual offences.

He was arrested at his home in September 2018 after a 14-year-old girl from outside of Staffordshire reported that she was being groomed online by Plimmer. He had asked her to send indecent images and said he wanted to meet her. Detectives from the force's Child Protection and Exploitation Team (CPET) began an investigation and seized Plimmer's electronic devices.

Plimmer pleaded guilty to all counts at a previous hearing in November. He admitted to three counts of making indecent photographs/pseudo-photographs of a child, cause/incite the sexual exploitation of a child aged 13 to 17, two counts of causing/incite a girl aged 13 to 17 to engage in sexual activity, causing a child aged 13 to 15 to watch/look at an image of sexual activity and engaging in sexual communication with a child.

DC Sarah Wilkinson, from CPET said: "I hope the conviction of Plimmer will offer some comfort to the victim who was manipulated.

"The victim has shown great courage throughout the investigation.

"I hope this conviction will provide reassurance to other victims of sexual offences, giving them the confidence to report, and the confidence that they will be believed and that police will do everything to bring offenders to justice."
