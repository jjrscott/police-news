Officers have made a second arrest in connection with a reported hate crime incident at a takeaway in Burton

An 18-year-old man from Stapenhill, Burton was arrested on suspicion of affray and criminal damage after we received a number of reports of a gang of masked youths repeatedly throwing fireworks at a business on Uxbridge Street on the evening of Sunday November.

He has since been released on conditional police bail.

It follows the arrest of a 19-year-old man from Burton last week in connection with the incident.

Chief Inspector Clair Langley from the East Staffordshire Neighbourhood Policing Team said: "Members of the public should feel reassured that we are working tirelessly to identify and apprehend the individuals responsible.

"We are pleased to have secured two arrests and we believe our investigation is leading us to securing more.

"A mobile police van will also be on Uxbridge Street this week to provide some community reassurance."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number660 of 8 November, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
