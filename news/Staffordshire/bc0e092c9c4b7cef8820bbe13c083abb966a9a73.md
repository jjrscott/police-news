Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward as an investigation continues into the death of a man in Tamworth.

31-year-old Joe Olner, of Eringden, Tamworth, died in hospital a short time after officers were called to a incident in Crossfell shortly before 5:30am on Tuesday 19 January.

Detective Inspector Alan Lyford from Staffordshire Police said: "Joe's sad death is currently being treated as unexplained following an inconclusive post-mortem.

"Further work to establish the circumstances around the death are ongoing and we are particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have been in the Eringden or Crossfell area of Tamworth between 9pm on Monday 18 January and 5:30am on Tuesday 19 January.

"We have started carrying out assessment of local CCTV but we ask that anyone with footage of the area get in touch - if we've not already spoken to you."

Joe's family is being supported by specially trained officers and have asked for their privacy to be respected.
