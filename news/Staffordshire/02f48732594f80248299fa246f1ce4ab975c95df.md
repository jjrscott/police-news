Detectives are appealing for witnesses following an aggravated burglary in Stoke-on-Trent last night (10 February).

Staffordshire Police received a report of a break-in at a home on May Place, Fenton, at around 10.35pm. It is believed three men wearing hoods and dark clothing, entered the property and assaulted a teenager.

They took a number of items, including a watch and a mobile phone, and caused considerable damage inside the address.

The men, armed with knives, reportedly left the scene in two white vehicles.

A 15-year-old boy living at the home suffered facial injuries and was taken to hospital.

Anyone who has CCTV facing outwards in that area, anyone with information about the incident is asked to contact 101, quoting incident number 841 of 10 Feb.

Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers for guaranteed anonymity on 0800 555 111.
