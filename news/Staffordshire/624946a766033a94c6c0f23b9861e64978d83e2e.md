Following information from members of the local community, two cannabis factories have been discovered in Newcastle-Under-Lyme.

Officers found a significant number of cannabis plants and equipment used to cultivate the plants in the properties in Whitmore on Thursday afternoon (17 October).

The electricity supply had also been diverted to power the equipment, but the properties have since been made safe.

Enquires are continuing to establish who is responsible for the grow.

Chief Inspector Clair Langley, commander for Newcastle neighbourhood policing team, said: "A considerable number of cannabis plants have now been taken off the streets and this criminality has been disrupted.

"We are committed to tackling drug crime in our area and will take appropriate action against those who engage in such activity."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact 101, quoting incident number 448 of 15 October.
