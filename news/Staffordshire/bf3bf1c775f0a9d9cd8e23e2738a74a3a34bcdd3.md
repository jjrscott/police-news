Police are warning people to be on their guard against suspicious callers at the door following a bogus official incident in Cannock.

The advice comes after a bogus builder struck at the home of a man in Norton Canes at approximately 12.30pm this afternoon (2 October).

A man claimed he was working on a building site and that he needed to dig up the grass to clear a water blockage. He entered the property and has stolen a set of keys (car and house).

He is described as white, in his early 20s and 6ft 2ins tall. He was wearing a black baseball cap and a black jacket.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone with information, or who saw anyone suspicious and/or vehicles in the area prior to the incident, particularly where men knock on the door unexpectedly.

Anyone with information on the incident is asked to contact Staffordshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 328 of 2 October 2019.
