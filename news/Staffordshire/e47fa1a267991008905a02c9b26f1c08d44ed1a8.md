Officers are hoping to reunite a number of suspected stolen tools along with an off-road motorbike with their owners.

The items were recovered from two addresses in Stoke-on-Trent earlier this month during an operation where a number of off-road bikes were also seized.

Now officers involved in the operation are hoping to reunite the owners of items still unclaimed which they believe were stolen.

Various Makita-branded power tools including drills, circular saws and angle grinders are yet to be claimed along with a Kawasaki off-road bike.

PC Scott Turner, of Stoke-on-Trent South Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "These are valuable items and we would like to see them back with their owners."

Anyone who recognizes some of the items should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 82 of February 5, or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
