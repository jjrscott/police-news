Two volunteers from the Special Constabulary - including one working only his second shift - have reunited an education centre with their stolen bikes.

Special Sergeant Sam Cuzick was training newbie Special Constable Jack Tomkins on Monday (4 May) when they disturbed suspects who were in the middle of stealing bikes from the Chasewater Outdoor Education Centre just before 10pm.

A total of 11 were taken but three were discovered by the Specials on Poole Lane and another one in a canal opposite the reservoir.

Tony Athersmith, Chief Officer of Specials, said: "Even though the suspects made off from us, these two Specials prevented anything else being stolen and immediately recovered some of the bikes.

"Jack was on his second shift with Staffordshire Police and he's already making a difference to the community. This sort of work just shows how invaluable our Specials are - especially during this unprecedented time."

The remaining seven bikes are still missing and have distinguishable stickers that read 'Chasewater Education Centre' on them. Anyone that may have seen the bikes should contact us on Facebook or Twitter or call 101 quoting incident number 761 of 4 May.
