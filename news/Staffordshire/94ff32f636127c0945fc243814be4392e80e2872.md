A Stafford woman who crawled past a window in an attempt to avoid CCTV has been jailed for burglary.

The burglary took place at around 9pm on 15 June at a conference centre in Norton Bridge, near Stafford.

Lisa Vandriel was caught peering into an office at the centre and challenged. She left on foot, but when CCTV was inspected Vandriel could be seen approaching the building before crawling along an outer wall of the house beneath a bay window.

She entered via an insecure door and was captured on CCTV going through cash tins and drawers in an office. She wiped down items and then shut down the CCTV system so it stopped recording.

Vandriel, aged 41, of Moorfields, Stafford, was later identified by police officers and sentenced to 36 weeks' imprisonment after pleading guilty to the burglary.

She was jailed on 27 October at Stafford Crown Court.
