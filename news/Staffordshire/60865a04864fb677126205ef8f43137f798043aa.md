Detective Inspector Zoe Kelsall, who is leading the investigation, said formal identification was yet to take place but she believed it was Lucy Wright, 40, who was reported missing on 5 September.

"I have spoken to Lucy's family who are being supported by specially-trained officers at this difficult time and would kindly ask that their privacy is respected."

"The investigation is ongoing and anyone who may have seen Lucy or has information which will assist us in understanding the circumstances around her death should call 101 referring to incident 184 of 11 September.

The matter is being referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) due to previous police contact.
