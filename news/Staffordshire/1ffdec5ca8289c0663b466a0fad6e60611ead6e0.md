Detectives have launched an investigation into four burglaries which all took place on the same day in the Staffordshire Moorlands.

Properties in Draycott, Cheadle, and Checkley, were targeted between 4.30pm and 6.30pm on Wednesday, December 2. During the burglaries jewellery and clothes were taken after untidy searches were carried out. A silver saloon was seen in the area.

Now anyone with information over the incidents is being urged to come forward as Staffordshire Police continues to investigate the four incidents.

Two properties on Stuart Avenue in Draycott were targeted while burglaries also took place on Stokesay Drive in Cheadle and Badgers Hollow, Checkley. During each incident access was gained through the properties' rear doors.

Officers from the Staffordshire Moorlands Neighbourhood Policing Team will be patrolling the area.

Detective Inspector Scott McGrath, of CID North, said: "These sorts of offences are rare in the Staffordshire Moorlands but we would urge residents to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity. We are keen to hear from anyone living close to the addresses targeted who may have seen anything unusual that day to get in touch."

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
