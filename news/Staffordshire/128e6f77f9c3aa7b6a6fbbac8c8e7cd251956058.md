A man who tried to make off from officers by running through a pig sty, swimming through a canal and hiding in a wheelie bin has been arrested thanks to the quick feet of a police dog and cops.

Officers were called to a report of a suspicious vehicle at around 6.14am yesterday (3 May) at Muckley Corner service station on Walsall Road in Lichfield.

Police arrived at the scene but the vehicle made off, driving the wrong way round the Muckley Corner island and colliding with a road sign before getting out and heading towards the Brownhills island on the A5 on foot.

Officers and police dog Kaylaigh trudged through a farmer's pig sty and across fields before the man swam through a canal to get to the other side.

PD Kaylaigh and officers then discovered a man in a brown wheelie bin on Great Charles Street in Brownhills just after 8am.

A 25-year-old man from Walsall was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, failing to stop, leaving the scene of a road traffic collision, no insurance and drug driving.

He has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.
