A man found guilty of raping and sexually assaulting a child has been jailed for 18 years.

Brian Martin Moynihan, 66, of Chapel Street, Silverdale, was jailed today (Tuesday 9 March) at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court after being found guilty of 12 counts of rape and two counts of sexual assault.

The victim reported the rapes and sexual assaults to Staffordshire Police and an investigation was launched. The offences took place in the 1990s in Staffordshire.

Moynihan was also placed on the Sex Offenders Register for life.

Detective Inspector Zoe Kelsall, of the force's Rape and Serious Sexual Offences team, said: "Throughout the investigation and trial, Moynihan's victim displayed tremendous courage by reliving their experiences and their evidence left the jury with no doubt as to his guilt.

"I am pleased with the sentence that has been imposed.

"While our investigation has ended, we know their journey is really just beginning.

"I also hope that their courage to come forward encourages others who have been victims of non-recent rape or sexual assault to do the same. We will support them and do whatever we can to bring offenders to justice."

Anyone who has suffered sexual abuse, or suspects others may be subject to sexual abuse, is urged to contact Staffordshire Police on 101.

Alternatively, the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
