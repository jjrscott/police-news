Police are urging residents, particularly the elderly and vulnerable, to be on their guard following reports of rogue traders across the south of the county.

In recent days, traders have approached residents at their homes in Cannock, Lichfield and Rugeley offering tree surgery and over-charging.

Officers would like to remind the public to never allow any unsolicited visitors into their home, or agree to works being completed by door step traders.

If you require work to be done investigate it yourself, by phoning at least three companies and asking for like for like quotes.

Please warn elderly and vulnerable neighbours to follow the STOP, CHAIN, CHECK rule when people call at the door.
STOP - If you are not expecting anybody and they don't have an appointment, don't let them in.
CHAIN- Use your door chain or bar before opening the door
CHECK - Ask to see ID and double check this.

Local residents are encouraged to contact the police immediately if they have any suspicions about doorstep callers.
