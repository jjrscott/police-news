A 24-year-old man, who was serious injured in an incident in Chesterton in October, has sadly passed away in hospital.

Jake Taylor's family are being supported by specially-trained officers. Jake, of Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, passed away on November 13.

His family said: "We are all broken and hurting about the death of our son and we would like to ask that our privacy is respected at this really difficult time."

Police were called at 11pm on Saturday 31 October to two incidents in the Chesterton area - a disturbance involving groups carrying weapons on Palatine Drive and a non-stop collision on Loomer Road.

Detective Chief Inspector Jason Everett, of the force's Major Investigation Department, said: "We are appealing for anyone who has further information about this incident or may have witnessed it to come forward and assist our investigation.

"Sadly, Jake's family are now having to come to terms with his death."

Dean Condliffe, 25, of no fixed address, was charged with Section 18 assault (grievous bodily harm with intent) and causing serious injury by dangerous driving. He remains in custody and will be re-interviewed by officers.
