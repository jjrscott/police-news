A man in his sixties has been jailed for seven years after being caught with drugs he intended to supply, during a police operation in Tamworth.

Maurice Speid was arrested when his car was stopped in Masefield Drive, Tamworth, in the early hours of 7 May, and officers found heroin and cocaine.

Staffordshire Police was running an operation at the time targeting those coming into the county to deal drugs.

Speid, 67, of no fixed address, who was bringing in class-A drugs from Birmingham, was found guilty of possession with intent to supply cocaine and heroin, and possession of cannabis in a trial at Stafford Crown Court.

He was jailed for seven years for the offences on 8 November at Stafford.

The drugs had a total estimated street value of Â£4,000.

Chief Inspector Ashley Farrington, of Staffordshire Police, said: "I hope this result sends out a clear message we will not tolerate those who think they can come into Staffordshire and deal drugs.

"This was an intelligence-led operation which has led to a lengthy sentence for Speid."
