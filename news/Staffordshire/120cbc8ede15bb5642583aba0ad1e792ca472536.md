A 21-year-old man who hid drugs in a shed in Stafford has been jailed for seven years.

Aiden Vella was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years at Stafford Crown Court after pleading guilty to multiple counts of possessing crack cocaine and heroin with intent to supply.

The court heard that officers attended a block of flats in Hawksmoor Road, Stafford on 16 December last year and gained access to a shed where they seized a bag containing wraps.

Vella was arrested as he came down the stairs at the flats. When searched he had a key to the sheds.

Following examination the drugs were found to be heroin and cocaine.

The court heard that Vella was seen supplying drugs in Holmcroft Road, Stafford, on 15 May. Officers searched him and found two large wraps hidden in his waistband. The drugs were found to be heroin and crack cocaine.

In an earlier offence on 13 June 2018 officers went to find property at an address in New Street, Stafford, and seized crack cocaine and heroin from Vella.

Vella, of Young Avenue, Stafford, was sentenced on Tuesday (15 October).

The drugs seized in December 2018 were found to have an estimated street value of Â£1160.

Sergeant Tom Fotherby, of Stafford Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We're working hard to tackle those who are dealing drugs in Stafford and will continue to bring them before the courts.
