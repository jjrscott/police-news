Officers are appealing for witnesses following the death of a man who fell from a bridge in Stoke-on-Trent this morning (02 October).

A report of a road traffic collision on the A50 near Longton was received by police at 9am.

Sadly, an adult male was confirmed dead at the scene.

The road is currently closed in both directions as officers from the Staffordshire and West Midlands Serious Collision Investigation Unit investigate the circumstances surrounding the collision.

Any witnesses or anyone with relevant dashcam footage is asked to get in touch by either calling 101 quoting incident number 136 of 2 October or emailing the investigation team direct at ciu@staffordshire.pnn.police.uk.
