We are appealing for information over an incident where a man was assaulted and had an Audi RS7 and Rolex watch stolen from Fradley Skatepark.

The victim was in their car in the car park at the skatepark off Church Lane, Fradley, at about 11.50pm on Friday 13 November when they were attacked by a group of about five males wearing balaclavas, gloves and tracksuits who assaulted the victim and kicked them in the head. They sustained facial injuries during the attack.

They made off down Hay End Lane - believed to be in the direction of Alrewas - with the victim's Audi RS7, which has since been recovered, and a gold Rolex watch they were wearing.

The attached image of the Rolex watch is being distributed in an attempt to recover it.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 869 of 13 November, call 101 asking to speak to DC Jason Hughes of Lichfield CID or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
