Two men have been jailed after thousands of pounds worth of Class A drugs were found in a property in Tamworth

25-year-old Connor Chapman of Halford Street, Tamworth and 25-year-old Dale Wiseman of Elizabeth Street, Tamworth were last week sentenced to 30 months each behind bars after pleading guilty to possession with intent to supply Class A drugs.

The pair were detained in November 2018 after officers executed a search warrant under the Misuse of Drugs Act at a property on Ivatt, Tamworth.
Â£3,800 worth of drugs, including crack, cocaine, heroin and cannabis, were seized alongside other drug paraphernalia and mobile phones.

DI Tim Boulton from the force Major and Organised Crime Unit said: "These sentencings are further proof of the great work our officers are doing in combatting those intent on circulating drugs around our communities.

"My message to those who continue to bring drugs onto our streets is simple - we will continue to stamp out what you're doing and, if found guilty, you will be prosecuted."
