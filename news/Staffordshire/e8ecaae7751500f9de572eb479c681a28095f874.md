We were alerted to the discovery of a woman's body in woodland near to Roman Way, Tamworth, at 9pm last night (Sept 19).

Whilst formal identification is yet to take place we now believe the woman to be Keeley Bunker, aged 20, of Tamworth.

Her death is unexplained at this time and a Home Office post mortem is due to take place tomorrow.

We would politely request that people refrain from speculating as to the circumstances of Keeley's death to avoid causing further distress for her family who are being supported by specially-trained officers.

We have cordoned off a number of areas for forensic examination as the investigation continues.

A 19-year-old man from Tamworth who was arrested on suspicion of murder last night remains in custody.

There will be an increased police presence as our investigation continues.
