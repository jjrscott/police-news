Detectives have arrested five men in connection with two suspicious fires in Staffordshire.

Officers executed warrants at four addresses in the West Midlands this morning as part of an investigation into two fires last month.

A quantity of cocaine, four vehicles, including a car which was allegedly stolen during a burglary in the West Midlands in January, and a number of weapons, were seized.

The fires, at Clayton Convenience Stores in Newcastle and Angelo's Chippy in Burton, happened on Sunday 26 April.

All five men were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life. A 32-year-old, 39-year-old and a 44-year-old, from Wolverhampton, a 32-year-old, from Birmingham, and a 44-year-old man, from Walsall, have been released on bail pending further enquiries.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 717 of 26 April, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
