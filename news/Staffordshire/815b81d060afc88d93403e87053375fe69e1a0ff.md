Officers investigating continued catalytic convertor thefts across the county today (Tuesday 9 March) arrested a Stoke-on-Trent man in connection with one incident.

The 29-year-old was arrested on suspicion of theft from a motor vehicle at a shop on High Lane in Burslem at about 7.30am in connection with an incident last month. He has since been released under investigation as enquiries continue.

A search of his home address and a garage in Middleport were also conducted. These led to the arrest of a 22-year-old man from Stoke-on-Trent for possession of a Taser. The weapon was seized and the 22-year-old man has also been released under investigation as enquiries continue.
