A second arrest has been made in connection with an incident where a tent was set on fire in Longton, Stoke-on-Trent at around 8.15pm on December 29, 2020.

The 16-year-old, from Stoke-on-Trent, was arrested on suspicion of arson on Thursday (28 January) after a CCTV appeal was issued with the image of somebody they wished to talk to in relation to the incident.

Officers wish to thank the public for the responses they received to that appeal.

Investigations will now continue.

While a woman was in the tent at the time of the incident, she fortunately suffered no injuries. Staffordshire Police have also worked closely with partner agencies to support the woman and offered her alternative accommodation, along with ongoing help and support.

Another 16-year-old was previously arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life. He was bailed with conditions while enquiries continued.

Anyone with any information should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook or Twitter quoting incident number 0637 of December 29, call 101 or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
