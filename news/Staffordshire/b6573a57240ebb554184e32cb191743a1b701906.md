Officers made two arrests and seized suspected class A drugs, cash and phones in Cannock.

Now investigations are ongoing following the discoveries in the town on Monday as the force continues to clamp down on drug misuse in the county.

Officers stopped a man where officers went on to seize suspected class A drugs thought to be heroin and crack cocaine, cash and two phones. As a result a 39-year-old man, of Cannock, was arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply. He was later released under investigation.

A search was also carried out at a property on Cannock's Hunter Road where scales, cash, and phones were recovered. A 43-year-old woman, of Cannock, was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a class A drug. She was later released under investigation.

Detective Sergeant Jon Bradbury, of Staffordshire Police's Disruption Team (South), said: "Our investigations over drug misuse and supply in Cannock are ongoing. But we are pleased to have taken a quantity of drugs off the streets this week. We would ask anyone with information to get in touch and allow us to act on their concerns."

Anyone with concerns over drug misuse should message Staffordshire Police on Facebook, or alternatively contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
