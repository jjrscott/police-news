Detectives from Staffordshire Police are appealing for witnesses after a carjacking in Wolstanton this morning (Monday 20 January).

At around 1am a grey Vauxhall Astra was stolen from Asda car park, after the 19-year-old driver of the vehicle was approached by two Asian men who sprayed a substance in his face.

Both the driver and passenger were threatened and forced out of the car, which was then driven away in convoy with a dark-coloured Volkswagen.

Officers have confirmed that the substance was non-corrosive and believe it was used as a distraction for the robbery.

Fortunately, the occupants of the vehicle were not seriously injured but were both understandably shocked and shaken by the incident.

An investigation is underway and anyone with any information is asked to call 101 or send a private message on Facebook or Twitter, quoting incident number 0018 of 20 January. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
