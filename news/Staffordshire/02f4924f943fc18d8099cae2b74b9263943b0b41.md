A woman in the Staffordshire Moorlands has been handed a £1000 fine after failing to self-isolate having holidayed in Turkey.

The woman from Werrington - who should have been self-isolating for 14 days - was found to have breached regulations after officers carried out checks at her home and she wasn't there. It's believed she had gone to work.

The check-up was carried out as part of our regular observation on those self-isolating across the Staffordshire, following correspondence with Border Force officials.

As well as being handed the £1000 fine, the woman was reminded that if she breaches regulations again the fine will double.

Chief Inspector Mark Thorley, commander for the Staffordshire Moorlands Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We know the vast majority of people are behaving responsibly by adhering to the Covid legislation and self-isolating when they should be.

"However, there is a very small minority who are breaking the law and think that the rules simply do not apply to them.

"We will continue with our approach to engage, explain and encourage but enforcement action will be taken where people are knowingly breaching the regulations.

"The threat of Coronavirus has not gone away and it is important that we all continue to follow the restrictions put in place to prevent its spread and protect us."
