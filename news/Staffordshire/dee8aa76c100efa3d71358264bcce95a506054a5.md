Officers are appealing for information after a child suffered head injuries in a collision in Endon.

Police were called by West Midlands Ambulance Service to Church Lane at 2.35pm on Saturday (7 November) following reports that a boy had fallen off a push bike. It is not believed any other vehicles were involved.

A 15-year-old suffered head injuries and was taken to the Royal Stoke University Hospital by ambulance where he remains in a stable condition.

Officers from the Staffordshire and West Midlands Serious Collision Investigation Unit are appealing for witnesses who may have seen the bike before the collision or anyone with relevant dashcam footage to contact 101, quoting incident 342 of 7 November.
