Officers made three arrests as part of an operation to crack down on drug dealing in Tamworth.

The arrests were made between 2pm and 4pm on Friday afternoon (June 12).

A blue Ford Focus was stopped in Sandy Way, Tamworth and a 30-year-old man from the local area was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply cocaine.

Shortly after officers stopped a black Vauxhall in Buckingham Road. A local man, aged 38, was arrested for being concerned in the supply of class A drugs. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Finally, two men were searched in Tame Drive. A 22-year-old from the West Midlands was arrested for being concerned in the supply of class A drugs. Another man, aged 23, was cautioned for possession of cannabis.
