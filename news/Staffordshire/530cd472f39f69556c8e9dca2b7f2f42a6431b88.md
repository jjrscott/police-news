A 48-year-old man who was caught dealing drugs in Stafford has been jailed for 45 months.

Narinder Bhatia pleaded guilty to supplying and possessing cocaine when he surrendered himself to Stafford Crown Court on Friday (Oct 18).

The court heard that Bhatia, of Darnford Close, Parkside, was watched by officers as he approached another man in his car close to the junction of Cowan Drive and Weston Road, in Stafford, on 12 December last year.

A deal took place and Bhatia was arrested. Bhatia's car was searched and officers found a throwing knife concealed in the driver's door compartment and a baseball bat in the boot.

During a search of Bhatia's home address officers found a quantity of cocaine, £1,070 in cash, digital scales and deal bags.

The cocaine seized had a potential street value of £360 to £550.

Bhatia, also known as Mohammed Aslam, also pleaded guilty to possessing a knife or blade. Two further counts of possessing an offensive weapon and acquiring criminal property will lie on file.

Sergeant Tom Fotherby, of Stafford Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We hope this sends out a clear message that we will not tolerate drug dealing in Stafford.

"This is the third conviction we've secured in the last fortnight and we will continue to focus on bringing dealers before the courts."
