Police officers in Tamworth have received a generous donation of washing bags from a local sewing group.

The Tamworth Sewing Volunteers, made up of over 200 talented individuals, have come together during this unprecedented time and make scrubs, washing bags, scrub caps and mask extensions for frontline workers.

Chief Inspector Ash Farrington, commander of Tamworth Neighbourhood Policing Team, met with group co-ordinator Emma today to collect a selection of wash-bags - which uniforms can be stored and washed in - for local police officers.

He said: "Yet again, the community spirit of Tamworth leaves you feeling very humble. At such a difficult time, so many people have done what they can to help which is amazing."

Anyone who is interested in receiving these protective items or helping with the cause, can contact the group by searching 'Tamworth Sewing Volunteers' on Facebook.
