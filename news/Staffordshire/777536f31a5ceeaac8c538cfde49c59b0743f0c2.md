Officers from Staffordshire Police have called off the search for missing person Kenneth Gallagher of Wolstanton.

Sadly, the body of a man, which has been formally identified as 64-year-old Kenneth, was found yesterday morning (Friday 11 December) in Hartshill.

His family have been informed and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.

We would like to thank colleagues, partner agencies and the public for their assistance and support during the search.

Detectives do not believe there are any suspicious circumstances and a report will be prepared for HM Coroner.
