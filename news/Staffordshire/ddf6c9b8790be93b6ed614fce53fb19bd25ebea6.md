A Cannock man has been jailed for 32 weeks after he admitted elbowing a police officer in the face and coughing into the face of a second officer stating he had COVID-19.

Sean Pearson, 31, arrived at Redhill Road, Chadsmoor, on Saturday afternoon after he learned another motorcyclist had been detained and arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.

As Pearson was not involved in the initial incident he was repeatedly asked to leave the area and return home.

Pearson, who lives nearby in Chadsmoor, refused, remaining in the street and arguing with police officers.

He refused to provide his details and was arrested. During the arrest Pearson elbowed a police officer in the face.

Once in custody Pearson stated he had COVID-19 and coughed into another officer's face. Following CPS advice Pearson was charged with two counts of assaulting an emergency worker.

Pearson pleaded guilty to both counts of assaulting an emergency worker via video-link at North Staffordshire Justice Centre this morning (April 27).

The first motorcyclist has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Chief Inspector Becky Hyde, area commander of Cannock Chase Neighbourhood Policing Team, said officers were patrolling the area and became concerned when they saw a group of motorcyclists congregating.

"The approach was to offer advice and move these riders on so they would disperse, maintain social distancing and prevent anti-social behaviour problems. Pearson resisted and then assaulted our officers resulting in a jail term.

"We want to work with our communities and, while the majority of people are being responsible, we will put those who think they can flout the regulations or harm our officers before the courts."
