### Fatal collision | Can you help?

We'd like to speak to anyone who witnessed a collision at around 8.45pm last night (Friday, December 4) on Penygroes Road in Blaenau near Llandybie.

One car - a white Vauxhall Corsa - was involved, and tragically a 20-year-old man died at the scene.

Our thoughts are with his family, who are being supported by our officers.

Anyone with information that could help officers establish what happened is asked to contact the Serious Collision Investigation Unit.

Please quote ref 314 of December 4.
