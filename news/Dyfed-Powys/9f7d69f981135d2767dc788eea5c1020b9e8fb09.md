A MAN who stashed over £4,000 worth of class A drugs in deodorant containers has been jailed for more than two years.

Dyfed-Powys Police used CCTV footage showing Marcus Diconstanzo, of Newtown, bulk-buying deodorant from Tesco to prove they belonged to the 29-year-old after he denied the cocaine-filled bottles were his.

He was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply in June 2019 when officers carried out a warrant at his home in Swallow Drive.

Officer in case, DC Matthew Harries of the Powys Proactive Policing Team said: "A large quantity of cocaine was found hidden in roll-on deodorants, cash was hidden in DVD cases, and digital scales were found behind wall pictures.

"A bag containing five unopened deodorant bottles and a Tesco receipt were found in a cabinet, so enquiries were immediately carried out to determine who had bought them.

"While the defendant denied they were his, footage clearly showed him making the purchase a couple of weeks earlier."

Analysis determined that 51 wraps and a further 14 grams of a high purity cocaine had been seized by officers, with a street value of £100 per gram. The estimated value of the haul was £4,125.

Fingerprints on the foil wraps were proven to be Diconstanzo's, and he was charged with possession of class A drugs with intent to supply.

He admitted the charge at Mold Crown Court on Thursday, July 23 and was sentenced to 27 months in prison.
