Dyfed-Powys Police is proud to be supporting the campaign to end male violence against women. The force has taken a stand to end all male violence against women by becoming White Ribbon Accredited.

White Ribbon is a global campaign that encourages people, and especially men and boys, to individually and collectively take action and change the behaviour and culture that leads to abuse and violence. To wear a white ribbon is to promise to never to commit, excuse or remain silent about male violence against women.

Each year domestic abuse services and partners hold events to raise the profile of the campaign and White Ribbon Day itself, which takes place on November 25.

This year has been particularly difficult for many due to the Coronavirus regulations and restrictions, and it is more important than ever that we shine a light on domestic violence as it primarily happens behind closed doors. We work closely with our partner agencies, and we would reassure the vulnerable that the support available has not changed or diminished because of the unprecedented circumstances we have found ourselves in this year.

A White Ribbon Pledge Book has been made available for men to sign to make their pledge. Police and Crime Commissioner Dafydd Llywelyn and Chief Constable Mark Collins have made their pledges.

Chief Constable Mark Collins said: "More than two women in the UK are killed every week as a result of violence perpetrated by men, and the White Ribbon Campaign is an opportunity for men to say 'no more'. I've made my pledge not to commit, excuse or remain silent about violence against women. I hope more men will join me and make their own pledge. I also want victims to have the confidence to report domestic violence to us - we are here for you and together with our partners can provide the help and support you need."

Dyfed Powys Police and Crime Commissioner Dafydd Llywelyn added: "The White Ribbon Campaign is such an important message: Creating a future without male violence against women. Not only does domestic abuse have a long lasting effect on the victim, but also the whole family. Ninety percent of children are in the same room, or next door to the violence in their home, and this can cause a myriad of issues for the child. Experiencing abuse in the home is one of the adverse childhood experiences that has been shown to significantly increase vulnerability and risk in adulthood.

"As Police and Crime Commissioner, I commission services to support all victims of domestic abuse in the Dyfed-Powys area. I am aware of the impact that this recent increase in demand has had on our service providers and how vital it is that the support is able to continue during these challenging times. Therefore, along with staff from my Office, I have worked hard during the pandemic to source additional funding to support them.

"It is my hope that people will take the opportunity today to help raise awareness of domestic abuse through the White Ribbon Campaign: Join us in pledging never to take part, condone or stay silent about violence against women."

Dyfed-Powys Police achieved accreditation as a result of working with White Ribbon UK to draft a 3 year action plan to set the goals which will ensure we tackle violence against women. The action plan is our commitment to achieve the best service for vulnerable victims and survivors, and that we improve wherever possible.
