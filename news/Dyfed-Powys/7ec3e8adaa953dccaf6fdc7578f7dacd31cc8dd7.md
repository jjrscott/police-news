#### LLANDYSUL | Have you seen David Phillips?

We are concerned for the welfare of David Phillips - known locally as Noz - who is missing from his home in Llandysul.

We believe the 51-year-old is likely to still be in the immediate area, so are appealing directly to people living in the town for help.

If you have seen David in the past few days, please get in contact so we can ensure he is safe and well.

There is no recent photograph available to us at present, but we believe David is well known in the town and hope anyone who has seen him would recognise him.

He is described as around 5ft 6in tall, of medium build, with shaved brown hair.

You can contact us in one of the following ways:
