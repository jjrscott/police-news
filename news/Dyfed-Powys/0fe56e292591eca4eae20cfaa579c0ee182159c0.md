**Dyfed-Powys Police is supporting a national day to remember those who have died during the pandemic, and to show support for everyone who has been bereaved.**

Spearheaded by end of life charity Marie Curie, and set to take place on Tuesday 23 March - the anniversary of the UK going into the first national lockdown - Dyfed-Powys Police is committed to supporting the National Day of Reflection, alongside a host of organisations, MPs, and celebrities who are backing the day.

Marie Curie estimates that over three million people have been bereaved since the pandemic began, yet many have been unable to properly say goodbye to loved ones or grieve.

The National Day of Reflection will give the nation and communities a moment to remember, grieve and celebrate everyone who has died during this time and show support for our families, friends and colleagues who are grieving.

Temporary Chief Constable (T/CC) Claire Parmenter said: "This last year, many of us have experienced loss in some way - from Covid and others causes.

"I have witnessed the pain that many of us are enduring, the compassion we show for others and strong sense of community spirit that unites us.

"We as a policing family shall continue to support our communities through these very difficult times. On the National Day of Remembrance, we will be pausing at noon to reflect on those who have died and connect with others who have been bereaved."
