#### Officers responded to a fatal collision involving a cyclist and a van on the A40 westbound dual carriageway near Bancyfelin at around 6:40pm yesterday evening (Thursday, February 25).

Tragically the female cyclist died at the scene. Our thoughts are with her family at this time, and specialist support has been made available.

The driver of the van was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, and has been released on bail.

Enquiries into the circumstances of the collision are ongoing, and any witnesses are asked to come forward.

If you saw the incident and have not yet spoken with police, if you might have seen the cyclist or van involved prior to the collision, or have dash cam footage, please contact the Serious Collision Unit as soon as possible.
