The Dyfed Powys Local Resilience Forum is working together to protect communities in relation to large groups staying in rental properties.

The Forum - made up of local Councils, Health boards and emergency service representatives - is appealing to owners following an incident where a rented farm was used to host an illegal rave style party, in clear contravention of coronavirus rules.

Without swift police intervention, the numbers involved would likely have rapidly increased.

Superintendent Anthony Evans, divisional commander for Pembrokeshire, said: "We're appealing to rental property owners, to be aware of the potential risks associated with rentals leading up to and over the festive period.

"I urge property owners to be professionally curious when engaging with prospective customers to ensure compliance.

"These gatherings are putting lives at risk of those attending and the local communities. I would urge both residents and property owners to be vigilant, to help stop the spread of the virus."

A local resilience forum (LRF) is a multi-agency forum formed in a police area of the UK by key emergency responders and specific supporting agencies. It is a requirement of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004. An LRF allows responders access to a forum to consult, collaborate and disclose information with each other to facilitate planning and response to emergencies, and produce a community risk register.
