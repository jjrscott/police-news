A man has been issued with two fines in 24 hours for flouting Coronavirus legislation, as police thank those who are following the new rules.

Dyfed-Powys Police officers in Carmarthenshire stopped the 22-year-old from Llanelli twice for being out of the house without a reasonable excuse.

A report was made on April 1 that three men were breaching the COVID-19 legislation by gathering in Llanstephan. A woman who had attempted to film the men reported that they had stolen her phone and driven away.

Officers quickly linked the car to a suspect and traced it driving towards Carmarthen and then Llanelli, and a roads policing unit was directed to the area.

The car was stopped, and the two occupants - a 22-year-old from Llanelli, and a 18-year-old from Carmarthen - were arrested on suspicion of theft. They were also both issued with tickets for COVID-19 offences.

T/Chief Inspector Tom Sharville said: "We are taking the new legislation seriously, and would like to thank the majority of people who are staying home to keep others safe.

"The measures are difficult to adapt to, but it is important that we stay at home to save lives.

"However, there is a minority out there who are under the impression the legislation does not apply to them, and are flouting the law.

"This was the second fine one of these men was issued with in 24 hours, after he showed a clear disregard for all guidelines."

The men were arrested on suspicion of theft of a mobile phone, and were released under investigation pending further enquiries.
