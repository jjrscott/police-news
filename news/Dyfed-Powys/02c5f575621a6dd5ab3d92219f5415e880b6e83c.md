Dyfed-Powys Police is increasingly concerned for the welfare of David Phillips - known locally as Noz - who is still missing from his home in Llandysul.

He is also known by the name David Rees Wilding.

We believe the 51-year-old could still be in the immediate area, and are appealing directly to people living in the town for help.

However, he also has links with Swansea and Cardiff.

He is described as around 5ft 6in tall, of medium build, with shaved brown hair.

If you have seen David in the past few days, please get in contact with us. We are also keen to hear from any of David's family members, whether or not you know where he is.

You can let us know any information in one of the following ways:

Online at bit.ly/DavidPhillipsAppeal

By phone on 101

**If you know where David is now, please call us on 999 so that we can ensure he is safe and well.**
