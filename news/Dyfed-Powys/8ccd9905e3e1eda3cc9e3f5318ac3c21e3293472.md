On 9 November, the firebreak restrictions came to an end. There is now a new set of national measures, which will replace the previous restrictions.

Businesses which were required to close during the firebreak are able to reopen, with the requirement to stay home being removed, and restrictions on meeting people being changed.

However, we will all need to work hard to keep Wales safe by following some simple guidance to protect each other, manage pressure on the NHS and reduce the risk that further firebreaks are needed.

**For updated guidance on the new measures, and the answers to most questions, visit the Welsh Government FAQs here. **
Please, help us by visiting this website for information, keeping our lines free for emergency and non-emergency police matters.
