Police are warning people not to attempt off-road biking over the bank holiday after 19 men were stopped and fined last weekend.

COVID-19 fixed penalty notices were issued to the group, who had travelled to hills near Newtown on Saturday, May 2.

A report had been made to Dyfed-Powys Police than several off-road vehicles and vans had entered the area, and extensive searches were carried out to locate them.

A police inspector spotted the group on his way home, and alerted Newtown officers.

Five vehicles and 19 men were stopped. Four men from one van had decamped from the vehicle and were found hiding in a wooded area.

The men had travelled from the Merseyside area.

PC Hamer said: "This showed excellent work across divisions to respond to the concerns of our communities.

"Off-roading is a problem all over Powys, causing damage to footpaths, bridleways and tracks, and green lanes in forestry areas and common land. Not only that, but as we saw last weekend people are actually breaching the current legislation to come into the area for off-roading.

"Officers will be out and about again this weekend ensuring people are following the guidelines. We urge people to stay safe at home."
