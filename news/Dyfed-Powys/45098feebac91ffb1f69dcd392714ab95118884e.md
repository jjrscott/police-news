Officers are carrying out searches and house-to-house enquiries in the Ferryside area for Susan, who was last seen at 1.30pm Saturday 27th February 2021, walking in the Carmarthen Bay Holiday Village, Kidwelly area.

This week there has been an extensive search for Susan, including support from Mountain Rescue, Coastguard, the NPAS helicopter, use of Fire and Rescue Service drone and specialist dogs.
