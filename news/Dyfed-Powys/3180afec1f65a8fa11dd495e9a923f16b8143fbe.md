#### Robbery appeal | Can you help?

We are investigating a report of an attempt robbery at around 10.50am today (Tuesday, December 8) in a lay-by on the A487 between Plwmp and Synod Inn.

As search was carried out involving officers, armed response and the NPAS helicopter, and officers remain in the area.

We're keen to speak to a man believed to have been in the area at the time, who is described as around 20 years old, 6ft tall, slight build, with dark complexion and short blonde/light hair.

He was wearing a green parka jacket with dark coloured jeans which had faded patches.

We'd also like to hear from anyone who was travelling the A487 in either direction between Pentregat and Synod Inn between 10am and 11.30am who might have seen this man walking, or has dash cam footage that may have captured him.
