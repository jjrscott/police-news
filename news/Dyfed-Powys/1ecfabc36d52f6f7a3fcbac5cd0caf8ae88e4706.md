TWO men have been arrested after police found cocaine worth between £13,000 and £16,000 in their car.

Dyfed-Powys Police officers proactively intercepted the vehicle on the A40 near Bwlch in Powys on Tuesday, February 2.

Led by the Powys Proactive Team, with support from the Brecon Roads policing Unit, the dog unit, tactical desk and search team officers, the car was searched, with Police Dog Barney locating a fist-sized lump of white powder.

The powder is suspected to be cocaine, with an estimated street value between £13,000 and £16,000, and has been sent for analysis.

When asked where they were going, the passenger claimed they had been to Abergavenny for a McDonalds.

The pair - aged 19 and 25, and from Brecon - were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs. They have been released on bail pending further enquiries.

Detective Inspector Andrew Griffiths said: "This operation was the result of excellent coordinated work by a number of teams, who came together to conduct a successful stop.

"Drug dealers are taking a gamble with trying to bring large amounts of illegal substances into the area, and we will continue to act proactively to stop them.

"This seizure has prevented a large amount of class A drugs from entering the supply chain in Powys."
