As we mourn the loss of Sergeant Lynwen Thomas, a memorial service has been held to honour her life and to give thanks for her dedication to Dyfed-Powys.

Speaking from the Memorial Garden at police headquarters in Llangunnor, Temporary Chief Constable Claire Parmenter described the joy Sgt Thomas brought to her colleagues, as well as the force's collective sorrow from the tragedy.

"That joy we will forever cherish; the memories of her will never die," T/CC Parmenter said.

A minute's silence was held to remember Sgt Thomas and to think of her loved ones.

Chief Inspector Elaine Bendle then read a poem entitled For Lynwen, describing her former colleague as a hero and "the most selfless woman by far".

Retired force chaplain Tom Evans and Police and Crime Commissioner Dafydd Llywelyn closed the service with a prayer and grace.

To allow those affected by Sgt Thomas's death to take comfort from the service, her family has kindly allowed a recording to be shared with colleagues and friends outside the force.

**For Lynwen**

There are heroes who walk among us

Never looking for glory or praise

They don't seek recognition

For their thoughtful, caring ways.

Living lives of deep commitment

Providing for those they hold dear

Steadfast with a quiet strength

Through times of laughter & tears.

Lynwen was a person like that to me

The most selfless woman by far

So Lynwen I'd like to thank you

For being the hero that you are
