**Fatal collision | can you help?**

We would like to speak to anyone who witnessed a collision at around 10.30pm last night (Saturday, December 5) on the A470 at Storey Arms (the area known locally as RAC bends).

One vehicle - a black Mini Cooper - was involved.

Sadly, a 19-year-old man, who was the only person in the car, sustained fatal injuries and passed away at the scene.

His family are being supported by our officers.

Anyone who saw the Mini Cooper in the area at the relevant time, or has dashcam footage is asked to contact the Serious Collision Investigation Unit quoting reference DP-20201205-339.
