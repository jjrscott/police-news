#### It is with great sadness that we confirm the tragic and sudden loss of a member of the Dyfed-Powys Police family.

Sergeant Lynwen Thomas was a well-respected serving police officer, who passed away following a collision yesterday evening.

Our thoughts are with her family, friends and colleagues, who have all been offered specialist support.

We ask that family members are given the privacy they need at this difficult time.
