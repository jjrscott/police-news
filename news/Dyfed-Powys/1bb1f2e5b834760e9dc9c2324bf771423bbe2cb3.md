#### We are looking to get your thoughts around the use of automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) in Dyfed-Powys

ANPR technology is used by police forces across the UK - including Dyfed-Powys Police - to help detect, deter and disrupt criminality, including organised crime groups and terrorists.

The registration plate cameras are governed by strict codes of practice. They are most commonly used to alert officers to stolen vehicles, vehicles that have been involved in crime or to help locate missing people. The data they collect can also be used in investigations.

You've probably seen how ANPR works from TV programmes or you may even use a petrol station or car park which uses the system to keep you safe. Just in case you haven't, West Midlands Police have made a short film showing the use of ANPR in locating a missing person. Watch it here...

ANPR is a vital tool to help policing stay one step ahead of criminals and better protect people. Your views play an important part in how we do this.

The anonymous survey is open from 15th February and closes on the 7th March and will only take a few minutes of your time to complete.
