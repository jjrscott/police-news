We begin our Women's History Month celebrations today, on International Women's Day. A day focused on celebrating women's achievements, raising awareness for women's equality and working towards a gender equal world.

This year's International Women's Day theme is 'ChooseToChallenge', encouraging both men and women to challenge gender bias and inequality.

Our story starts with our first WPCs which include Elsie Joan Baldwin - who joined Glamorgan Constabulary in 1948. From here, she faced stereotypes head on and providing resilience in what had previously been 'a world of men.'

Throughout the month you can expect to hear more about the stories and contributions of women in our force from various ranks and roles focusing on different ways they have chosen to challenge throughout their careers.

We'll also be posting a 3D virtual exhibition - Follow us @swpolice for more.
