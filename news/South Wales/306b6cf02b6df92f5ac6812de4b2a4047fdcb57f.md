We can only imagine how difficult the past year has been for Christopher's family and the pain and grief that they are enduring after his tragic death following an incident in the River Cynon in July 2019.

The family made an appeal of the decision by the Crown Prosecution Service as is absolutely their right under the Victim's Right to Review process.

That review has now taken place and has upheld the original decision of the CPS not to prosecute anyone in connection with Christopher's death. That process is entirely independent of South Wales Police.

South Wales Police referred the police investigation to the Independent Office for Police Conduct who continue to examine our response and subsequent investigation into the tragic circumstances surrounding Christopher's death.

We are absolutely committed to implementing any opportunities for learning by South Wales Police.

The tragic death of Christopher deeply shocked the local community as well and we continue to work closely with support agencies to ensure the right help is there for all those that need it.
