Following Welsh Government confirmation on Friday (February 19) that Alert Level 4 Restrictions would continue largely unchanged in Wales for a further three weeks, South Wales Police continued to respond to a large number of reported breaches at the weekend.

Between Friday and Monday, the force received more than 550 Covid-related calls - a 20% increase on the previous weekend - and while many were well-intended but did not amount to breaches, officers still had cause to issue 278 fines for parties, gatherings, travel in to Wales and car-sharing.

Among those subject to enforcement action for breaching Covid regulations were:

 * A barber operating from his Bridgend home, along with two customers;
 * Seven attendees of a Tonypandy house party who'd travelled from Newport, Cardiff, Swansea, Pontypool and Wolverhampton;
 * Eight attendees of a house party in Maesteg;
 * Five attendees at a gathering in Treforest;
 * Nine attendees of a house party in Mountain Ash;
 * Seven adults who attended a party at a flat in Adamsdown with their children;
 * Three attendees of a gathering at a house in Gabalfa;
 * Four occupants of a car subject to a vehicle check in Cardiff city centre; the car was also seized and the owner reported for driving without insurance;
 * 47 attendees of five different house parties and gatherings in Cathays;
 * 14 attendees of a house party in Riverside;
 * Six fines for a 17th birthday party in Canton;
 * Four members of three separate families gathered at an address in Canton;
 * Five attendees of a 30th birthday party in hired accommodation in St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan, with one person travelling from Yorkshire to attend;
 * 10 fines for two separate house parties in Grangetown;
 * Six for attendees of a house party in Pentwyn;
 * Seven fines for a house party in Ely;
 * Four men found leaving a business premises in Swansea city centre;
 * Seven attendees of a party in Seven Sisters, Neath.

Post-incident enquiries are also ongoing with partners, including the Joint Enforcement Teams, universities and local authorities, in relation to a number of incidents, and retrospective action will be taken where necessary and appropriate.

Chief Superintendent Andy Valentine, who is leading South Wales Police's response to the pandemic, praised those who are continuing to support the collective effort to slow the spread of the virus and who are growing increasingly frustrated with the minority who are breaching the regulations.

Chief Supt Valentine added:

"Flagrant breaches cannot be tolerated and we will continue to respond to concerns from our communities, carry out proactive patrols and work closely with our local authority partners on the Joint Enforcement Teams to ensure those who blatantly or repeatedly breach the rules are met with enforcement action."
