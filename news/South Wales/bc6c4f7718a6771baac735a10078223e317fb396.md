A gang of county line drug dealers have been jailed for a total of over 15 years after a proactive stop by our Op Sceptre team.

The team stopped the vehicle in Gors Avenue, Swansea in August last year and following an investigation by our proactive policing team all four occupants pleaded guilty and been sentenced for possession with intent to supply to Class A drugs:

Omar Abdi, aged 28, of Hillingdon, 5.5 years and

Osman Ishmail, aged 35, of Mount Pleasant, 4 years

Marc Cairns, aged 44, of Clydach, 3.5 years

Ian Morris, aged 43, of Clydach 2 years and four months

Detective Inspector Marc Gardner said:

"Disruption of the drug dealing and enforcement remains central to tackling county lines and criminality with the ultimate aim to make South Wales a hostile environment for organised crime groups, preventing all forms of harm associated with these gangs.

"Our officers daily take proactive action and we have designated plain clothes in our communities with the key aim of disrupting and tackling drug dealers and organised criminals who target the most vulnerable members of our community.

"If you suspect drug dealing is taking place or you are concerned that a young person or vulnerable adult may have been targeted by an organised crime group, please tell us. You don't have to be certain, just concerned.

"Call us on 101 or if you prefer you can contact Crimestoppers to report anonymously - online or by calling 0800 555 111. If someone is in immediate danger or a crime is taking place you should always dial 999."
