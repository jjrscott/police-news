As we move into the weekend our officers and staff will once again be patrolling South Wales to help keep residents safe. We are asking the public to help us by adhering to the ongoing Alert level 4 coronavirus restrictions to help minimise the spread of Coronavirus

As a result of concerns being raised by the public, and previous significant breaches of the travel restrictions, officers will be carrying out road checks around, parks, car parks and seaside locations in the Cardiff, Porthcawl, Barry and Penarth areas. Those travelling to these areas without a reasonable excuse should expect to be stopped and issued with a Fixed penalty notice.

These checks are being carried out from 05 March - 08 March under powers set out in Regulation 35 of the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) (No.5) (Wales) Regulations 2020. **Superintendent Claire Evans said:**

"We understand that the restrictions are causing challenges, and we are grateful to the vast majority of residents who are continuing to do the right thing and are following the rules to protect themselves, their loved ones and the NHS.

"However the improved weather is leading to more people thinking it's okay to break the rules. Flagrant breaches cannot be tolerated and we will continue to respond to concerns from our communities, carry out proactive patrols and work closely with our local authority partners on the Joint Enforcement Teams to ensure those who blatantly or repeatedly breach the rules are met with enforcement action."
