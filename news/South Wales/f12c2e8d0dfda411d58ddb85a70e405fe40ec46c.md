The family of a man who died following a collision on the A4061 Rhigos Road in Treherbert have paid tribute to him.

Jeff Rawle died at the scene of the collision, which occurred shortly after 7pm on Thursday, December 17, and involved his blue Mazda and an ambulance.

His passenger was seriously injured and remains in hospital, while the driver of the ambulance was treated for minor injuries.

Paying tribute to the 47-year-old, his family said: "Jeff was a loving son, brother and a devoted dad to his daughter Gabby. They were so close as father and daughter, she loved him beyond words. Gabby is inconsolable with grief by the tragic passing of her father. Jeff would always call Gabby 'Daddy's girl' and these memories will live on.

"His sudden death has left a massive hole in our hearts and lives and we as a family are completely devastated, as we try and make sense of what has happened.

"Jeff was from the Treherbert area of the Rhondda and he was loved and liked by so many. He will be missed."

Officers from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit are continuing to investigate the circumstances of the collision and would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the collision, or the manner in which either vehicle was being driven prior to it.

Anyone with dashcam or mobile phone footage which could assist the investigation is also urged to get in touch.

**Please contact 101 quoting reference 2000456336.**

*Mr Rawle's family do not wish to issue a picture with this tribute.
