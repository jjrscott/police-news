Officers have been given additional powers to direct people to leave Cardiff city centre as detectives continue to investigate a violent disturbance which left six people in hospital.

A section 35 dispersal order has been imposed for a designated area (see attached map), enabling officers to direct individuals or groups to leave the area for 24 hours if their behaviour has, or is likely to contribute to disorder or cause harassment, alarm or distress to members of the public.

Detective Superintendent Esyr Jones said: "We want our local communities to be reassured that we are doing all we can to identify all those involved in Saturday's wholly unacceptable violence, and that the city centre remains a safe place to visit.

"These powers will enable officers to stop anyone they suspect is behaving in an antisocial manner, or who is visiting the area to cause any trouble, and direct them to leave.

"Patrols have been stepped up in the area and a dedicated team continues to investigate Saturday's incident."

Four youths, aged 16 and 17, have been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder and remain in police custody.

Four people remain in hospital with varying injuries which, while serious, are not thought to be life-threatening.

A number of enquiries are ongoing, and officers are continuing to appeal to anyone who has any information but has not yet spoken to officers, to come forward.

Reiterating his earlier appeal Det Supt Jones added: "In particular, I'd urge any parent who suspects their child was involved in any way to come forward. Tackling knife crime is the responsibility of us all and any parents who have suspicions about their children being involved are not protecting them by remaining quiet."

**Anyone with information is urged to contact 101, quoting occurrence 2000424668.**

**Crimestoppers can also be contacted 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.**
