On Wednesday, March 24, 2021 a misconduct panel chaired by an independent Legally Qualified Chair (LQC) concluded a hearing where they had considered alleged breaches of the standards of professional behaviour regarding a South Wales Police Inspector.

The hearing had considered issues of Honesty and Integrity regarding the officer's failure to investigate a reported complaint and then his actions in attempting to reassure colleagues that the work had been completed.

The officer admitted the breaches and received a Final Written Warning which will last for a term of 18 months.

The hearing was held in private as determined by the LQC and no further information will be published.
