More than 70 people were fined for attending house parties throughout south Wales at the weekend - one of whom was subsequently charged for assaulting a police officer.

Despite the whole of Wales continuing to be subject to Alert Level 4 coronavirus restrictions, a small minority continued to breach the rules by attending house parties and travelling without reasonable excuse.

South Wales Police responded to 552 Covid-related incidents between Friday and Monday, and while no breaches were identified in many, officers still had cause to issue 134 fixed penalty notices (FPNs).

Among them were:

 * 13 FPNs issued to attendees of a party at Maritime Quarter, Swansea;
 * Four FPNs to attendees of a birthday party in Swansea - two of whom were guests who'd travelled from London;
 * Six FPNs issued for a party at a flat in Riverside, Cardiff;
 * Three FPNs for occupants of a van which was subject to a vehicle check. All were from different households and had 'got together to celebrate a birthday';
 * Six FPNs to men gathering to drink alcohol in Canton, Cardiff;
 * Six FPNs for attendees of a party in Cathays, Cardiff;
 * 15 FPNS for attendees of a flat party in Splott;
 * Four occupants from different addresses who were found car-sharing in Sully, Vale of Glamorgan;
 * Seven FPNs to attendees of a house party on Barry Waterfront;
 * Eight FPNs for a house party in Grangetown, Cardiff;
 * Six FPNs to attendees of a house party in Treherbert, Rhondda;
 * Six FPNs for attendees of a house party in Merthyr Tydfil;
 * Five FPNs for people from different households who were gathered in a car park in Aberaman, Cynon Valley;
 * Seven FPNs for attendees of a house party in Trowbridge, Cardiff. One attendee was arrested and has since been charged with breaching a restraining order and assaulting an emergency worker.

In addition, numerous people were fined for travelling without reasonable excuse to parks, beaches and other beauty spots.
