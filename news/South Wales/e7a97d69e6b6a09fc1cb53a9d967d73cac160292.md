The public are being urged to be vigilant following a telephone scam which duped an elderly man into handing over thousands of pounds.

The victim who is from Cardiff was contacted by somebody claiming to be from a police force in England.

He was told that he had been the victim of fraud and that counterfeit money had been deposited into his account which needs to be removed.

During a week-long period, the victim unknowingly transferred thousands of pounds into the scammers account.

A similar incident has been reported by somebody in Swansea and there are concerns others may have been targeted.

People are urged to be vigilant, and to look out for vulnerable relatives.

**Anybody who suspects that they or a relative has been targeted should immediately contact 101 orAction Fraud on 0300 123 2040.**
