People flouting Welsh Government restrictions on indoor gatherings were among more than 240 people fined by South Wales Police at the weekend.

Between Friday night and Sunday, the force received more than 400 calls related to possible Covid breaches, and 109 fines were issued in the Mid Glamorgan division alone. The division covers Bridgend, Rhondda Cynon Taff and Merthyr Tydfil, which has seen a spike in infections in recent weeks.

Among the 243 fined for blatantly breaching the coronavirus regulations were:

 * Six people at a house party in Gurnos, Merthyr Tydfil;
 * Seven people at a house party in Merthyr Tydfil;
 * 14 people gathered at an address to watch the France V Wales match on a projector in Merthyr Tydfil;
 * 11 people at an address in Penarth;
 * Six people at a party at a house in Trowbridge, Cardiff;
 * Five people at a party at an address in Riverside, Cardiff;
 * Nine people at an address in Cathays, Cardiff;
 * Five people at a house party in Butetown, Cardiff;
 * 13 people at a house party in Cathays, Cardiff;
 * Three women from different households found in a vehicle at an industrial estate in Pontardawe, Swansea Valley;
 * Four people who attended a house party in Clydach, Swansea;
 * Five people at a house party in Ystalyfera, Swansea Valley;
 * Two to a couple who allowed a group of teenagers to gather at their address in Penlan, Swansea;
 * Five attendees of a house party in St Thomas, Swansea.

The Joint Enforcement Teams in each local authority area are also continuing to take enforcement action, both on the spot and retrospectively. On Saturday, the Cardiff JET issued 27 FPNs to attendees of four parties in the Cathays area; while in Swansea a pub has been referred to licensing teams following concerns about large numbers gathered drinking at the venue.

A number of antisocial behaviour referral orders were also made after various house parties and gatherings involving under 18s were broken up across the force area, including one in Gurnos, Merthyr Tydfil, which was attended by approximately 30 youths.
