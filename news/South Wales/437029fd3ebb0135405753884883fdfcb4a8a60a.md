Assistant Chief Constable Rachel Bacon has been appointed as our new Deputy Chief Constable.

The appointment was confirmed on Tuesday following a selection process, and will see Rachel taking up the post in the coming months.

Chief Constable Jeremy Vaughan said:

"I am delighted to offer Rachel the position as my deputy and look forward to welcoming her to South Wales Police.
"As an experienced Assistant Chief Constable in Northumbria Police, who also leads nationally for the National Police Chiefs Council on mental health, I am confident that Rachel will ensure that South Wales Police continues to strive towards being the best at understanding and responding to the needs of all of our communities."
