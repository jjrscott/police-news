It is with sadness that we announce the death of our friend and colleague Police Constable 5482 Rob Parry.

Rob was based in the Hub at Cardiff Bay, having previously worked in roles across the city.

Chief Constable Jeremy Vaughan said:

"I know Rob's passing will come as a huge shock, and all at South Wales Police are devastated by the news. My sincere condolences go to Rob's loved ones, especially his closest colleagues, friends, and - of course - his family.
"Rob had been an officer with us in South Wales Police since 2013, and a PCSO and a Special Constable before that. His dedication and compassion made him a well-respected and much-loved member of our police family.
"We will do all that we can to support Rob's family at this extremely difficult time.
"Rest in peace Rob."

Rob passed away yesterday, at home. His death is not being treated as suspicious.
