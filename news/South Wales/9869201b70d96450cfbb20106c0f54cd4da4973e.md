South Wales Police is investigating the sudden and unexplained death of 24 year-old Mohamud Mohammed Hassan on Saturday, January 9.

Police were called by the Welsh Ambulance Service to a multi-occupancy property on Newport Road, Roath, shortly after 10.30pm.

Mr Hassan had been in custody at Cardiff Bay Police Station the previous night following a disturbance at the same property.

He was arrested on suspicion of breach of the peace and later released without charge which is normal procedure for this offence.

Mr Hassan left custody at around 8.30am on Saturday morning.

His death has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct as death after police contact and we are arranging the deployment of a family liaison officer to Mr Hassan's family.

As part of the South Wales Police investigation CCTV and Body Worn Video has already been, and will continue to be, examined.

This will assist in establishing and understanding the events that took place.

Early findings by the force indicate no misconduct issues and no excessive force.

We are aware of the extensive reporting on social media but due to the on-going investigation and referral to the IOPC we are unable to comment any further at this stage.

A post-mortem examination is due to take place tomorrow and until a cause of death has been confirmed we would urge against speculation.
