Seven people have now been arrested in connection with violent disorder in Cardiff city centre on Saturday night (November 21).

Detectives are continuing to investigate the incident which involved two groups of teenagers from the Grangetown and Rumney areas of Cardiff.

Six males were taken to hospital with various injuries including stab wounds and head injuries following the disorder which began in Queen Street at around 9.50pm.

Seven males, all aged 16 and 17, have been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder and have been released on bail pending further enquiries.

Further arrests are anticipated.

Detective Superintendent Esyr Jones, from South Wales Police, said:

"It is still early days in terms of the investigation but we are forming a picture of what has happened on Saturday.
"Two groups of young people have come into the city centre, some with knives, and the result is an unacceptable level of violence.
"We are still trawling through vast amounts of CCTV and speaking to a number of witnesses, and we will be relentless in identifying and arresting all those involved."

As part of the wider investigation, and to ensure Cardiff remains a safe place for all, families will be visited and offered support to help divert young people away from serious violence and knife crime.

Of the six taken to hospital, three - two aged 16 and one aged 17 - remain in hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

Det Supt Jones added:

"The awful effects of knife crime are obvious. We would urge families and community elders to speak to their children and to contact South Wales Police if they suspect their child was involved in this incident."
