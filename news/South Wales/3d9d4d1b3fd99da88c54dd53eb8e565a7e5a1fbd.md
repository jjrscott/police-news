The 61 year-old man who died following a road traffic collision on the A48 in Bridgend on Thursday, December 17, has been named as Donald Mitchell from St Brides Major in the Vale of Glamorgan.

Mr Mitchell's family has paid tribute to him, saying: "Donald was married to Sian for 34 years and a father to three daughters, Hannah, Eluned and Siriol.

"He trained in librarianship at university and worked in various roles, before becoming a librarian at UNION School of Theology, Bryntirion, nine years ago.

"Donald was an avid cyclist and was looking forward to spending time with his family in his retirement next year.

"His sad passing is an irreplaceable loss to his family, who do not grieve without hope."

South Wales Police is continuing to appeal for any witnesses to the collision which occurred at around 5.15pm on Thursday, December 17, on the A48 near Laleston, Bridgend near its junction with Wells Street.

The bicycle Mr Mitchell was riding was in collision with a blue Volvo S40. Mr Mitchell died at the scene.

A 66 year-old local man was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He is currently held at Queen's Road police station where he is being questioned.
