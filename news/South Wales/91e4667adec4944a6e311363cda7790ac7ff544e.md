"The last thing any police officer wants to do over the Christmas period is to have to issue fixed penalty notices for breaches of the Coronavirus regulations and I am appealing to the public to do the right thing so we don't have to."

Responding to the latest Welsh Government Covid-19 Alert Level 4 restrictions which came into force on December 19th, **Chief Superintendent Andy Valentine** said:

"The last thing any police officer wants to do over the Christmas period is to have to issue fixed penalty notices for breaches of the Coronavirus regulations and I am appealing to the public to do the right thing so we don't have to.

"The threat posed by COVID-19 to all communities in South Wales is very real and the Welsh Government's regulations exist to save lives and protect our NHS.

"It has been an extremely difficult year for everyone, including the officers, staff and volunteers of South Wales Police, who have been working tirelessly to support the public health response to COVID-19.

"Police officers, PCSOs and police staff colleagues will be working throughout the festive period, fighting crime and responding to the needs of some of the most vulnerable in our society.

"They know how difficult it is to be away from their own families at Christmas, and they do not want to ruin the occasion for anyone.

"So I'd again appeal for the public's support to do the right thing so we don't have to enforce the legislation."
