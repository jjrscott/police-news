The family of a man who died following a single-vehicle collision in Swansea on Thursday morning (February 4), have paid tribute to him.

Richard Clive Hixson - who was known as Clive - died at the scene of the collision, which occurred at the junction of Mayals Road and Fairwood Road shortly before 10.45am.

Paying tribute to the 65-year-old, his family said:

"Richard Clive Hixson, 'Clive' as he was known, sadly passed away suddenly on February 4.

"He is survived, and will be forever missed, by his wife, Jane, his children, Nick, Ben, Joe, and Katie, as well as seven grandchildren.

"A well-loved member of the West Cross and Mumbles communities, and a retired head of IT at the DVLA, Clive enjoyed nothing more than playing with his grandkids and watching rugby. He will be sorely missed by his family and all who knew him.

"We would like to thank the emergency services and the public who stopped and tried to help Clive at the roadside."

South wales Police is continuing to investigate the circumstances of the collision.

Anyone who witnessed the collision, or Mr Hixson's blue Toyota Yaris being driven in the moments prior to it, is asked to contact 101, quoting occurrence 2100040631.

Officers would also like to hear from two people who assisted at the scene but left prior to speaking to officers; a woman who was wearing a brown coat and possibly driving a small red car, and a man who helped to get Mr Hixson out of the car and began CPR.
