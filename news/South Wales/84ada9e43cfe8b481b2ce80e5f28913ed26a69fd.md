**Updated June 12**

South Wales Police is aware of planned protests and gatherings relating to the Black Lives Matter movement, which are advertised across the UK, including for a number of locations within our force area.

The force, and our colleagues around the country, stand alongside all those across the globe who are appalled and horrified by the way George Floyd lost his life. We recognise the strength of feeling arising from his death and the impact of discrimination and racism on our communities - something we are committed to tackling.

Protecting the public from the dangers of Coronavirus is also a continuing responsibility. We are working to engage with protest organisers and attendees in order to remind them of their obligations under the current Coronavirus legislation, including the prohibition on gatherings of more than two households and the overarching goal for everyone to take personal responsibility by following Welsh Government regulations to Keep Wales Safe.

We are duty-bound to take into account all relevant legislation and South Wales Police has strived to maintain a consistent policing style of engaging, explaining and encouraging, and enforcing as last resort where necessary, throughout this public health emergency - an approach we intend to continue throughout the weekend.
