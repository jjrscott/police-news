South Wales Police will continue to utilise additional powers to conduct random vehicle checks, following the Welsh Government move to place the whole of Wales under Alert Level 4 coronavirus restrictions.

Under Alert Level 4, the public are expected to stay at home and not travel without a reasonable excuse.

In order to support the national effort to help slow the spread of the virus, and assist in enforcing the restrictions, our officers have been given authority to stop any vehicle travelling within the force area.

Checks will be conducted to ascertain the reason for travel.

Our officers will continue to adopt the national four Es approach - engaging with the public, explaining the restrictions and encouraging voluntary compliance. However, those believed to be in blatant breach of the rules can expect to be subject to enforcement action.

The power was initially brought in from 7am on Tuesday, December 22 until Monday, January 4 and has now been extended to 9am on Monday, January 11.
