It is with great sadness that we announce the death of our friend and colleague Police Constable 6506 Kyle Burns.

Kyle, 36, was a response officer based at Cardiff Central police station.

He joined the force in 2019, having previously served with Gwent Police and the Metropolitan Police Service.

Chief Constable Jeremy Vaughan said:

"Kyle's death is incredibly sad for us all, and I know colleagues here and in the wider policing family are deeply upset by this news.

"My thoughts are with Kyle's family, friends and colleagues. Most of all, my heart goes out to his wife and young son, as well as his mum and dad."

Kyle passed away on Tuesday 9 February following a short illness.
