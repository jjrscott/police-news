Summary of a statement issued by the Independent Office for Police Conduct today:

"....there is no evidence to suggest that Mr Hassan was Tasered at any stage either prior to or during his detention."

"We are aware that there is a lot of speculation about the circumstances surrounding Mr Hassan's death and we now know that some of that is inaccurate.
"As a public body we have a duty, when we are able, to try to correct misinformation that may be in the public domain."

\--

The force continues to fully co-operate with the IOPC investigation and is providing them with information and material, including CCTV footage and body-worn video.

We acknowledge the impact Mr Hassan's death has had on his family, friends and the wider community. Our thoughts and condolences continue to be with them.
