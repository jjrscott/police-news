February is LGBT+ History month, a time where we reflect on the struggles and triumphs of the LGBT+ community, the strides that have been made towards greater equality and inclusion of all people, and consider the lessons learned from past experiences.

In marking the month, we have worked with our LGBT+ Network to produce a series of videos which reflect some of the history and journeys of our LGBT+ communities, not only from a societal perspective, but from within our police force.

One of videos produced for the month is this timeline. Throughout the clip below members of our LGBT+ Network highlight some key dates and legal breakthroughs that have inspired and strengthened the LGBT+ community we know today.

We have also produced this video piece featuring Chief Superintendent Chris Truscott, who reflects on his experiences as an officer and a member of the LGBT+ community, and discusses the progress made by South Wales Police in supporting LGBT+ equality.

**South Wales Police is committed to helping and supporting anyone who has been a victim of hate crime based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, race, disability or religion.**
