South Wales Police will be utilising additional powers to conduct random vehicle checks over the Christmas period, following the Welsh Government move to place the whole of Wales under Alert Level 4 coronavirus restrictions.

Under Alert Level 4, the public are expected to stay at home and not travel without a reasonable excuse. The restrictions will be relaxed for Christmas Day, when the public will be permitted to travel to mix with one other household.

In order to support the national effort to help slow the spread of the virus, and assist in enforcing the restrictions, our officers have been given authority to stop any vehicle travelling within the force area.

Checks will be conducted to ascertain the reason for travel.

Our officers will continue to adopt the national four Es approach - engaging with the public, explaining the restrictions and encouraging voluntary compliance. However, those believed to be in blatant breach of the rules can expect to be subject to enforcement action.

The power came in to force at 7am on Tuesday, December 22 and will be reviewed on Monday, January 4.
