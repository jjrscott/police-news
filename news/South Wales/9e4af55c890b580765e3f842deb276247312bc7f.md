The following is a summary of a statement issued by IOPC today:

"Investigators from the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) have today (Monday) served a misconduct notice on a South Wales Police officer as part of the investigation into police contact with Mohamud Mohamed Hassan prior to his death."

The misconduct notice relates to "information potentially not being passed to custody staff in charge of Mr Hassan's welfare".

"The serving of a misconduct notice does not necessarily mean an officer has committed any wrongdoing. It is to notify an officer that their conduct is being investigated."

\--

The force continues to fully co-operate with the IOPC investigation and is providing them with information and material, including CCTV footage and body-worn video.

We acknowledge the impact Mr Hassan's death has had on his family, friends and the wider community. Our thoughts and condolences continue to be with them.
