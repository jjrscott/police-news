South Wales Police held a misconduct hearing in private which concluded on Tuesday 2nd February 2021 in relation to former PC 387 Ian Sullivan.

The hearing considered a number of alleged breaches of the standards of professional behaviour namely:

 * Orders and Instructions
 * Authority Respect and Courtesy
 * Duties and responsibilities
 * Discreditable Conduct

The behaviour that constituted the breaches included breaches of policy and procedure in relation to a number issues including the administration of a drugs seizure and comments made by the former officer which were found to be both inappropriate and of a sexual nature.

The panel found these breaches to be proven against the former officer and that they constituted gross misconduct.

They delivered an outcome that had he still been a serving police officer he would have been dismissed.

The former officer will be placed on the national Police Barred List in line with police regulations.

Chief Superintendent Danny Richards, head of Professional Standards at South Wales Police, said:

"The conduct of former PC Ian Sullivan was quite simply appalling and in no way does it reflect the honesty, integrity and professionalism shown by officers and staff of South Wales Police.

"Not only did the former officer pay a total disregard to the trust placed in him by the public of South Wales, his behaviour was also intolerable to his colleagues who were subjected to his inappropriate and unacceptable attitude and comments."
