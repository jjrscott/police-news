South Wales Police acknowledges the continuing public interest in the deaths of Mandy Power, her two daughters Katie and Emily and her mother Doris Dawson in Clydach in 1999. Our thoughts remain with their family and others affected by the tragic events.

On Thursday 22nd October, BBC Wales broadcast a programme about the murders, which was the largest and most complex murder investigation ever undertaken by a Welsh police force and resulted in David George Morris being convicted following a trial at Swansea Crown Court. The conviction was overturned on appeal and he was again convicted at a retrial at Newport Crown Court and sentenced to life imprisonment.

The programme featured interviews with two members of the public who claimed they had not previously spoken to police. As you would expect, officers have now spoken to both men to establish what information they hold. We are carefully assessing this information and will determine our next course of action in due course.

The conviction of Morris for the murders has been considered by the Criminal Cases Review Commission on more than one occasion, the most recent being in 2018. Following a thorough review of the case material they decided not to refer it to the Court of Appeal as no new evidence had been identified.
