A total of 240 fines were handed out in south Wales at the weekend as officers continued to clamp down on those breaching coronavirus legislation.

While the vast majority are continuing to support the measures imposed to help slow the spread of the virus, South Wales Police officers broke up multiple house parties and gatherings and enforced numerous travel breaches.

Among the fines issued between Friday, January 29 and Sunday, January 31 were:

• Twenty for a house party in Cathays, with some of those attending having travelled from Swansea;
• Nine for a house party in Llanbethery, Vale of Glamorgan;
• Nine for a house party in Cathays;
• 13 for a house party in Llandaff North;
• Six for a house party in Fairwater;
• Six for a house party in Ely;
• Five for a house party in Cathays;
• Four for a gathering at a house in Rhoose, Vale of Glamorgan;
• Three for individuals who had travelled from Oxfordshire to Pencoed for a religious ceremony;
• Eight for a group of adults drinking alcohol in public gardens in Llandaff;
• 20 for a house party in Maerdy, Rhondda,
• Three for a group of adults drinking alcohol in a car park in Merthyr Tydfil;
• Seven for a house party in Twynyrodyn, Merthyr Tydfil;
• Eight for a group from different households in Cardiffm who were stopped in Merthyr Tydfil on their way home from Penyfan;
• Six for a house party in Perthcelyn, Mountain Ash;
• Two fines for non-essential travel to Merthyr Tydfil Leisure Village from Maerdy, RCT;
• Seven for a group gathered in a car park in Penyard, Merthyr Tydfil;
• Two for non-essential travel to Treherbert;
• Four for a group of friends from different address stopped in a vehicle in Church Village;
• One for the organiser of a surprise birthday party in Clydach, Swansea;
• Four for riders of off-road bikes in Glynneath.

Proactive vehicle checks were also carried out across the force area, including in Rhiwbina, Pontcanna and Porthcawl, with a number of fines issued for non-essential travel.

The most recent fines were issued just hours after First Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed Alert Level 4 restrictions in Wales would continue for another three weeks. They also followed a week of further enforcement action which saw numerous similar breaches including seven people gathered at a Shisha bar in Swansea, and six people training at a boxing club in Maesteg.

Chief Superintendent Andy Valentine said: "This most recent enforcement action was taken in the hours and days following the most recent Welsh Government.

"While we fully appreciate how challenging these restrictions have been, the very fact that they have been extended demonstrates that now is not the time for complacency. Blatant breaches such as the ones witnessed by our officers over the weekend compromise the progress that has been achieved by the vast majority who are following the rules, and places additional strain on our already-stretched health services.

"Such flagrant breaches cannot be tolerated and we will continue to respond to concerns from our communities, carry out proactive patrols and work closely with our local authority partners on the Joint Enforcement Teams to ensure those who blatantly or repeatedly breach the rules are met with enforcement action."
