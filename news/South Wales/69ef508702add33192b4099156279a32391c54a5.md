A South Wales Police officer has been dismissed from the force after she admitted allegations of gross misconduct.

A misconduct hearing in Bridgend considered allegations relating to the conduct of PC Tasia Stephens, who was based in the force's Mid Glamorgan division.

The officer faced allegations that she breached standards of professional behaviour in April last year by breaching Welsh Government lockdown restrictions by attending a family house party. On the same evening she failed a breath test after being involved in a road traffic collision and subsequently pleaded guilty to drink-driving at court.

The officer appeared before an independent panel, consisting of a legally qualified chair, a police Superintendent and an independent member.

The officer admitted that her actions amounted to gross misconduct. She was dismissed from the role with immediate effect.

Chief Superintendent Danny Richards of the South Wales Police professional standards department said:

"PC Stephens's behaviour fell well below the standards expected of all police officers and as a result she has lost her career.

"She has abused the trust and confidence which the public of South Wales placed in her to uphold the law, particularly at the most difficult time for everyone in trying to abide by Coronavirus regulations."
