Police are appealing for witnesses or relevant dash cam footage after a van was destroyed in an arson attack in Sidmouth.

The white Ford Transit van was deliberately set alight in a layby on the A3052 at The Bowd, just prior to the Tipton St John junction.

The vehicle was completely destroyed by fire during the attack which happened between 2.45pm and 3.10pm on Friday 18 December.

Police are treating the incident as arson and asking for any witnesses to contact them. They are particularly keen to hear from anyone with CCTV or dash cam footage which may have captured the fire or anyone on foot nearby at the time.

Please contact 101@dc.police.uk or telephone 101, quoting crime reference CR/106705/20.

Information can also be passed anonymously to independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org
