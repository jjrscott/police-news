Extensive, multi-agency building assessment work is continuing this morning within the 400-metre cordon of the WW2 bomb detonation site on Glenthorne Road, Exeter.

Every effort is being made to ensure the timely conclusion of the assessments in the hope some evacuated residents may be able to return home this evening.

However, evacuated residents are advised to work on a worst-case scenario basis, that they will not be able to return home this evening.

The council has confirmed that those already in hotel accommodation will be able to stay in their hotels tonight if necessary.

The council helpline is open until 5pm today for any evacuated residents needing support or advice: 0345 155 1015.

We are expecting to be able to issue an update with some clarity at around 3pm.

## Structural assessments being carried out this morning

Structural assessments of surrounding buildings have resumed this morning, Sunday 28 February, following the detonation of a suspected World War Two bomb on Glenthorne Road, Exeter, yesterday evening.

Police and partner agencies, including Devon County Council and Exeter City Council and various utility companies, are working hard in the hope evacuated residents will be able to return home today.

Residents should not return to their homes until further notice.

The council helpline closed at midnight last night and will re-open at 9am until 5pm today for any evacuated residents needing support or advice: 0345 155 1015.

The council has specified that the helpline is for residents who need help and support, and advisors will not be able to give information about damage to specific properties.

The controlled detonation of the device, believed to be a 1,000kg ‘Hermann bomb’ used by the Nazis in the Second World War, took place at 6.10pm yesterday evening, Saturday 27 February.

All 2,600 properties, including around 1,400 students from Exeter University halls of residences, within a 400-metre cordon, had been evacuated earlier in the day.

Extensive work to mitigate the impact of the blast, including the laying of 400-tonnes of sand, the building of walls and the digging of trenches, was implemented by Royal Navy and Army bomb disposal experts.

However, unfortunately structural damage has been caused to some buildings, primarily within the 100-metre cordon, including blown-out windows and cracks in brickwork.

Every effort is being made this morning to ensure structural assessments are conducted as soon as possible so that residents can return home later today.

Updates will be published throughout the day.
