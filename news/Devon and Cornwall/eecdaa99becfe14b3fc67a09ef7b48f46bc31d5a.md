A man and a woman from Devon have been charged following a multi-agency people smuggling operation near Teignmouth on Monday 14 December.

James Wisbey, 54, from West Hoe in Plymouth, and Fay Miles, 38, of no fixed abode, Devon, have been charged with conspiracy to do an act to facilitate the commission of a breach of UK immigration law by a non-EU person.

They are both due to appear at Plymouth Magistrates Court today, Wednesday 16 December.

The eight passengers on the boat have been arrested on suspicion of immigration offences and are in police custody.

The man arrested in Essex as part of the same investigation remains released under investigation.
