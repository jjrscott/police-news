A 60-year-old man has been charged with an alleged offence related to the Hunting Act following an investigation by Devon and Cornwall Police into online webinars held in August 2020.

Mark Hankinson, of Sherborne in Dorset, is due to appear before Plymouth Magistratesâ€™ Court on 4 March.

He is charged with intentionally encouraging or assisting others to commit an offence under the Hunting Act 2004, contrary to Section 44 of the Serious Crimes Act 2007.

An investigation was launched after the content of webinars on the theme of hunting, held on 11 and 13 August 2020, was brought to the attention of police.

Devon and Cornwall Police has led the investigation on behalf of all UK forces.

The charge relates to a webinar held on 11 August 2020.

We remind the public that, with court proceedings due to begin in March, this is a live and active case and we ask people not to speculate on social media.
