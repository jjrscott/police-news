Police are appealing for witnesses of a serious collision between a pedestrian and a car in Paignton this morning, Tuesday 2 March.

The incident occurred on Foxhole Road at around 11.40am.

Any witnesses to the collision who havenâ€™t already spoken to officers at the scene are asked to contact police. In addition, police would be particularly interested in anyone who may have dashcam footage of the collision and anyone who was in the vicinity at the time and may have seen the car prior to, or after, the collision.

Police would like to thank the members of public for their patience while an investigation of the scene was conducted.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police on 101 or via email at 101@dc.police.uk quoting log 313, 2/3/21.
