Police have completed their enquiries following reports of Protection of Badgers Act offences in St Ives.

PC Chris Collins, Rural Crime officer for Cornwall, said: “Officers attended the site under development at Carbis Bay Hotel on 18 March 2021.

"We were accompanied by the Cornwall Council county ecologist and a representative from the Cornwall Badger Group with the permission of the landowner.

“A previous ecological survey dated 2015 indicated the presence of a badger sett at the site but this sett was removed at that time under licence from Natural England using the correct methods.”

Officers and partners discovered evidence of badgers in the locality but no evidence of badger setts or activity on the ground under development could be found.

No wildlife crime offences have been identified in relation to these allegations.
