Police were called at 9.55pm on Thursday 18 February to an address on Shelley Way following concerns for the welfare of a man.

Ambulance treated the man, aged in his 70s, at the scene and he was taken to Derriford Hospital. He was confirmed deceased in the early hours on Friday 19 February and his next-of-kin have been informed.

A 50-year-old man from Plymouth was arrested on suspicion of murder and has since been related on police bail until 18 March.

A police cordon was in place over the weekend whilst enquiries were ongoing but officers have now released the scene.
