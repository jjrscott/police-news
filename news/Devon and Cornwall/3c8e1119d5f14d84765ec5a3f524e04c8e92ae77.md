Two schoolboys aged 14 and 15 from Greater Manchester are assisting police in connection with their enquiries into a series of bomb hoaxes that were made to schools in Barnstaple in November.

Warrants were executed by Greater Manchester Police in connection with the threats on Friday 11December, following a joint investigation by Devon & Cornwall Police and Greater Manchester Police. Enquiries are continuing.

Hoax calls were made to The Park Community College and Pilton Community College as well as three schools in Leigh, Greater Manchester and Warrington, Cheshire.

Detective Inspector Praveen Naidoo from Devon and Cornwall Police, said: “Police worked closely with the schools to provide reassurance and I would like to thank Greater Manchester Police for the work they have undertaken to progress this investigation.”

Detective Inspector John Davies from Greater Manchester Police, added: “These hoax calls caused considerable disruption to the schools involved, with both staff and children being evacuated. Our enquiries continue and I would like to thank the schools involved for their support.”
