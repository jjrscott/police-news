Police are appealing for witnesses of an incident involving a male driver pushing a female driver on Ottery Lane, between Feniton and Payhembury, East Devon, on Saturday 5 December.

The incident occurred between 4pm and 4.30pm.

PC Beth Kendrick, said: “We are investigating an incident which started with a man getting out of his blue 4x4 style vehicle and woman getting out of her red Mini Cooper, after meeting in the narrow part of the road.

“The male subsequently became aggressive and pushed the woman, who is in her 20s, multiple times to her chest area, causing her to stumble back.

“It is understood that there were a number of cars which had lined up behind their vehicles and we would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the assault or was driving along the road at that time and has dashcam footage which may have picked up the identity of the offender.

“The female has expressed her thanks to the people who stopped and checked on her welfare after the incident.”

Anyone with any information which could assist the investigation is asked to contact police on 101 or via email at 101@dc.police.uk quoting crime reference, CR/102077/20.
