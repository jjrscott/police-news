At approximately 2am on Sunday 10 January, a single-vehicle collision occurred outside Torre Railway Station on the A3022 in Torquay.

As a result of the collision, the two occupants of the vehicle, both 34-year-old males from the South Hams and Newton Abbot area, sustained serious injuries and were conveyed to Derriford Hospital for treatment.

Local officers, as well as officers from the Roads Policing Team, attended and a forensic examination of the scene was conducted.

Officers are seeking any witnesses and/or dashcam footage of the collision.

Anyone who witnessed a Ford Focus driving in the area at the time is also asked to call 101, or email 101@dc.police.uk, quoting log 75 of 10 January.

Once a full examination of the scene was conducted the road was reopened.

Officers would also like to thank the public for their patience whilst the road was closed.
