Police are appealing for a vital witness to come forward to assist them with enquiries into an alleged sexual assault.

They are asking for a female driver who was travelling along the A684 towards Leyburn, between 9.25am and 11.15am on Monday 14th Sept 2015 to contact them, as she may have important information that could assist the enquiry.

The female driver is described as white, in her twenties with long blonde hair. She was wearing red and white clothing and high heel shoes. She was travelling with a young child in the front passenger seat of the car. The car is described as a dark blue, medium sized vehicle.

About half a mile along the A684, after the left turning at Sinks Lane towards Crakehall, the female driver stopped to assist a young woman who was wearing beige leggings, an orange jumper and a green jacket.

Police are asking the driver to contact North Yorkshire Police by dialling 101 and selecting option 2 and ask to speak to DC Helen Mackie or DC Karen Barugh.
