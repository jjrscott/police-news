North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a fatal road traffic collision in Harrogate.

The incident, which involved a silver Kia Picanto car driven by a 40-year-old woman from the Knaresborough area and an 82-year-old woman pedestrian from the Harrogate area, occurred at the exit to the Odeon Cinema on Station Avenue just after 10am on Monday 9 March 2015.

Sadly, the elderly woman sustained serious injuries and died after being taken to Leeds General Infirmary.

We are not in a position to formally name the woman at this time.

Witnesses to the collision or anyone who noticed the car or pedestrian immediately prior to the collision, should contact North Yorkshire police on 101, select option 2, and ask for the Major Collision Investigation Team. Or email Mcit@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

Please quote incident number 12150038748 when providing information about this incident.
