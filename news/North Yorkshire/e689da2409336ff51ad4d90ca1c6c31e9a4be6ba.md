A 16-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of assaulting a police officer and possessing a knife in York.

The incident occurred on Peter Lane, near Spurriergate House, at around 9.45pm on Friday (2 October 2020).

Officers approached a group of teenage boys who they believed were acting drunk and disorderly.

A 16-year-old boy allegedly would not co-operate with the police and was arrested. It is alleged he head-butted an officer in the face while being placed in handcuffs.

The officer and his colleagues had to use proportionate and legitimate force to detain the suspect.

He was arrested for assaulting an emergency worker and also for possession of a knife in a public place.

Following questioning in custody, he was released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Another 16-year-old boy was arrested for assaulting an emergency worker after he allegedly tried to intervene in the first arrest. He has been released under investigation.

A 14-year-old boy and a further 16-year-old boy were also arrested in connection with the incident. They ran from the scene and were located at the Castle Car Park with assistance from City of York Councilâ€™s CCTV operators. They were later released without charge.

A dispersal order was issued for the remainder of the group to move away from the city centre.

Witnesses or anyone with information about the incident are asked to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 1, and speak to the Force Control Room.
