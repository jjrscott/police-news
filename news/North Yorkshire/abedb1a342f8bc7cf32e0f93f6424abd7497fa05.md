Police in Richmondshire have praised the actions of a member of the public for their vigilance that led to the arrest and charge of driver who blew nearly four times the legal drink drive limit during a roadside breath test.

On the night of Sunday 1 April 2018, at around 5.40pm, the member of the public rang the police when they became concerned for road users’ safety after witnessing the way a vehicle was driving along the A66 from the direction of Bowes Castle towards Scotch Corner.

The incident was transferred from Durham Police to North Yorkshire Police as the vehicle crossed the county border. The vehicle was then intercepted by North Yorkshire Police at Scotch Corner services where the driver, a 44-year-old man from Dumbarton near Glasgow, took a roadside breath test and was arrested after blowing 138 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35 micrograms. A second test taken at a police station, revealed a higher reading of 147 micrograms.

The man was subsequently charged with drink driving and is due to appear at Northallerton Magistrates’ Court on 17 April 2018. He was given bail conditions stipulating that he must not drive a motor vehicle on a public road.
