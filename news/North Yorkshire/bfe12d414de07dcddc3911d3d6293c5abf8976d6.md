Police have released a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to regarding the suspected fraudulent refund of wine from the Aldi store on Water Lane, York.

The man claimed that he purchased ten bottles of wine and required a refund for the purchase. The refund of Â£79.90 was authorised and the man left the store.

However, CCTV footage shows the man entering the store without any bottles and captures him allegedly removing the bottles from the shelf and request a fraudulent refund, when no purchase had actually been made.

Police are asking anyone who recognises the man to contact them on 101, select option one and pass the information on to the Force Control Room. Please quote reference 12180041581.

Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800555111.
