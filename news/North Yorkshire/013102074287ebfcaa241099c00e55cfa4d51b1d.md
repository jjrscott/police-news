North Yorkshire Police has released a film which shows how quickly and easily they can detect and arrest a person for drink or drug driving.

North Yorkshire Police has today released a film which shows how quickly and easily they can detect and arrest a person for drink or drug driving.

In an effort to deter people from putting their lives at risk this Christmas, the film depicts a person being stopped by a traffic officer for their manner of driving and being breathalysed and drug wiped.

Whilst being breathalysed is a known and understood process, North Yorkshire Police are keen to display how effectively they can detect drugs through a quick and painless saliva test, that can be carried out in under 10 minutes.

TC Andy Ingram, who appears in the film said:

'The film depicts how we can use these simple straight forward tools to detect if a person has been drink or drug driving so we can get them off the road. In under 10 minutes we can receive a positive result and place someone under arrest.'

'The message is clear this Christmas if you choose to drink or take drugs and get behind the wheel - the likelihood is you'll be arrested.'
