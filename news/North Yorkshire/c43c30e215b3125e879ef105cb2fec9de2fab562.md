Officers in Whitby are appealing for information to help identify two men following a cash scam in Whitby.

Officers want to speak to the men in the CCTV image in connection with the incident, which happened at the Boyes Store in Whitby.

Shortly after 3pm on 11 November 2017, two men entered the store on Station Square, Whitby. They proceeded to the till and distracted the cashier, confusing them in order to fraudulently take cash from the store. The men left with £75 in cash.

This tactic by thieves is called “ringing the changes” and involves the fraudsters exchanging notes with the cashier, intentionally confusing them to hand over extra cash.

Anyone who recognises the men in the CCTV image is asked to contact police. Dial 101, press 2 and ask to speak to PC Lewis Cadden.

Please quote reference number 12170203460 when passing on any information.
