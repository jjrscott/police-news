Following a police investigation in North Yorkshire, three men have appeared in court for sentencing for burglary offences. All three were sentenced to 21 months in jail for the offences.

Aaron Calladine, 20, Jordan Woodhouse, 24 and Bradley Stevenson,22, all from Rotherham, South Yorkshire appeared at Teesside Crown Court on 21 September 2017 where they all pleaded guilty to burglary.

Following the sentencing, Rob Davies, Wildlife Crime Officer and Rural Crime Officer of North Yorkshire Police’s Rural Taskforce said:

“These individual’s specifically targeted rural area’s to commit crime but due to our swift response and determined investigation that followed we were able to trace, arrest and successfully prosecute these cross border criminals leading to these convictions. It sends out a message to anybody who attempts to target and commit crime in rural areas of North Yorkshire that we will pursue, arrest and prosecute those responsible as a priority.”

The case relates to an incident in October 2016 at Red Shaw Farm in Hawes, where the farm was targeted and an attempt was made to steal the victim’s quad bikes. They also stole a chainsaw which was dumped and recovered.
