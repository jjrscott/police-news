Police have increased patrols and issued an efit of a man they would like to speak to, after a suspected incident of a sexual nature in Knaresborough.

Between 8am and 8.20am on Friday 9 September 2016, a 12-year-old girl was approached by a man in the area of Charlton Manor Drive as she walked to school. He lifted her rucksack off her back, from behind. The girl challenged the man, and he walked off. There was no direct contact between the suspect and the victim, but it is believed the incident may have been sexually motivated.

Officers have increased foot patrols in the area, particularly around school times, and are urging people to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the police.

PC Simon Davis, of Knaresborough Police, said: “This is a concerning incident, and although the girl was not injured, she was understandably upset. Parents can be reassured that we have increased patrols in the area, and a full police investigation is underway to identify the man involved and establish the circumstances behind this incident.”

The suspect is described as aged in his 40s or 50s, well-built, with dark hair, bald on top.

Anyone who recognises the man in the efit, or who has any information about the incident, is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police by calling 101. Please select option 2 and ask for PC Simon Davis or Knaresborough Police. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Please quote reference number 12160164127 when passing information.
