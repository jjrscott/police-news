Police are appealing for information after a Ford Mondeo left the road between Low Row and Gunnerside near Richmond.

It happened at around 11am on Thursday 28 December 2017. On Arrival officers found the vehicle had come to rest approximately 50 metres from the road in a field.

The driver, a man aged in his 30s from the Darlington area, suffered serious injuries and was airlifted to James Cook Hospital in Middlesbrough where he remains in a critical condition. The passenger in the car, a 17- year-old boy, also from the Darlington area, sustained less serious injuries and was taken to Darlington Memorial Hospital.

The B6270 between Low Row and Gunnerside was closed for approximately five hours to allow emergency services to attend to the casualties and while investigators examined the scene of the collision.
