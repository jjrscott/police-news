Police are appealing for information after rubbish was fly-tipped and set on fire on moorland in rural Richmondshire.

Sometime in the early hours of 4 May 2020, a large amount of rubbish was dumped into a sink hole, in a remote location between Hurst Moor Road and Cordilleras Lane. The rubbish was then set on fire.

Officers have warned that those reckless actions could have resulted in an extremely serious fire on the dry moorland.

PC Mark Wood, Richmond Rural beat manager, said: "There is a high risk of moorland fires at the moment, and the consequences of this could have been incredibly serious."

The fly-tipped rubbish included remnants of a mattress, some crutches, empty cardboard packs of icing sugar, an artificial Christmas tree and garden waste.

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, quoting reference number 12200074322.

North Yorkshire Police officers are working closely with colleagues at Richmondshire District Council to identify those responsible for fly-tipping offences.
