Five people have been arrested in Scarborough on suspicion of supplying Class A drugs.

Just before 9pm on Monday 18 May 2020, police officers on Seamer Road became aware of a disturbance outside a property nearby.

They attended and spoke to a group of people. Two were detained for a search under the Misuse of Drugs Act, and subsequently arrested.

A 35-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs, and possession with intent to supply Class A drugs. A 45-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs and possession of cannabis.

Officers then attended a property in the Castle Road area of Scarborough a short time later.

There, they forced entry to a flat, and arrested two men â€“ a 29-year-old man on suspicion of affray and possession with intent to supply Class A drugs, and a 21-year-old man on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs and possession with intent to supply Class A drugs.

A large amount of suspected crack cocaine and heroin was found in the property and seized.

On the afternoon of Tuesday 19 May, a fifth person, a 37-year-old man, was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs, in connection with the same incident.

All five detainees have been released on bail while enquiries continue.
