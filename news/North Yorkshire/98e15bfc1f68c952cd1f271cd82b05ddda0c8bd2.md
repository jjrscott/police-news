North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a burglary of a home in Hunsingore.

It happened in between 10am and 3.30pm on Saturday, 10 March 2018.

Two watches were stolen and are still outstanding. These are a Breitling Watch with a white face and silver strap and a Tag Heuer 2000 series executive watch with a cream / pear coloured face and silver strap. Both of these were gifts which hold a sentimental value to the family.
