A community meeting will be held in Kirby Misperton to give people the opportunity to discuss policing issues connected to hydraulic fracturing operations in the area.

The meeting, which is open to everyone, will take place on Tuesday 5 September, from 5.30pm, in the Village Hall in Kirby Misperton.

Superintendent Dave Hannan, from North Yorkshire Police, and a community representative will be available to answer questions. The meeting will be chaired by Tom Knox from North Yorkshire County Council.

Supt Hannan said: “We have been working very closely with the community of Kirby Misperton. We understand that protest activity connected to hydraulic fracturing is likely to have an impact on the local community, and I’d like to reassure residents that we are doing all we can to reduce that impact.

“Local neighbourhood police officers and PCSOs will continue to be active in the area, discussing our role and addressing any concerns. This meeting is a further chance for us to hear directly from the community, so I would urge people to come along to raise any issues or queries they may have.”
