North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a burglary that occurred at Fulford in York.

It happened at Fordlands Crescent between 10.30am and midnight on 28 November 2019. The offenders have gained entry to a house by forcing the rear door open causing significant damage to the door and frame.

A very untidy search of the property was conducted resulting in more than £6,000 of cash and property being stolen.

In addition to cash the following items were stolen: 3 Michael Kors handbags, an Italian leather jacket, two TAG Heuer wristwatches and an assortment of 22ct gold chains and rings from Thailand.

At this time we do not have any confirmed suspects. We are requesting the public’s assistance to help establish further lines of enquiry surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for witnesses in the area at the time, or anyone who may have information with regards the stolen property. We believe the offender/s travelled via the A19 and used the grassy area between the back of Fordlands Crescent and the A19 to enter and leave the area.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Kristoffer Griffiths. You can also email kristoffer.griffiths@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk.

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12190218774.
