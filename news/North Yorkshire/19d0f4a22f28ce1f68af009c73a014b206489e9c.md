Assistant Chief Constable Paul Kennedy said:

"The positive inspection report is welcomed by North Yorkshire Police and reflects our proud position of overseeing the safest area in England.

"By achieving the 'good' rating from HMIC, which places the force among the best in England and Wales, we have clearly demonstrated our ability to prevent crime and anti-social behaviour, as well as keeping people safe and secure. This has been achieved through our unstinting commitment to neighbourhood policing, with local policing teams that are fully engaged with their communities and effective partnership work to resolve concerns and issues when they arise.

"North Yorkshire Police is also good at investigating crimes, managing dangerous offenders and tackling serious and organised crime. This is deserved recognition for our specialist investigation teams and the officers and staff who have responsibility for public protection.

"We acknowledge the feedback from HMIC regarding improving the service delivered to vulnerable people and supporting victims. This specifically relates to inconsistencies in service for cases assessed as lower risk, in comparison to those deemed to be high risk.

"However, as recently announced by Chief Constable Dave Jones and Julia Mulligan, the Police and Crime Commissioner, we are confident this will be addressed with the Â£3m investment to develop the Serious Crime Team and establish a new Non-recent Child Abuse Investigation Team and an Online Investigation team for child sexual exploitation. This will target those people who access indecent images of children, which is a critical step to protect vulnerable people."

A response from Julia Mulligan, Police and Crime Commissioner for North Yorkshire, is available from www.northyorkshire-pcc.gov.uk
