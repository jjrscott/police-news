Police are reminding firearms certificate holders about the importance of following national Coronavirus regulations.

Yesterday morning, North Yorkshire Police revoked the shotgun certificates of two men who were found to be shooting on land in a rural area near Ripon on the afternoon of Sunday 5 April 2020.

When officers attended, they established that the men were shooting on land where they did not have permission, and in breach of current Coronavirus guidance, as they were not shooting as part of their employment or at the request of the landowner.

Inspector Andrew Palmer, Head of Firearms Licensing at North Yorkshire Police, said: “I would like to reiterate the advice I have given certificate holders, which is if shooting is part of your work or employment, or it has been specifically requested by a landowner to protect their crops or livestock, then it is permitted.

“However, any other shooting that is not part of a business is not essential, and should not be carried out at this time.

“We will continue to review any breach on a case-by-case basis – so with that in mind, please follow the advice which is to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.”
