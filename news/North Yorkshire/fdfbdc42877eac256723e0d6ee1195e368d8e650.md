Members of the public are being asked to play their part to stop wildlife crime, by reporting illegal traps and snares.

The message comes following the conviction of a man for permitting the use of a pole trap at a farm in Cropton, near Pickering, on 11 June 2014.

Michael Wood, 69, of Sinnington, was found guilty of the offence at Scarborough Magistrates Court on 17 February. He was fined £4,000, and ordered to pay costs of £750 and a victim surcharge of £120.

PC Andy Marsden, a Wildlife Crime Officer at North Yorkshire Police, said: "This conviction sends out a strong message that North Yorkshire Police will take decisive action against people who commit wildlife crime.

"Despite the fact that wild birds are protected by law, birds are still persecuted and suffer cruel treatment. This is unacceptable, and we will not tolerate it in North Yorkshire.

"If members of the public see traps, please do not interfere with them, as they may be used in a legal manner. However, if there are concerns, photograph them in situ, get a GPS location if possible, and contact North Yorkshire Police so we can investigate."

North Yorkshire Police has a number of specialist wildlife crime officers.
