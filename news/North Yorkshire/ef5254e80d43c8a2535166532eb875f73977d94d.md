Police are appealing for information to help identify the woman in the CCTV image following a theft in Scarborough.

Officers want to speak to the woman in the CCTV in connection with the theft, which happened on Friday 15 December 2017 at the McColls store on Westwood, Scarborough.

At around 7.30am, the victim, a 74 year old woman was using the ATM, but there appeared to be a fault with the machine. The woman behind the victim was heard to have said “I’m going to be late for work”. The 74 year old victim then panicked and left the ATM, believing it had not worked.

It had in fact worked and the £250 worth of cash was dispensed as she walked away from the ATM.

The woman behind the victim then went to use the ATM machine. She saw the victim’s cash and took it and immediately left the store. She made no attempt to give the money back to the victim - who was still in the shop buying milk.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police. Dial 101, press 2 and ask to speak to PC Zac Waterman or email zac.waterman@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Please quote reference number 12170223515 when passing on any information.
