Three men were arrested in Harrogate yesterday (15 September) after plain clothed officers intercepted a suspected drugs deal.

Officers from North Yorkshire Police’s Operation Expedite team were on proactive patrols in the Montpellier Hill area when they saw what they believed was a drug deal taking place.

After stopping and searching three men, they recovered a large amount of suspected heroin and cash. The three men, all from Harrogate and aged 37 and two aged 45, were arrested on suspicion of possessing class A drugs with intent to supply. One 45-year-old was also arrested on suspicion of possessing criminal property (money).

In the region of 30 wraps of suspected heroin, £600 cash and a number of mobile phones and scales have been seized as part of the investigation.

Seized as part of the investigation

Police have issued an appeal after a member of the public assisted police officers at the scene by pointing out discarded, suspected drugs.

If you believe that’s you, officers urge you to please contact then on 101 and ask for Harrogate CID. Or pass information to the Force Control Room for incident number 12200161830.

All three suspects have been released while under investigation.

Detective Constable Tom Barker who works on the force’s Operation Expedite team, said: “We continue to focus our efforts on the disruption of County Lines drugs gangs, focusing on safeguarding those most vulnerable in society and making life difficult for the criminals who choose to exploit them. Today’s action is one example of the relentless work going on to target drugs and the misery it brings to our communities. We urge anyone with any information about drug dealing to contact the police or Crimestoppers anonymously. We will take action.”

Please report anything you suspect may be linked to the exploitation of children, and drug dealing. No matter how small you might think it is, please report it as every little piece of information helps us piece together a bigger picture.
