North Yorkshire Police volunteers supported an operation to tackle speeding vehicles on Richmond's roads.

Volunteer Police Cadets and Special Constables gave up their own time to help support Richmondshire Neighbourhood Policing Team on Saturday 31 October 2020.

The team deployed to Darlington Road in Richmond, responding to concerns from local residents.

PC Ross Moralee said: "There are often reports from residents and pupils about speeding on that road, so this was an opportunity to help us tackle the issue. On the day we spoke to several motorists and gave them words of advice in relation to speeding. One driver was also reported for having no MOT."

Residents can report concerns about speeding in their area through our speed management protocol.
