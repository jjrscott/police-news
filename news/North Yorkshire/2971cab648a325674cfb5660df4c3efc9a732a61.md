As part of this year’s Volunteers’ Week (1 to 7 June 2017) North Yorkshire Police are showing their appreciation of their own volunteers by supporting York Cares’ Big Community Challenge.

The force has around 160 Police Support Volunteers, 130 Special Constables (volunteer police officers) and 43 Volunteer Police Cadets who provide thousands of hours each year to support the work of North Yorkshire Police and help keep its local communities safe.

This year the force wanted to demonstrate its thanks to them and turn the tables by volunteering to help improve life for local people.

On Monday 5 June 2017, a team of 10 officers and staff from the York area will volunteer their time to help transform the grounds of Tang Hall Community Centre to help create a community hub where people can garden, grown food, socialise and celebrate together. The challenge is led by York Cares – an independent employee volunteering charity who bring businesses, employees and communities together.

Natasha Almond, Citizens in Policing Coordinator Manager, said: “As a way of saying thank you to our volunteers who come from all sections of our local community, we want to give something back that will make a tangible difference and acknowledge the dedication and commitment of the remarkable people who make up our Citizens in Policing. My thanks go to everyone who is taking part in the Big Community Challenge, and to our volunteers, specials, cadets and the wider community groups and organisations who contribute to policing in North Yorkshire, they really do make a difference.”

Caroline Wilcock Volunteering Project Officer at York Cares said "We are delighted that North Yorkshire Police are taking part in this year's challenge. They will be joining over 150 volunteers from local businesses and the community who are all preparing to get stuck in together and create a fantastic outdoor space for the Tang Hall community."
