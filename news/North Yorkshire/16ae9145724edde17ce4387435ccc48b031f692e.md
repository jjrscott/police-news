We expected the Tweetathon to be of interest to many people, however, the response, support and feedback from members of the public has exceeded all of our expectations.

Our aim was to give an insight, as best we could, into a day in the life of frontline officers and staff. The tweets have provided a mere glimpse of the tip of the iceberg of policing, including the challenges, the emotion, the darker, and the lighter side of the job.

There was a real variety of incidents called in over the period but believe it or not, that was a fairly steady 24 hours compared to some. And while the live tweets have come to end and normal Twitter service has resumed, the calls continue 24 hours a day, 365 days a week.

Why did we do it? A number of reasons, Twitter is now an important communications channel to warn and inform members of the public in times of crisis, to assist investigations, and to engage with, or simply inform people of what we do. It’s also free to use.

Tweetathons have been held in the past by numerous forces, including North Yorkshire Police, and have really helped to inform people about our work. Demand is increasing and changing, and we believed that now was the right time hold another one, to help explain what is a police matter and what isn’t, how some incidents will take priority over others and to signpost people to advice if they are experiencing a similar situation.

We are an accountable public service and it’s important that members of the public have an insight - within operational and legal boundaries – into what we do. Our thanks go to everyone who followed and provided very kind and supportive feedback. It’s really appreciated by our hard working officers, staff and volunteers.
