Quick thinking work from officers involved led to arrest.

Wade Kershaw

19 year-old Wade Kershaw was today sentenced at York Crown Court to 18 months in prison after pleading guilty to shop robbery.

On 9 May 2019, Kershaw entered the BNT store on Nunthorpe Road, York and threatened a shop assistant with a knife, demanding they hand over money from the till.

Kershaw grabbed the victim’s arm and jumped onto the counter before stealing a bottle of gin and exiting the shop. Quick-thinking North Yorkshire Police officers seized the victim’s jacket which was later found to hold traces of Kershaw’s DNA from when he’d grabbed their arm during the incident.

Shop CCTV captured the incident and Kershaw was observed by members of the public leaving the scene whilst carrying the bottle of gin he had stolen. Kershaw was then observed by local police in the area near the shop later that evening and was arrested on suspicion of robbery.

Kershaw is currently serving a four year sentence at HMP Hull for blackmail and assault offences committed shortly after the shop robbery and was today sentenced to an additional 18 months in prison.
