One of the four occupants in the Seat was flown to Leeds General Infirmary by the air ambulance with serious non-life threatening injuries. The female driver was also taken to Leeds General Infirmary by land ambulance with serious non-life threatening injuries.

The HGV driver was uninjured in the collision.
