A police safety campaign which asks people to think carefully about the effects of their drinking has been shortlisted for a national award.

North Yorkshire Police's Alternate campaign aims to tackle the negative impacts of excessive alcohol consumption, with a series of hard-hitting videos highlighting the risks of drinking too much.

Announced today, Alternate has been shortlisted in the "Best use of video" and "Social marketing campaign of the year" categories at the UK Public Sector Communications Awards 2016.

The awards celebrate "excellent communication strategies and campaigns, teams and individuals in local and national government, emergency services and not-for-profit bodies from across the UK". The winning entries will be announced on Thursday 14 July 2016 at a ceremony in London.

North Yorkshire Police have been shortlisted alongside campaigns by Arts Council England and HM Revenue and Customs. The full shortlist is available athttp://www.publicsectorcommunicationsawards.co.uk/shortlist

The five Alternate films were premi√®red in Selby in September 2015, shown on a large video van at the town's Market Cross. Posters and credit-card sized 'app cards' featuring links to web content were distributed at licensed premises across the town. All the films are also available to watch on North Yorkshire Police's YouTube channel viahttp://tinyurl.com/alternatevid. Messages are regularly posted on social media, including Twitter with the hashtag #AlternateDrinking.

The campaign was supported by research undertaken by York St John University, which obtained detailed information to assess people's drinking patterns, allowing police to target advice to those most likely to drink excessively. The study can be viewed athttp://www.yorksj.ac.uk/news--events/news--events-home/news/selby-alcohol-survey.aspx

The Alternate campaign was also shortlisted in the "Best use of video" category at the comms2point0 awards in 2015.

Inspector Ian Mcniff, of Selby Police, who led the campaign, said: "It's excellent to see North Yorkshire Police's pioneering work recognised at a national level once again. The Alternate campaign continues to receive very positive feedback from people all across North Yorkshire.

"The campaign is backed by research, but ultimately its message is simple: a night out with friends can be fun, and we don't want to stop that. We are simply asking you to be aware of how much you drink and how it will affect you. Thinking differently about your drinking will ensure you enjoy yourself and stay safe."
