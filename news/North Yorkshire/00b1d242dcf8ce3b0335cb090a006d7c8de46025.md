Two people have been arrested on suspicion of drugs offences in Easingwold.

On the morning of Wednesday 9 September 2020, two warrants under the Misuse of Drugs Act were executed. Acting on information received, North Yorkshire Police officers attended two properties in the town, and seized a quantity of suspected drugs.

Police have thanked members of the public for their support, and urged them to get in touch with information about suspected drugs offences.

A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a class B drug, possession of a class A drug, and drug driving.

A 62-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a class B drug.

Both suspects have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: “We will continue to be proactive when information is received about the supply of illegal drugs. That’s why we’re appealing to the community in the Easingwold area – and right across North Yorkshire – to report any suspicious activity either via 101 or anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
