Police are appealing for information after a number of kittiwakes were shot in Scarborough harbour.

Some time between 21 - 24 July 2015, around eight Kittiwake chicks have been shot and killed whilst nesting on the harbour walls at Scarborough. Enquiries are ongoing. Kittiwakes are a protected species and police are very keen to find out who is responsible for these attacks.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101, select option 2 and quote reference 12150126077.
