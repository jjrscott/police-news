Police in Selby are appealing for the driver of a Range Rover car travelling along Gowthorpe in Selby between 7.10pm and 7.40pm on 23 July to come forward.

The driver and anyone else with information that could assist the investigation should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Pc 387 Boyle. You can also email kylie.boyle@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
