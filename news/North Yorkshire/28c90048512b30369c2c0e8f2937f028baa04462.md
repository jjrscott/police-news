Police are asking for the public’s help to identify the man shown in a CCTV image in connection with a fraud investigation.

At 9.55am on Tuesday 16 May 2017, two mobile phones were collected and signed for by a man who used a fake signature, a false driving licence and utility bills in the name of the victim as proof of identity.

On Friday 28 July 2017 the victim received a letter in the post from Sky Mobile stating that his sky mobile account was overdue and that he owed £70. As he did not have a Sky Mobile account he believed it was a genuine mistake and ignored the letter.

On Sunday 27 August 2017 the victim received a further letter in the post from Sky Mobile stating that they had still not received any payment for the overdue bill which now totalled £350.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the public’s assistance to help determine the identity the man who was caught on CCTV.

Anyone who recognises him or has any information is asked to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for Oliver Lewis or email Oliver.Lewis592@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote reference 12170163445 when passing on information.
