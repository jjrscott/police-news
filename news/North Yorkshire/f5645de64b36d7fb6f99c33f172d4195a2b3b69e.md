North Yorkshire remains the lowest crime area in England and Wales despite a 9% rise in recorded offences.

This was confirmed in the Office of National Statistics’ (ONS) "Crime in England and Wales, year ending June 2018" bulletin, published today (Thursday 18 October 2019).

It shows there were a total of **40,782** crimes in North Yorkshire during the 12-month period, giving a crime rate of **49.7** per 1,000 of the population.

This **9%** local increase is below the national average crime increase of **10** %.

Broken down into the main crime categories, the ONS figures for North Yorkshire show:

 * Burglary decreased by **1** % ( **3,658** crimes in total, of which **2,235** are recorded as domestic burglaries and **1,423** non-domestic burglaries)
 * Drug offences increased by **6** % ( **1,592** crimes in total)
 * Violence and against the person increased by **20** % ( **11,811** crimes in total), which is broken down into Violence with Injury ( **5,112** crimes in total, a **10** % increase); Violence without Injury category ( **4,821** crimes in total, a **22** % increase); Harassment and Stalking ( **1,849** crimes in total, a **47** % increase)
 * Possession of weapons offences up by **22** % ( **247** crimes in total)
 * Robbery increased by **14** % ( **183** crimes in total)

 * All other theft offences up by **2** % ( **4,466** crimes in total)
 * Criminal damage and arson up by **3** % ( **5,934** crimes in total)
 * Vehicle Offences were up **15%** with **2,473** crimes in total
 * Sexual offences increased by **13** % ( **1,649** crimes in total). As previously highlighted, this rise is regarded as a reflection of the confidence victims have in North Yorkshire Police, particularly those making historical complaints in the wake of high profile historical sexual abuse cases, plus support from dedicated facilities for victims of sexual assault
 * Public order offences up by **18** % ( **1,774** crimes in total)
 * Miscellaneous crimes against society, which includes the possession and publication of extreme sexual images, fell by **2** % with **743** crimes in total

The county’s overall crime rate of 49.7 per 1,000 of the population is the lowest nationally, and is significantly lower than the average of 84.7 per 1,000 across England and Wales.

Chief Constable Lisa Winward said: “Today’s figures show North Yorkshire remains the lowest crime area in England and Wales. There has been an increase in recorded offences, but this is also slightly lower than the national average.

“Here in North Yorkshire we’ve been looking closely at how we record crime and have recently introduced a range of new measures to ensure we are detecting and investigating offences more effectively. This work is ongoing, and while it will naturally influence the county’s crime levels, it is the right thing to do to ensure victims continue to feel confident about reporting offences to us.”
