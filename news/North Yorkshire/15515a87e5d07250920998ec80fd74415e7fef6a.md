Police are appealing for information following an aggravated burglary in York.

At around 7.38pm on Saturday 17 October, police received a report of a burglary at a house on Broadway after a family had returned to their home to find three suspects had broken into their house while they were out.

The suspects were bravely challenged by the householder who tried to stop them from running off. However, they got away after hitting the man with an unknown blunt object. Itâ€™s believed they left the scene in a dark coloured saloon car, parked on Broadway that drove off towards the University of York.

It is also believed that one of the suspects was carrying a knife. They left with a quantity of Asian gold jewellery including some of high sentimental value, and a quantity of cash.

Officers are carrying out extensive enquiries in the area including house-to-house enquiries and examining CCTV footage.

Anyone who can assist the investigation, including anyone in the area who has CCTV that may have captured the suspects or their car, is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101 and pass information for incident number 12200182533.

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
