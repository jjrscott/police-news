North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a distraction burglary, involving bogus officials that occurred in Scarborough.

The incident took place on the afternoon of Monday 2 May 2016 on Lowdale Avenue, Scarborough.

During the afternoon of Monday 2nd May 2016 an incident occurred whereby two men gained entry to an elderly man's home on Lowdale Avenue, Scarborough by claiming to be plain clothes CID police officers.

Once inside the property, one man distracted the occupier whilst the second stole property.

The men then left, advising that they would return an hour later to check on him, stating "DON'T CALL THE POLICE, WE WILL CALL YOU".

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the public's assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information from other residents who may have had similar calls at their homes.

North Yorkshire Police would also advise residents to always ask for identification from any callers claiming to be Police officers.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for Neale Graham. You can also email neale.graham@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12160076005.
