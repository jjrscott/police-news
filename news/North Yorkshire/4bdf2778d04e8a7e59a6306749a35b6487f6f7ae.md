North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about an incident involving a cyclist and a dark coloured Audi that occurred in York.

The incident happened at 8.10am on Tuesday 31 January 2017 and involved a female cyclist and a dark coloured Audi.

The driver of the Audi turned left into the junction of Avenue Terrace, Bootham, York whilst the cyclist was approaching the junction. Although no contact was made with the cyclist, the driverâ€™s actions meant the cyclist had to brake hard causing her to fall off and she suffered minor bruising as a result. The driver of the vehicle stopped at the time but drove off before details were obtained.

We are appealing for witnesses or anyone who recalls seeing the vehicle prior to the incident, to get in touch to assist the investigation.

In particular, we are appealing for information about the dark coloured Audi which could help us to establish the identity of the driver or the registration number for the vehicle.

If you can help, please contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for Amanda Popely. You can also email amanda.popely@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk.
