North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about an assault that occurred on Church Street, Malton around 8.30pm on Friday 21 August.

The victim, a 61 year old local man, was walking back to his home address when he was confronted by a group of around 8 youths, one of whom started shouting at him before pushing him in the chest knocking him to the floor.

The victim sustained a broken bone in his foot and dislocated his ankle, resulting in him spending three days in hospital.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the public's assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

We are particularly interested in speaking to members of the group with the man who were not involved in the assault.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact the police. Dial 101 and ask for Alan Robson, or emailalan.robson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
