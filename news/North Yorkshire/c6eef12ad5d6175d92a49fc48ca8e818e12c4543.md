Police investigating a fatal collision on the A19 near Osmotherley are appealing for dash-cam footage.

The incident occurred on the north-bound carriageway, just before the A172 turn-off to Stokesley, at around 7pm on Friday 22 June 2018.

It involved a white Citroen Dispatch van and red Kia Rio car.

It is believed the collision occurred when the van crossed over from lane two to lane one as the Kia that was travelling in lane one.

The Kia came to rest by a road-side tree.

The passenger in the Kia, a 76-year-old woman from Billingham, died on Monday (25 June 2018) at James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough. She had to be airlifted to hospital.

The driver of the Kia, a 40-year-old man from Stockton-on-Tees, escaped with minor injuries. He was also treated at the same hospital.

The driver of the van, a 58-year-old man from South Shields, was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving. He has been released under investigation while police enquiries continue.

Officers are appealing for witnesses and information to assist the investigation.

In particular, they are urging lorry drivers and other motorists who were on A19 between the A172 Stokesley and Osmotherley turn-offs on Friday evening, to check their dash-cams in case they have any footage that could help enquiries.

Please contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Hamish Halloway. Or email hamish.halloway@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk quoting reference number 12180111678.
