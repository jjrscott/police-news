“To remember those who were murdered for who they are. To stand against prejudice and hatred today”

Holocaust Memorial Day is a reminder of how hatred, prejudice and discrimination, if left unchallenged, can escalate and result in a terrible breakdown in humanity and decency which are manifested in genocide.

But even after the murder of six million Jews in Europe, genocides and persecution still take place around the world.

Over the past week, North Yorkshire Police has been reminding colleagues about the Holocaust and the constant requirement for us to challenge the scourge of prejudice, ignorance and hatred against people who are considered as “others”.

Today, we are holding a commemorative service (virtually) where we will be joined by members of the Jewish Community to hear how the legacy of the Holocaust still affects them today.

Our Headquarters will light up in purple at 5pm today, as we remember the incomprehensible suffering and remind ourselves to challenge prejudice and hate every day.

Don’t let your community be blighted by intolerance and hate - stand up and speak out for those who may not be able to.

You can report hate crime to North Yorkshire Police, either as a victim or for someone else, on 101 or 999. You can also contact Supporting Victims in North Yorkshire to report a hate crime, or TruVision – A National Reporting Hate Crime Centre.

If you feel that you are not ready to speak to the police or report the crime, there are other agencies you can contact to get support;

Community Safety Trust - a National Jewish reporting Centre for hate crime

Tell Mama – A National Muslim Reporting Centre https://tellmamauk.org/

Galop – A National LGBT reporting centre https://www.galop.org.uk/
