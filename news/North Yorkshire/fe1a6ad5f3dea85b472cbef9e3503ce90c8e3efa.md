North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses following an attempted murder in Selby.

At 2.36am on Sunday 5 August 2018 police responded to reports of a stabbing where a 21-year-old man had received injuries to his chest and a 20-year-old man had received injuries to his wrist outside the Square Bar in Selby.

Both men were taken to Leeds General Infirmary for treatment for their injuries. The 20-year-old man has since been released from hospital. The other man remains in hospital and is receiving treatment for his injuries which are not thought to be life threatening.

A 19 year-old man also received injuries to his shoulder and was admitted to York District Hospital for treatment but has since been discharged. A fourth man, 20 years-old, received superficial injuries which did not require hospital treatment. All four men are from Selby.

Three men, aged 18, 23 and 26 years of age, were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after the incident.

The 18 and 23 year old-men, who are from the West Midlands area, were arrested following a short pursuit, where the vehicle they were in, failed to stop. It was involved in a collision with an unrelated vehicle in the Glasshoughton area of West Yorkshire. They remain in custody in North Yorkshire for questioning.

The 26-year old man, who is local, has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and possession of a Class A drug. He has been released under investigation.

Detective Inspector Jackie Smart, of North Yorkshire Police’s Serious Crime Team in York said:

“In the early hours of Sunday morning four men in Selby received serious stab wounds requiring hospital treatment.

“Three arrests have been made in connection with this serious incident however our investigation is ongoing to establish the full circumstances surrounding what happened.

“We would urge anyone who witnessed any part of this altercation, or who has any information which could assist our investigation, to contact North Yorkshire Police.

“We’d also appeal to any taxi drivers or motorists who were in the area at the time who may have dash-cam footage, or members or the public with mobile phone footage, to share this vital information with us.

"This was an isolated incident and people in the local community are likely to notice an increased presence of police officers in the area while our enquiries continue.”

Anyone with any information about the incident should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101 and pass information to the Force Control Room quoting the reference 12180144039. You can also email SCTYork@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
