Six men from the West Yorkshire area have been reported for summons after being spotted near Selby.

At about 11pm on Friday 25 November, officers on patrol noticed a Mitsubishi Pajero and a Nissan X-Trail, and men with dogs, in suspicious circumstances on land near Balne.

Enquiries revealed neither vehicle was taxed, and both were seized. Two lamps were also seized. Six men were spoken to at the scene, and subsequently reported for summons for poaching offences.

This week, North Yorkshire Police launched its “Call it in” campaign, urging residents to note down and report any suspicious activity in remote or isolated areas. Particularly in rural parts of the county, local communities can act as the ‘eyes and ears’ of the police, allowing officers to respond to crime – including poaching and other wildlife offences – wherever it occurs.
