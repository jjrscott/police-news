North Yorkshire Police is warning York residents to be alert for any suspicious activity following a rise in daytime burglaries over recent weeks.

Property in Huntington was targeted yesterday (2 November 2020) by offenders driving a dark coloured Audi A4 which had been seen earlier appearing to scout out homes in Wigginton.

Police are particularly urging residents to ensure their properties are fully secured if leaving them vacant for any period of time and to report any suspicious activity such as unknown vehicles driving around neighbourhoods and individuals who may seem out of place.

A North Yorkshire Police spokesperson said:

“If something doesn’t look or seem right then we always advise you to call it in on 101. This sort of information is vital in helping us to prevent burglaries and most importantly, to help us keep you and your communities safe.

“Shorter days and dark nights present the perfect opportunity for criminals but by following our home security advice below and keeping your eyes open for anything suspicious we can make their lives much harder.”

**Top tips for home security:**

 * Lock your doors and windows every time you leave the house, even when you’re just out in the garden, remembering to double-lock UPVC doors (lift handle and turn key)
 * Hide all keys, including car keys, out of sight and away from the letterbox (remember a device could be used to hook keys through the letterbox)
 * Install a visual burglar alarm (as part of a suite of prevention measures – a burglar alarm on its own will not prevent entry to your home)
 * Consider installing CCTV to cover your property and put up a sign to declare that you have CCTV for your neighbours and potential intruders to see.
 * Install good outside lighting and make sure your security lights are in good working order
 * Get a trusted neighbour to keep an eye on your property
 * Leave radios or lights in your house on a timer to make the property appear occupied
 * Make sure the fences around your garden are in good condition, especially rear fencing
 * Secure bikes at home by locking them to an immoveable object inside a locked shed or garage
 * Keep ladders and tools stored away; don’t leave them outside where they could be used to break into your home
 * Ensure side gates are locked to prevent access to the rear of the property
 * Improve natural surveillance at the front of your property i.e. trim high hedges
 * Get your property marked and registered with our free dot peen property marking system
 * Consider joining or forming a Neighbourhood Watch scheme or a Mobile Rural Watch scheme
 * Remove valuables from view of ground floor windows
 * Store any high value items (i.e. jewellery, passports) in a properly secured safe or bank vault
