North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a robbery that occurred in a shop in Cross Hills near Skipton.

The incident happened in the Spar Shop on Main Street on Sunday 20 January 2019 between 8.30pm and 9pm when a suspect entered the shop and produced a knife with a red handle/blade before demanding a member of staff empty the till and hand the contents to him. No-one was injured in the incident .

The offender was wearing a dark jacket, dark trousers and white trainers. He was also wearing a woolly type hat which seems to have been rolled down into a balaclava prior to committing the offence. The offender made off on foot from the store with an amount of cash.

A member of the public walked passed the front door to the Spar Shop wearing a white/light coloured coat as the offender left the store shortly after 8.45pm.

We are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about the offender or anyone who saw someone matching the suspect's description near to the Spar Shop on Sunday evening. We would also like to speak to the person wearing the white/light coloured coat as they may have important information that could assist the investigation.

Anyone with information should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for DC 1030 ROBINSON. You can also email Thomas.robinson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
