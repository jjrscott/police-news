An 18-year-old man from Skipton is due to appear at court charged with assaulting two ambulance crew who were trying to help him.

The incident occurred on the town’s Broughton Road at 7.55pm on Sunday (12 April 2020).

It is understood that the man had called for medical assistance himself due to a possible seizure.

It is alleged that he became aggressive inside the ambulance and spat at the two crew members. It is also alleged that he threatened to cough in their faces after making reference to the coronavirus.

Police were called to the scene and he was arrested and forcibly removed from the ambulance.

Following questioning in custody and further police enquiries, the man was charged with two counts of assaulting an emergency worker.

He was released on bail and will appear at Skipton Magistrates’ Court on 22 May, 9.30am, court room 1.

Detective Superintendent Steve Thomas, Senior Operational Commander for Harrogate and Craven, said: “While I cannot comment on this specific case for legal reasons, it is clearly abhorrent behaviour to assault by spitting or make such threats against any emergency worker. This is especially so at a time of national emergency due to the coronavirus pandemic when the risk of infection remains high.

“Anyone suspected of committing such a crime against emergency workers can expect to face prosecution.”
