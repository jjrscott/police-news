Scarborough Coroner’s Office has issued a next-of-kin appeal following the sudden death of an 83-year-old man.

John Koning Bouman was found deceased by the police at his home in the Northstead area of the town after his GP had raised concerns about his welfare just after 5.30pm on Tuesday (9 June 2020).

There are no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death.

So far, Scarborough Coroner’s Office has been unable to trace Mr Koning Bouman’s next-of-kin to formally identify him.

They are appealing for his relatives and people who knew him to get in touch as soon as possible.
