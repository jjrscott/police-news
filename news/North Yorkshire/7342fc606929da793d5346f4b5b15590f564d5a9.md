Police are appealing for information following a burglary in Middleton Tyas near Richmond.

Between 3.15pm and 5.30pm on Monday 16 May 2016, burglars forced their way into a property on Middleton Tyas lane and stole several items of jewellery.

They took gold and silver jewellery including a distinctive blue, zircon cluster ring, earrings, lockets, bracelets and a gold and silver engagement ring bought in the 1940s.

The jewellery has great sentimental value as many of the items were gifts from the victim's late husband and late mother.

Police are appealing to anyone who saw any suspicious activity in the area on Monday or the days leading up to the burglary and to anyone who has been offered the blue zircon ring (pictured) for sale.

Anyone with any information that could help the investigation is asked to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for PC Richard Grey or email Richard.grey@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote reference number 12160085453 when calling.
