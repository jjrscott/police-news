A Scarborough man convicted of a child sex offence has been sentenced today (Tuesday 20 February 2018) at York Crown Court.

Lee Traquair-Hull, aged 34, of Seamer Road, Scarborough, was jailed for 15 months for causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, and given two months concurrent for publishing an obscene article.

Detectives opened an investigation in June 2016, following a report that Traquair-Hull had begun a text message conversation with a teenage girl with the intention to meet her for sex. Following his arrest, he was charged and pleaded guilty at a hearing in January. Traquair-Hull was bailed to appear back at York Crown Court today where he was sentenced.

DC Jon Kenworthy, of North Yorkshire Police’s Serious Crime Team, said: “The sentence given to Traquair-Hull today shows the seriousness of his offending. Children should be able to enjoy their teenage years without fear of predatory advances from anyone intending to exploit them, and victims can be reassured that they will be treated sensitively, and offenders dealt with robustly. I thank the victim for her courage in coming forward and remaining strong throughout the investigation to seek justice.”

In addition to his custodial sentence, Hull was issued with a Sexual Harm Prevention Order for ten years and required to sign the Sex Offenders Register for ten years.
