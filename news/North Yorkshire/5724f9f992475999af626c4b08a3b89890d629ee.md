North Yorkshire Police are urging people to be vigilant following a number of purse and handbag thefts in Scarborough town centre.

Over the busy bank holiday weekend we have had a number of reported purses and handbags that have been stolen from Scarborough town centre.

Officers are urging people to be vigilant and take precautions to reduce the risk of becoming a victim of theft.

PC 119 Sharp, of Scarborough Police, say's "Scarborough is a safe place, but people still need to be vigilant. If you carry a handbag, keep it close to your body. Never let your handbag out of your sight, this includes holding it behind your back or leaving it on your trolley while shopping. Keep it zipped with no valuable items on display. You should also consider attaching your purse to your handbag with a secure cord."

Having your purse or handbag stolen can be very upsetting. Even though these can be easily replaced it's all the personal items that you carry in them that are irreplaceable and sentimental.

If you can help, please contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for PC 119 Sharp. You can also email kelly.sharp@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
