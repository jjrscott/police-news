A routine check for Coronavirus regulations turned into an arrest for supplying drugs and the seizure of a large amount of cannabis in North Yorkshire.

At about 10.55am on Monday 27 April 2020, North Yorkshire Police officers were on patrol on the A1(M) near Scotch Corner. A grey VW Passat was stopped, and the driver spoken to.

While talking to the driver, officers noticed a strong smell of cannabis. A search of the vehicle revealed several shopping bags full of suspected cannabis, with a street value of tens of thousands of pounds. The car itself was also seized for being driven uninsured.

The driver, a 25-year-old man, was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply cannabis, and driving without insurance.

He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
