Police are appealing for witnesses after incidents involving a couple in York city centre.

Between 9.30pm and 9.50pm on Saturday 5 May, a man and a woman who had a dog with them were seen arguing on Coney Street. Police were called with a report that the man assaulted the woman as they walked along Coney Street, and then again as they walked up New Street towards Davygate. The woman was not visibly injured, however she is believed to be pregnant.

Any witnesses to either incident are asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, and ask for Investigator Katie Swift, or email katie.swift@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk, quoting incident number 12180078076.

A 23-year-old York man was arrested on suspicion of assault in connection with the incidents, and has been released on bail as enquiries continue.
