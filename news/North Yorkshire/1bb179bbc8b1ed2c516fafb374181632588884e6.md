York police are investigating a violent attack on a Spanish couple.

The incident, which occurred in the New Street, Coney Street and St Helen's Square area between 3.40am and 3.50am on Sunday (5 April 2015), involved five men who seemingly targeted the man and woman because they are from another country.

The couple had been enjoying a night out and had left the Blue Fly Caf√© Bar on New Street shortly before the attack.

It is alleged the suspects repeatedly punched and kicked the man, who is aged 24, over a period of 10 minutes along the city centre route.

The victim suffered serious injuries including a broken jaw, chipped teeth and bruising. He received emergency treatment at York District Hospital.

His girlfriend, aged 29, was repeatedly pushed to the ground while he was being attacked.

It is believed the only reason the suspects stopped the violence was because a passing taxi driver came to the couple's assistance.

The suspects were described as white, aged between 20 and 25, short or shaved hair and spoke with English accents.

One of the men was about 5ft 7in tall, had short or shaved brown hair, and was wearing a short-sleeved, light-coloured t-shirt with trousers.

PC Sophie Wilson, of the York Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "This is a very disturbing incident which will quite rightly shock the local community in York and those who regard the city as a friendly and safe place to visit.

"We are doing everything we can investigate this case and bring those responsible to justice. We are also providing support to the young couple from Spain who have had their stay tarnished in the most sickening and vicious way."

As well as a general appeal for witnesses and information about the attack, PC Wilson is also making a specific appeal to trace the taxi driver who came to the aid of the couple.

She said: "The victims are extremely grateful to the taxi driver for having the decency to stop and help when they were in a very frightening situation. I am appealing for the taxi driver to get in touch as soon as possible as he may have vital information about the suspects and the circumstances surrounding the incident."
