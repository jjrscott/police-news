A lecturer, photographer, student and casino inspector are among the latest recruits to join North Yorkshire Police's Special Constabulary.

26 brand new Special Constables were welcomed to the force at an attestation ceremony held at police headquarters in Newby Wiske last night (27 April 2017).

The volunteer officers were attested in front of family and friends by Mr Duncan Webster JP, Deputy Chair of the Bench at Northallerton Magistrates' Court.

The attestation - which is when the officers are sworn in and given their warrant cards - followed their intensive, initial training period of three months.

They will now work with experienced colleagues on their neighbourhood beats who will guide them through the next phase of their training - which can take up to two years.

They were welcomed to North Yorkshire Police by Assistant Chief Constable Ken McIntosh. He said: "Being a Special Constable takes a lot of time, energy and sacrifice and in reaching this milestone, our new officers can be extremely proud of themselves. It takes a special kind of person to juggle employment, family commitments and leisure time with the demands of being a Special Constable.

"I thank them all for choosing to give up their time for North Yorkshire's communities and welcome them to the force, they can look forward to a challenging but very rewarding career."

Julia Mulligan Police and Crime Commissioner for North Yorkshire, said: "My warmest congratulations to our new recruits on this important day. Becoming a Special Constable for North Yorkshire Police is one of the most challenging and rewarding voluntary roles in public service.

"Our Special Constables come from many different walks of life but all share a desire to make a real difference and to forge a vital link between their community and the police service."

The 26 specials will be based in the following areas:

 * York and Selby: 11 specials
 * Scarborough and Whitby: nine specials
 * Malton: one special
 * Northallerton: three specials
 * Richmond and Harrogate: one special for each area

Special Constables, or "specials" as they are also known, are volunteer officers who give up their own time to support their regular colleagues.

They play a key role in local policing and have the same powers in law as regular police officers, including the power of arrest. However, the role of specials can also extend into more complex areas of policing.
