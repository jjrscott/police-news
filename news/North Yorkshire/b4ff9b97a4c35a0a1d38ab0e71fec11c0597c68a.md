On Wednesday 16 August 2017 at about 3.25pm, a serious road traffic collision occurred on the A171 Guisborough Road, Whitby, near the junction with Newholm, involving a horse box and a male pedestrian.

A 56-year-old from Whitby suffered arm and head injuries. He was taken by ambulance to James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough where he is in serious but stable condition.

It is believed the injured man was walking with a woman along the grass verge on the left hand side of the road towards Whitby, when he was struck by the horse box.

Police are appealing to witnesses who either saw the manner of driving of the horse box prior to or at the time of the collision, as well as the man and woman who were walking near the road.
