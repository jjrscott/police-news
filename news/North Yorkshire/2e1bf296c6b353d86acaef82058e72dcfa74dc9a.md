Two men have been arrested at Tesco in Thirsk on suspicion of theft.

Earlier today (Friday 12 January 2018) police were alerted by Hambleton District Council CCTV to a suspicious vehicle, which had been seen travelling in the Hambleton area, that was believed to be linked to the theft of a vacuum cleaner from the Cooperative store in Bedale.

Shortly after at 10.50am, police were contacted by the Tesco store in Northallerton, to report two men who had attempted to steal a TV and had been seen to get into a vehicle matching the description of the suspicious vehicle sighted earlier in the day.

CCTV again located the vehicle and found it to be travelling in the direction of the Tesco store in Thirsk. The vehicle was seen to park in the car park and two men enter the Thirsk store.

Police attended the store and two men, a 28-year-old man and a 31-year old man both from Middlesbrough, were arrested on suspicion of theft. They both currently remain in police custody.
