North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about an incident in which a woman was struck and injured by a car in Acomb.

The victim, a woman in her 60s, was struck from behind by the vehicle in the car park of Priory Medical Group on Cornlands Road in Acomb, York. She sustained bruising and swelling to her lower leg.

It happened between 10am and noon on 22 January 2019.

The driver of the vehicle is described as a woman in her sixties with short blond/grey hair. A male passenger also exited the vehicle and spoke briefly to the injured female.

The female driver of a second vehicle that witnessed the collision also exited her vehicle and helped the injured woman into the medical centre.

We are appealing for the driver, her passenger, and the woman witness from the second vehicle to get in touch as soon as possible so the full circumstances of the incident can be established.
