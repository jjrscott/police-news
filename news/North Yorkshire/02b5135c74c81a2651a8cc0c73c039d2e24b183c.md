Band Runner is a fun game that puts children’s knowledge about online safety to the test by asking them to help characters make safe choices.

Players can choose to play the game as characters Ellie or Sam who use their guitars to eliminate all obstacles in their path as they run through school in order to make it to their next gig.

If players miss a jump or take a tumble, they then need to help Alfie solve an online safety dilemma to be able to continue play.

As players pass to the next level, the running gets faster!

Band Runner is on the **Thinkuknow**website and is aimed at 8 to 10-year olds. The site also provides clear and practical online safety advice about playing games, being kind to others, sharing videos and photos, chatting, keeping information private and exploring the internet.
