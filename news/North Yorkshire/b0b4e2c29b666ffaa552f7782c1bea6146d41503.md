Police investigating a serious sexual offence in York have renewed their appeal for a member of the public who could have important information to come forward.

It follows an incident in which a woman was attacked by a man in the Nunnery Lane area of York at 11.45pm Tuesday.

The next day, a member of the public approached a PCSO and told him that her son had found a mobile phone near Victoria Bar, on nearby Victoria Street.

She handed it to a PCSO but did not leave her details, and seemed to be in a rush.

Police would like this woman to contact them, as she may have vital information that could help the investigation.

Officers are urging her to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 1 and quote reference number 12190082593.

A man in his 40s from York was arrested in connection with the incident and was released on bail while enquiries continue.
