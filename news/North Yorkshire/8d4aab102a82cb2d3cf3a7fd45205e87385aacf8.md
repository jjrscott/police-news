Police are appealing for witnesses after a serious collision involving six vehicles between Northallerton and Thirsk

At about 5.40pm on Friday 17 June 2016, police were called to reports of a collision on the A168 at Thornton-le-Moor, between Northallerton and Thirsk.

The collision involved four motorcycles and two cars. As a result of the collision, two of the motorcyclists were taken by land and air ambulance to James Cook hospital, with serious injuries.

The road was closed to allow specialist collision investigators to examine the scene, and reopened just after 11.30pm.

The vehicles involved in the collision were a red Nissan Note, a silver Kia Sportage, a blue Suzuki GSX, a blue Harley Davidson XFD, a black Honda XL and a black Triumph Tiger.

Police are appealing for anyone who witnessed the collision, or may have seen the vehicles involved prior to it, to get in touch. Please dial 101, select option 2 and ask for Traffic Sergeant Paul Cording, quoting reference number NYP-17062016-0408.
