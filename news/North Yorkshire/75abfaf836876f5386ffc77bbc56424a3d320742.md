Shortly before 8pm yesterday (4 December) police attended a boat moored on the River Ouse close to Museum Street in York after concerns were raised for two men in their 60's who had been out of touch with their families. Sadly, on arrival officers found the bodies of two men on board the boat. Fire and ambulance services both attended and the bodies have been removed.

An investigation is ongoing to determine the circumstances that led to their deaths which are being treated as unexplained at this time pending the results of a post mortem. We are not yet in a position to identify the two men.

Update 10 December 2019: A post mortem examination has been carried out following the death of the two men. At this stage the coroner is awaiting the results of toxicology tests to determine the cause of death. We are not yet in a position to release the identity of the men that died.
