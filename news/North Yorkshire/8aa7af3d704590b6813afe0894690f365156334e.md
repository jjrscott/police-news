Shortly before 8pm on Monday 15 March 2021, police received reports of concern for the safety of a man near Ouse Bridge in York.

Police negotiators attended and spoke to the man at length. At about 12.30am he was secured by officers. He will attend a police station as a voluntary attendee in connection with the incident at a later date.

We are grateful to the ambulance service, fire service and York Rescue Boat who all assisted in this incident.

The bridge was closed to all traffic whilst we dealt with the incident. It reopened shortly after 12.30am on Tuesday 16 March.
