Police investigating a pub burglary in Ryedale are appealing for information from the public.

Thieves broke in to the Smithy Arms on Malton Road, Swinton, and stole a till and a safe containing cash.

The incident was reported at around 7am yesterday (16 November) and is believed to have taken place over night, in the early hours.

Police are carrying out extensive enquiries, including forensic examinations of the scene.

Officers have also released CCTV images of men they want to trace in connection with the incident.

A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said: “These CCTV images are decent quality and should help people recognise the men in question.

“If you think you know who they are, we’re very keen to hear from you.”

If you recognise the men, or have any information about the burglary that could help officers catch the offenders, please contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for Paul O’Neill, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
