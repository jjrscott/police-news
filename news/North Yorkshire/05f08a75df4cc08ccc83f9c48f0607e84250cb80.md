If you've got plans for Halloween this year follow these top ten tips for staying safe.

1\. Some masks can obstruct vision, a potential danger, when crossing roads. Consider using face paints instead.

2\. If your children are out on the streets, make sure they are wearing visible clothing - consider using reflective tape.

3\. When trick or treating, Children should go out in groups, younger children should be accompanied by an adult.

4\. Older children should agree with parents or guardians in advance exactly where they are going and when they will be back.

5\. Make sure children know not to enter anyone’s house and not to accept lifts in people’s cars.

6\. Talk through the idea of trick or treat, and make sure your children don’t do anything to upset or annoy the people they visit.

7\. Keep to pavements and trick or treat on one side of the street before crossing safely to the other side – don’t criss-cross.

8\. Stay in well lit areas where there are plenty of houses.

9\. Carefully check all the things children have been given. Sweets and food that are still in their original wrappers are safest.

10\. Remember – have fun but be safe!
