North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a fire that occurred in Nether Poppleton.

At approximately 8.45pm on Wednesday 9 March 2016, a member of the public reported a fire at a power sub-station at the end of Great North Way in Nether Poppleton.

Enquiries conducted by emergency services have revealed that the fire was started deliberately. Fortunately, the damage caused was minor and, as far as we are aware, no one was hurt.

Three people were seen leaving the scene on pedal cycles around the time of the incident.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the public's assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident. In particular, we want to speak to the three people seen leaving the scene of the fire.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for PC Alastair FOY. You can also email alastair.foy@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
