Police investigating a non-recent serious sexual assault are appealing for information from the public.

The victim, a man now in his fifties, was assaulted at the age of 8, by another male at Aldwark Manor Boarding School near York.

Officers are wanting to speak to any ex-pupils or members of staff from who attended the school in the early seventies when it was owned and run by the East Riding Authority.

Police are hoping that anyone who attended, worked at or visited the school in the early seventies will get in touch to provide any information they can.

The school closed in 1977 and the Manor became a hotel and golf course. The current business has no connection to the investigation.

Anyone who has any information, however irrelevant it might seem, is asked to contact the police.

Dial 101, press 2 and ask to speak to “Serious Crime Team, Hambleton”. Alternatively you can email Gary.Ient@Northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Please quote reference number 12180128844 when passing on any information.
