You might remember this incident back in January when we arrested a man following a pursuit through York in the early hours on 26 January 2021.

The driver of the car, who only held a provisional licence, was jailed earlier this week for 14 months after pleading guilty to dangerous driving, driving with no insurance and driving without a supervisor. He was also banned from driving for two years and seven months and must take an extended driving test.

Watch the pursuit here:

At around 1.15am officers' suspicious were raised about a vehicle in the Acomb area. They attempted to stop the car but it but it drove off without stopping.

It was followed by officers to the A64 before turning into the wrong carriageway. For safety reasons, officers stopped following the car at this point, but it was picked up again by officers when it drove onto York ring road.

Again it failed to stop for them, but it was brought to a stop by specially-trained officers a short time later at Askham Bar roundabout.

The driver was arrested on suspicion of multiple offences including possessing cocaine with intent to supply, failing to stop for the police, dangerous driving, drug driving, theft, driving without insurance or licence, and a fraud offence. He remains in custody for questioning.
