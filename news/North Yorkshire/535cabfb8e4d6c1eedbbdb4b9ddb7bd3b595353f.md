Yesterday (Tuesday 9 April 2019) at Teesside Crown Court, Judge D Sherwin sentenced Andrew Smart of Armadale Close, Stockton, to 12 months, suspended for two years, plus a 240 hours unpaid work order, for the theft of more than Â£44,000 from the North Yorkshire Police branch of Police Sport UK, which he served as Treasurer.

Smart was employed by North Yorkshire Police at the time the offence was committed. He was suspended as a result of the investigation and subsequently resigned.

The North Yorkshire Police branch of Police Sport UK is a voluntary organisation - independent of the Force - that supports the activity of sixteen different sports in the service. It has approximately 500 serving members and is funded by their monthly subscription fees.

Commenting on the case, Richard Flint, Chairman of the North Yorkshire Police branch of Police Sport UK, said:

"We lost a significant amount of our savings as a result of this crime, although some of that has been paid back. Since then we have changed our financial procedures so nothing like this can happen again. Fortunately, our branch of Police Sport UK still has sufficient funds to support our members' sporting activities, so we can now put this crime behind us and focus on doing just that."
