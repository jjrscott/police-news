North Yorkshire Police were called at around 6pm on Sunday 22 February 2015, to a report of a man being swept out to sea near the Spa in Scarborough's South Bay.

The RNLI and Coastguard also attended the scene of the incident, with air support provided by RAF Leconfield.

An unconscious man was recovered from the water at around 6.40pm and taken to Scarborough District Hospital. Sadly, despite the efforts of paramedics and hospital staff, he was pronounced deceased at hospital.

The man is from Scarborough and aged in his thirties, however, we are not yet in a position to release his name.

It is understood that the man was walking in the area with his dog and a friend when he got into difficulties.

The man's friend was also taken to hospital suffering from shock and the effects of the cold, but has since been discharged.

A family who were walking nearby, raised the alarm with the emergency services.
