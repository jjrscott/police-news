A man has been arrested after a woman was assaulted by an intruder in her York home.

It happened at a house in Goodwood Grove, York, at around 3am yesterday.

Police launched an investigation immediately and man in his 30s was promptly arrested on suspicion of burglary and assault.

The woman was punched during the incident and while she did not sustain serious injuries, she was understandably shaken by the ordeal.

The man was taken into custody and has been released under investigation so further enquiries can be carried out.

The offender is believed to have snatched a black leather bag containing school books from the address. Police are urging neighbours to check their gardens and contact North Yorkshire Police if they find any of the items, as they may be useful for the investigation.

Officers are also asking anyone who lives in the area to check their garden sheds, garages and homes and report any signs of a break-in.

They are also requested to report any vehicle damage or attempted vehicle break-ins, which may have happened around the same time.

If you have information to report, contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for David Pegg or Karl May. You can also email david.pegg@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk or karl.may@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
