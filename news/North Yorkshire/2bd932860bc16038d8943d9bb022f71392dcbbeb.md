North Yorkshire Police are appealing for witnesses and information about a burglary that occurred at a farm near Hovingham, Ryedale.

The theft of 200 large white pigs from a shed occurred over a six week period at Moor House Farm between the middle of May 2015 and the end of June 2015.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the public's assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about any vehicles or people that have been seen acting suspiciously near the farm which is accessible from Potticar Bank. Anyone who has any knowledge of the same breed of pigs that may have been sold at auction recently is also urged to come forward..

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for PC Laura Cromwell.
