Police are appealing for witnesses after two sexual assaults occurred in York.

On Friday 29 June 2018, at about 10pm, a man pushing a bike approached a woman on the cycle path between Scarborough Bridge and Jubilee Terrace, and touched her inappropriately.

A similar incident occurred on Monday 2 July 2018, also at about 10pm, when a man on a bike touched a woman inappropriately on Jubilee Terrace.

A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: "While York is an extremely safe city, it's important to continue to follow police safety advice, such as planning your route home, sticking to well-lit main roads and footpaths, and taking public transport if possible. Always report anything suspicious to the police on 101, or 999 if it's an emergency.

"Reassurance patrols have taken place in the local area, and extensive enquiries are ongoing into both incidents, including the possibility that they are linked.

"Anyone with information that could assist the investigation is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101. Select option 2 and ask for the York Investigation Hub, or email investigationhubyork@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

"Please quote reference numbers 12180116909 or 12180118925 when passing information."
