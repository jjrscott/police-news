Martin is the Neighbourhood Policing Inspector for Selby and has served with North Yorkshire Police for 23 years. He has only recently taken over as the Inspector in the Selby District and is looking forward to making a difference to the people who live and visit the district. With summer on its way, here he provides an update on local policing activities in the area…

**Protecting vulnerable people**

By working together with partners in the Selby Safer Community Hub, sharing information and putting resources from all partners into solving issues and complaints, we have been targeting those suffering from anti-social behaviours by providing specific patrols and interventions to challenge the behaviour of offenders.

A partnership hub with Selby District Council has also recently been developed, allowing a more streamlined process and the sharing of information so vulnerable people in need can be correctly identified and provided with help at the earliest opportunity. Over the last couple of months we have seen a multi-agency approach to providing care and assistance for a vulnerable female suffering with a terminal illness. By working together we were able to identify a local criminal who we believed was targeting this victim and we have managed to put together sufficient evidence to arrest the suspected offender.

We regularly target cross border criminality and remain proactive in assessing the risks to local people from current behaviours such as ‘County Lines’ whereby cross border criminals are known to prey on the vulnerable to assist in their drug dealing activities. This is an ongoing struggle but presently I believe that we are in a strong position, having said that we are always open to receive new information if it is available.

**Anti- social behaviour**

We have been working alongside partner agencies to reduce incidents of anti-social behaviour within Selby town centre and to improve the quality of life for people living in and visiting the town. We have been working to establish activities for young people who may become involved in anti-social behaviour, to prevent them becoming criminalised. The team will be running specific operations throughout the year to target this and media coverage will follow when appropriate to update the public about this.

Where appropriate, we have been utilising the powers provided by anti-social behaviour legislation in order to secure Criminal Behaviour Orders and civil injunctions against those that continue to cause disruption and harm within the community. Already, we have seen a reduction in reports of anti-social behaviour in the town centre as a result of highly visible patrols by the Neighbourhood Policing Team. We engage with those suspected to be involved on a regular basis and raise repeat behaviour to a multi-agency forum to discuss and tackle such issues.

We are aware of an emerging trend in the village of Eggborough and so our local officers are committed to making the residents of this village feel safer. We have regular contact with those involved and maintain a good level of communication with them. The local sergeant, Lee Maeer has recently led a proactive operation regarding this matter and worked with colleagues from the Humberside police force in order to manage the residents’ concerns.

**Criminal damage**

During the last year there has been a rise in reports of criminal damage across the town, some which is linked to the rise in anti-social behaviour. These vary in terms of the method but most recently we have seen a rise in damage caused by fires. Working with partners, including the fire service we are reducing the opportunities for these types of crime and sharing information to ensure all investigative opportunities are taken. Regular high visibility patrols target hot-spot areas and plans are in place to implement other methods with the aim to detect and deter. The use of CCTV and monitoring equipment has been increased and targeted operations continue, utilising plain clothes police officers.

**Burglary**

There has been an increase in burglaries in non-dwelling premises particularly sheds on allotments and garages/outbuildings. To combat non dwelling burglaries the team have been, and will continue to, target this type of crime by working with property owners to provide security advice where appropriate. One of the difficulties in detecting this type of crime is identifying stolen property, due to the often generic details of property stolen. We have invested in top of the range ‘Dot peen’ property marking machines and offer it as a free service to Selby residents which results in each piece of property then becoming unique marked and identifiable. We continue to encourage the public to have all types of property marked; from the generic garden spades and forks to the more expensive items such as cycles and golf clubs. Visit our website for more information.

**Rural crime**

At present there is a trend of homes being burgled, with cash and jewellery favoured. Entry is often via UPVC doors, with the lock being forced, or by windows broken, either in the patio doors or ground floor windows. We continue to urge residents ensure that their “euro profile” locks (the type fitted to UPVC doors) are upgraded to “snap-proof,” to prevent relatively easy access to a home. otherwise, please add bolts, or secondary locks to the inside of the door. We know that the offenders travel into our district and by using ANPR, marked patrols and plain vehicles, we have been, and will continue to target their offending.

**Looking forward**

We will be helping to police the Tour De Yorkshire in early May with our colleagues from neighbouring force areas. This is usually a very enjoyable event to police as the excitement and participation from the gathered crowd adds a nice degree of excitement. If you see us, come and say hello!

As we approach the summer months however I expect the demand will increase as it usually does as the days get gradually warmer and indeed longer. I have, however, only recently taken over as the Inspector in the Selby District and I look forward to working positively towards making the residents and many visitors feel safe whilst in the district.
