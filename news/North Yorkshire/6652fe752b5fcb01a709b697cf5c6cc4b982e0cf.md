North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a collision on the A1237/B1224 Rufforth roundabout in York in which a driver failed to stop.

It happened at around 6.45am on Tuesday (22 January).

A man riding a black and silver pedal cycle was in collision with a small red hatchback as he cycled from Acomb over the roundabout in the direction of Rufforth.

The red hatchback was travelling along the A1237 from Woodthorpe in the direction of Poppleton and did not stop at the scene.

The rider of the pedal cycle was wearing a yellow jacket. He suffered minor injuries to his knee but was able to continue his journey after being knocked to the ground.

We are appealing for witnesses to the collision or anyone who recalls seeing the small red hatchback or pedal cyclist prior to the collision - or who may have dashcam footage - to get in touch as soon as possible to assist the investigation. In particular, officers would like to speak to the male driver of a small silver saloon car that stopped briefly to check on the cyclist at the scene before leaving in the direction of Poppleton.

If you can help, please contact North Yorkshire Police on 101 and quote 12190016230. You can also email 000278@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
