From 15 October, the front counters of police stations in York, Scarborough and Harrogate will close at 8pm in the evening.

The new closing time means that these front counters will be open for 12 hours a day between 8am and 8pm. They will now be closed between 8pm and 10pm because analysis of the footfall at these times has shown than fewer than four people each day at each station during these hours. By closing earlier the Force will save on costs.

Chief Constable Lisa Winward said:

"Like other police forces and public services, budgets are very tight, so we are looking at lots of ways reduce our costs, and prioritize the services that matter most in keeping the public safe. This change to front counter opening times is part of that process, and we look forward to being able to reinvest the savings into frontline police resources, which are badly needed."
