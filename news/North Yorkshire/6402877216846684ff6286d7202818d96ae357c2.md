His wife Karen said: ‚ÄúThis was my husband üíî He was the happiest of souls, I am truly heartbroken.

‚ÄúI want to say thank you to the kind people who tried in vain to help him, but if anyone else can help with any more info I will be grateful.

‚ÄúNot sure where the hell I go from here, I‚Äôm numb. You never think these things are going to happen to you.
