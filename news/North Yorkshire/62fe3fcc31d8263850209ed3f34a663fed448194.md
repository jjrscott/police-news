North Yorkshire Police are appealing for witnesses following an attempted robbery in York.

The incident occurred at around 5pm on Wednesday, 13 June when a woman in her 40s was walking along Blue Bridge Lane, near the little blue bridge and River Ouse behind Mecca Bingo when she was approached from behind by a man.

The man jumped on the victim’s back causing her to fall to the ground. It is then believed the man has searched the victim’s clothing for money. It is believed nothing was taken during the incident.
