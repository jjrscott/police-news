On Friday 2 October 2020, North Yorkshire Police were called with a report that overnight a number of horses had forced their way out of a field in Bulmer.

Sadly, one suffered fatal injuries. It is believed the horses may have been spooked by poachers in the field.

Enquiries are ongoing, and officers from North Yorkshire Police’s Rural Taskforce will be speaking to the owner as soon as possible.

A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: “It’s clear that poachers have absolutely no regard for the senseless damage they inflict on animals, property, farmers and landowners. This awful incident would be another demonstration of the terrible impact that hare coursing can have in rural communities – which is why we treat all reports of this illegal activity in North Yorkshire so seriously.

“Anyone caught poaching in our area can expect to be summonsed to court, while those stopped in suspicious circumstances may be issued with a community protection notice – breaches of which will be prosecuted.

“We echo Mr Easterby’s call for all incidents to be reported. It’s important to emphasise that if poaching is taking place, that means a crime is in progress, and witnesses should call the police on 999 to report it. To report suspicious circumstances, or information about suspected poachers, when it’s not urgent, call 101.”
