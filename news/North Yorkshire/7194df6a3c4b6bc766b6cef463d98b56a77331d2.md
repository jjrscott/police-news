Police want to speak to Michael Walker (pictured) in connection with a high-value jewellery theft from a shop in York.

A man entered a jeweller’s in High Ousegate posing as a customer. He asked to look at two rings. After the sales assistant took them out of the display, he distracted her and snatched one of the rings, which was worth more than £5,000.

The incident took place at 1.15pm on Friday, 5 February 2016.

Police investigating the incident would like to trace 31-year-old Mr Walker. He is originally from Liverpool and is currently believed to be in the Merseyside area. He speaks with a Liverpool accent.

Mr Walker is 6ft tall, proportionally built and has brown eyes. He has a distinctive tattoo on the inside of his right wrist which reads “Kelly Hunter” and a scar on his scalp. However, he often wears baseball caps and other headwear.

Police in Cumbria, West Yorkshire and Scotland also want to speak to Mr Walker in connection with similar incidents.

Anyone who recognises him or has any information about his whereabouts is urged to contact North Yorkshire Police immediately on 101.

Please quote incident number 12160021221 when passing on information.
