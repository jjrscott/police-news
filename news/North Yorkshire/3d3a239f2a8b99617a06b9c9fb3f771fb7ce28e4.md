Officers received a report that a man had approached a twelve year old boy as he walked home from school in Stokesley on Thursday 7 July 2016.

Police are working to establish the full circumstances and are appealing for the public’s help.

The boy was walking alone down the footpath along the back and side of houses on Eastfield at around 3.40pm when he was approached by the man. The boy managed to run away to a relative’s house.

The man is described as white, approx 6 ft tall, aged 25-40 years old, of medium build with olive/lightly tanned skin. He was wearing a black beany hat, a dark green long sleeved top with a 'v' neck but no collar and camel coloured cargo style trousers. The man had distinctive prominent veins on the side of his head near his eyes.

They would like to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time, saw anything relating to the incident or know who the man was.

If the man sees or hears this appeal himself, he is urged to come forward to the police as soon as possible to explain the situation.

Anyone with information is asked to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for PC Alastair Gill.

Or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111and quote reference number 12160120174.
