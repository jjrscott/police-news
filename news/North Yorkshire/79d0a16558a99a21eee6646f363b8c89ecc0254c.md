Users of taxis and private hire vehicles in York can be reassured that they are travelling safely, after a joint operation by North Yorkshire Police and City of York Council.

Police officers and licensing enforcement officers have worked together on a number of joint operations in recent months to check taxis and private hire vehicles in York, and the latest one has proved that the vast majority of vehicles and drivers are working safely.

A total of 14 vehicles, and taxi ranks and rendezvous points across the city, were checked on the evening of 16 February 2017. While no issues were identified in the majority of cases, some offences were dealt with, including:

 * Private hire driver not wearing a badge, in a vehicle with both front tyres below the legal limit – the plate was suspended by City of York Council and a traffic offence report issued by North Yorkshire Police
 * Private hire vehicle making an illegal right turn, with a number of inoperative lights – a traffic offence report was issued by North Yorkshire Police
 * Private hire vehicle making an illegal right turn – a traffic offence report was issued by North Yorkshire Police.

Councillor Sam Lisle, Executive Member for Community Safety, said: “This latest joint operation shows our commitment to regularly enforcing the taxi trade’s legal requirements to ensure customer safety which is our priority and which the majority of vehicles and drivers support.

“Anyone with a complaint about a York taxi should report it to us at public.protection@york.gov.uk with as much evidence as possible so it can be investigated fully.”

Inspector Andy Godfrey, of York City Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: “Members of the public who use taxis and private hires in York can be reassured that the majority of vehicles are safe and in good order.

“Our joint operation with City of York Council did, however, identify some issues, and I would urge all drivers to check their vehicles regularly to ensure they are in good order. Similar operations will continue in the near future to ensure that standards are being maintained.”
