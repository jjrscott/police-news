Police in Skipton have issued a warning and an appeal for further information after a suspected drink spiking incident in the town.

A 22-year-old woman was on a night out with friends in Skipton on the evening of Friday 24 April 2015. She went into three bars in Skipton before going to a night club and being taken ill in the early hours of Saturday.

Sergeant Mark Hill, of Craven Police, said: "I would like to remind people to be vigilant and take care of themselves and their friends on a night out. Never leave your drink unattended and don't accept a drink from someone you have just met, unless you see it being served. If you suspect that your or a friend's drink has been spiked, then tell a member of staff or the police."

You can find further personal safety advice on a night out on the North Yorkshire Police website at: http://www.northyorkshire.police.uk/11930

Sgt Hill added: "We have not had any other reports of people being taken ill in unusual circumstances that night, so if anyone knows of any other incidents of this nature please contact the police straight away."

Anyone with information is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for PC Caroline Black, or emailcaroline.black@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk.

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
