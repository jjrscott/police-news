Officers are appealing for information following a robbery at the Co-op in Catterick during the early hours of this morning (Tuesday, 2 October).

Just before 2.30am three men smashed their way into the store using sledgehammers and removed the safe and cigarettes before they left the scene on foot.

A thorough search of the area was carried out following the incident including officers on the ground and the dog unit but the offenders were not traced. A sledgehammer, believed to have been used in the offence, has been recovered this morning in a nearby field.

Officers are asking anyone who witnessed the incident or who has seen anything suspicious in the area in the days leading up to the offence to contact them with information. Officers are also keen to speak with anyone who may have seen the men following the incident.

Anyone with information is urged to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101 or if you would prefer to provide information anonymously then the independent charity Crimestoppers can be contacted on 0800 555 111.

Please provide reference 12180183953.
