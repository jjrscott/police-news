Police are appealing for an important witness to come forward to assist an investigation into a rape in York.

Officers are investigating a report of rape of a teenage girl on the evening of Thursday 7 June. The incident took place on Hob Moor, an area of common land on the outskirts of York.

A 17-year-old boy, who is known to the victim, has been arrested and released on conditional bail.

Immediately prior to the incident, the victim was in the alleyway that runs from Hob Moor Drive, onto Hob Moor itself, with the suspect. She was upset, and was pushed against a garden fence. During this altercation, a man, possibly a runner, stopped and spoke to the victim to ask if she was OK.

Officers are appealing for this man to come forward, as he may have information which could assist the investigation. They also want to hear from any other witnesses.

Anyone with information is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for York Serious Crime Team. Please quote reference number 12180101227 when passing information.
