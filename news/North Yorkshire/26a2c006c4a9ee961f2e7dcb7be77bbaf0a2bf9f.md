Uniformed and undercover police officers are out in full force in the town of Catterick today patrolling key areas including Princes Gate, Richmondshire Walk and the Munster Barracks as part of the recently-launched Project Servator.

The highly visible and covert police presence is part of an ongoing tactic recently launched by North Yorkshire Police which sees the deployment of both highly visible and covert police officers alongside other resources such as ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) and CCTV cameras in crowded places.

Project Servator, which was first introduced by City of London Police, has been successfully used and is already ‘business as usual’ for a number of other forces such as British Transport Police (BTP), Essex Police, Ministry of Defence Police and the Civil Nuclear Constabulary.

Key to the success of Project Servator is the support of people living, working and visiting the town to be extra eyes and ears for the police, reporting any suspicious behaviour to help make it even harder for criminals to succeed.

Inspector Dave Edwards, of North Yorkshire Police’s Proactive Policing Command and Operational Lead for Project Servator in Catterick, said:

“Project Servator enhances our existing crime prevention and public safety tactics and is being rolled-out in town centres and events across the county like we’ve seen in Catterick.

“Our officers have already been engaging with businesses and the local community over the last month to introduce them to the concept and to explain the vital role that they have to play.

“Our deployments are designed to be unpredictable and can turn up at any time. One day our tactics may be highly visible, the next we will be working in a more covert way.

“We’ve got strong working relationships with security teams across Catterick including The Royal Military Police and CCTV teams and by collaborating with partners such as these, and the communities that we serve, we are creating a surveillance resource that is second to none.

“We continue to call on the public to be vigilant and to report anything that they deem to be suspicious immediately by telling a police officer, or by calling 101 or 999 in an emergency or by calling the Anti-Terrorist Hotline on 0800 789 321.

Lieutenant Colonel Joe Jordan, Commander at Catterick Garrison said:

“We’re dedicated to protecting those who live in and visit Catterick and surrounding areas.

“Project Servator involves us working together with the police in a proactive and approachable way and with surrounding communities to report suspicious activity.

“People in the community know when something is out of the ordinary but haven’t always known what to do or how to report it in the past.

“This is a chance to build on the community spirit of Catterick and encourage them to be our eyes and ears.

“We can never be complacent on the subject of keeping Catterick safe but we want people to trust their instincts, if you see anything suspicious then please report it.”
