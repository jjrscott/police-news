Police have released a CCTV still of a woman they would like to speak to in connection with the theft of DVDs from a Scarborough shop.

Shortly before midday on Saturday 15 April 2017, a woman entered Argos on Newborough. She picked up four DVDs and left the store, making no attempt to pay, and headed down Eastborough.

The DVDs were copies of 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story', and worth Â£10.99 each.

Officers are keen to speak to the woman pictured on CCTV, as she may have important information that could assist the investigation.
