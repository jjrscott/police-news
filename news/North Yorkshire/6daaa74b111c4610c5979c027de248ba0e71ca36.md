Police are now in a position to name the cyclist who died earlier this month following a collision involving the cyclist and a Porsche on the A168.

He was 36 year-old Andrew Jackson (pictured) of Hunsingore, near Wetherby.

Speaking about Andrew, his family said: “We are all devastated by the loss of Andrew. To us, he was a proud father of two young children, a loving husband and a caring son.

“He will leave a gaping hole in the lives of those close to him. We would now like to request space and time to grieve for him privately.”

The collision occurred at around 1.45pm on Sunday 10 May 2020 on the A168 northbound between Allerton Park and Boroughbridge.

It involved Mr Jackson, who was riding a light blue racing bicycle, and a black Porsche 911 Carrera, which were both travelling in the same direction towards Boroughbridge.

Mr Jackson was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. The 35 year-old driver of the Porsche was arrested and has been released under investigation whilst enquiries continue.

An inquest into Mr Jackson’s death has been opened and adjourned.

Officers are continuing to appeal for witnesses, dash-cam footage or anyone who may have seen the cyclist or the Porsche prior to, and/or at the time of the incident.
