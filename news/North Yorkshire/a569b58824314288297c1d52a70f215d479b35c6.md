North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a minor collision that occurred on the A64 eastbound at the junction with Whinny Lane, Flaxton.

It happened at 06.30am on 08/08/15 and involved a white Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 32 year old male, and a black VW Golf driven by a 41 year old male.

It is believed that a third vehicle, a small black car overtook an HGV on the approach to the junction with Whinny Lane, causing the driver of the Mitsubishi to take evading action and was then involved in a collision with the Golf.

The black car did not stop at the scene.

The driver of the Mitsubishi was uninjured, the driver of the Golf sustained minor neck injuries.

We are appealing for witnesses to the collision or anyone who recalls seeing the vehicle(s) prior to the collision, to get in touch as soon as possible to assist the investigation.
