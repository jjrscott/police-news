North Yorkshire Police were contacted by a member of the public at 12.28pm on Friday (8 January 2016) regarding a landslip at the rear of Skipton Castle.

North Yorkshire County Council and Craven District Council were notified immediately and structural engineers have been called in to assess the situation. British Waterways have also been informed as it is believed that rock fell into Springs Canal and Eller Beck which run below the castle.

To help keep people safe while this work is on-going, police have cordoned off the area of concern in Skipton Woods. The county council has also diverted a nearby footpath.

Members of the public are asked to abide by the temporary safety measures until further notice.
