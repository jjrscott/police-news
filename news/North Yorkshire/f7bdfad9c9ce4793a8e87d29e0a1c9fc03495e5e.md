North Yorkshire Police is investigating the death of a man involved in a single-vehicle collision on the north-bound carriageway of the A19 near Ingleby Arncliffe at 5.10pm on Saturday (19 Sept 2015).

The man, who is aged 55 and from Norton, Stockton-on-Tees, was driving a black Peugeot Expert van which is believed to have collided into the central reservation just past the Exelby service station before veering left into a field.

Paramedics and members of the public attempted to revive the man but he was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

A woman passenger in the van was taken James Cook Hospital for precautionary checks.

The section of road was closed, with local diversions in place, to allow a full police examination of the collision scene and to assist the recovery of the van. The road re-opened at 9.15pm.

Officers are appealing for anyone who witnessed the collision or recall seeing the vehicle being driven on the A19 prior to the incident, to come forward to assist the investigation.

If you can help, please contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Iain Atkinson from the Major Collision Investigation Team. Or email Iain.Atkinson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk or MCIT@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk quoting reference number 12150165927.

We are not a position to name the man at this time.
