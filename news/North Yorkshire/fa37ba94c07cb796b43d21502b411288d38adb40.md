Police attended the scene of a collision involving a tractor and a car on the A19 at Escrick last night.

The collision took place at about 9.15pm on Monday 7 December 2020, on the A19 at Escrick, and involved a black VW Beetle and a yellow JCB Fastrac towing a slurry tanker.

As a result of the collision, the JCB ended up on top of the car, trapping a passenger inside. The slurry tanker was damaged, which resulted in a large amount of its contents leaking onto the road.

A passenger in the VW was extracted by North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service colleagues and taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries. The VW driver was taken to hospital with minor injuries. The JCB driver was uninjured.

The police investigation and recovery of the vehicles was completed by 2am, but the A19 remained closed for several more hours while the carriageway was cleared of contaminated substances.

Anyone who witnessed the collision, or saw either vehicle beforehand, and who has not already spoken to police, is asked to email mark.patterson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk or call 101 quoting reference number 12200222506.
