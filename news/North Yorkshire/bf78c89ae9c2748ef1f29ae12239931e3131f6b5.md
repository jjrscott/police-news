A North Yorkshire Police spokesperson said:

“The tragic death of Sarah Everard in London has deeply saddened everyone at North Yorkshire Police. Around 150-200 people attended a candlelit vigil outside York Minster on Saturday (13 March) evening in memory of Sarah.

“Officers allowed people to lay flowers whilst ensuring that the gathering took place in a safe and lawful way. No enforcement action was taken against anyone in attendance and most people had left the area by around 6.30pm.

“Our thoughts are with Sarah’s loved ones at this very sad time.”
