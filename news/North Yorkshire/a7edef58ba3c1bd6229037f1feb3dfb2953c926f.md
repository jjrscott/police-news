North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about an assault that occurred in Harrogate.

It happened on West End Avenue at around 5pm hours on 6 August 2016 and involved an alleged assault, in which a woman was grabbed by the throat and punched once to the face.

A male was arrested later that evening and has been released on bail while further enquiries are conducted.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about a man who may have intervened during the incident at the time.

We are especially interested in speaking to this man who may have been driving a red VW Passat or similar vehicle. It is believed that he may be able to greatly assist police with their enquiries but he left the scene prior to his details being obtained.

If you know of this man, or you have witnessed this incident, we would like to speak with you.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for Neil Sisson. You can also email neil.sisson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12160141254.
