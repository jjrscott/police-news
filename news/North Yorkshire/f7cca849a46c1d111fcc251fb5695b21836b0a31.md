Below are the enforcement locations for North Yorkshire Police's mobile safety cameras for week commencing Wednesday 10 February 2016.

The safety cameras are now more visible than ever before with each of the vehicles bearing the same hi-vis livery as North Yorkshire Police's marked vehicle fleet.

All safety camera locations are published on the force website along with an explanation of the various route types.

Members of the public can also view the results of the safety camera enforcement activity on the force website. Up to date data for the previous week is uploaded every week which can be interrogated by route and date ranges. _http://www.northyorkshire.police.uk/10951_

The mobile safety cameras will be in operation at the following sites at various times over the coming week. Cameras will not be in use all day, every day. The locations were accurate when this news release was produced.

The cameras operate at three difference types of site, these are:
