North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a assault that occurred in Northallerton.

It happened at approximately 3.50am on Sunday 28 January 2018 in Bullamoor Park near to Bullamoor Road and the junction with Vicars Croft, Northallerton and involved a 19-year-old woman being grabbed by a man and pushed to the ground.

We are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

Police are particularly interested in speaking to a group of three males and two females who were seen with the victim on Bullamoor Road at the junction of Vicars Croft before heading towards the town centre.

It is believed some of this group caught a taxi to Thirsk that morning.
