North Yorkshire Police is investigating a serious collision which led to the closure of the north-bound A19 between the A172 near Osmotherley and Crathorne for more than eight hours on Friday (4 October 2019) morning.

It occurred just prior to the A67 Crathorne junction at around 2.55am. A white car came to rest upside down in a ditch.

An ambulance crew spotted the car and they called for assistance from the fire service, police and also the Highway Agency to manage the road closure.

A high-volume of traffic had to be diverted north via Stokesley throughout the morning.

The driver, a man aged in his late 40s, was taken by ambulance to James Cook Hospital in Middlesbrough for treatment.

A young boy in a rear seat was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary at Newcastle.

A young girl, also in a rear seat, is receiving treatment at James Cook Hospital.

The front seat passenger, a 29-year-old woman, is believed to have escaped serious injury.

Police collision investigators carried out a full examination of the scene as part of ongoing enquiries to establish the circumstances surrounding the incident.

The stretch of road re-opened at 11.30am.
