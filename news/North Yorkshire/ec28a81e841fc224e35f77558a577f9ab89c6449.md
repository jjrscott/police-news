A retired English teacher and school rugby coach is due to appear at Bristol Crown Court on Friday 26 February 2021, charged with 42 non-recent child sexual abuse offences against 20 victims.

Peter Andrew Holmes, aged 71 (date of birth 22/03/1949), of King Street, Bristol, is alleged to have committed two counts of buggery and multiple indecent assaults and acts of gross indecency, between 1977 and 1992 while working at Malsis School in the Craven District of North Yorkshire.

All the complainants are men who were aged under 14 at the time of the allegations.

Malsis School was based at Malsis Hall, Glusburn, near Crosshills. It was an independent preparatory school until its closure in 2014.
