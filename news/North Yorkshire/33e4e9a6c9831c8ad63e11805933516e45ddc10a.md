Police in North Yorkshire are appealing to victims of tool theft along the Yorkshire Coast to contact them after officers recovered a number of suspected stolen power tools.

On the night of 23 April 2017, five men were arrested - four in Whitby and one in Cloughton - after officers stopped a suspicious vehicle.

Following a search of the vehicle, a large number of tools were recovered. Some of these have been linked to offences along the Yorkshire Coast from Bridlington to Whitby.

However, there are a number of tools left that officers believe were stolen, but the owners may not have reported the theft.

To help them reunite the tools with the rightful owners, officers are appealing to anyone who has had power tools stolen over the weekend of 22-23 April 2017, to contact them.

The recovered tools include a circular saw, jigsaw, cordless hammer drill and an angle grinder.

Anyone who believes the tools may be theirs is asked to contact Rob Henderson in Scarborough Investigation Hub on 01609 643421 , or email Robert.henderson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

Please quote reference number 12170069010 when passing on information.

All five arrested men are aged between 28 and 49 and are from various towns in West Yorkshire. They have been released while under investigation.
