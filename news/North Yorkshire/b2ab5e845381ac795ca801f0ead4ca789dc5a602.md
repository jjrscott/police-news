By the court imposing a Sexual Risk Order until further order and granting the prohibitions applied for, this recognises that North Yorkshire Police have taken the correct course of action to safeguard and protect the public from the risk, that the Court has acknowledged Mr O’Neill poses to the public.”

“It is the priority of North Yorkshire Police to protect the public from the risk of sexual harm.”
