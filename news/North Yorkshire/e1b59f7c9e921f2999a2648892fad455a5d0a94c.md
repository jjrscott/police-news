Police are appealing for witnesses after a man was seriously injured in a collision in Leyburn.

The collision occurred at about 12.20pm on Friday 30 October 2015, when a silver Toyota Rav 4 was in a queue of traffic on High Street in Leyburn, approaching the pedestrian crossing near the HSBC bank.

The Toyota stopped as another vehicle merged from the direction of Market Square. A pedestrian crossed the road, not using the crossing, behind the Toyota, as it reversed slightly backwards. A collision occurred and the pedestrian, a man in his eighties, fell to the ground and suffered a serious hip injury. He was taken to Darlington Hospital for treatment.

TC Tony Leonard, of the North Yorkshire Police Roads Policing Group, said: "I would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision. In particular, I would like to speak to the driver of the vehicle which merged with traffic onto High Street."

Anyone with information is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police. Please dial 101, select option 2 and ask for TC 1516 Tony Leonard. Alternatively, email tony.leonard@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk. Please quote incident number 12150192434.
