A man has died following a collision with a taxi on Micklegate in York today.

Police were called just after 2.30am this morning (26 March 2016) to reports of an incident involving a Ford Mondeo taxi cab and a pedestrian.

Ambulance crews were also called and treated the man at the scene. He was taken by ambulance to York District Hospital but was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.

The man is believed to be in his 20s and from the Pickering area, although police are not yet in a position to formally release his identity.
