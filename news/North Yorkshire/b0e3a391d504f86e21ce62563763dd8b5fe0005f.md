Special Constables from North Yorkshire Police, Cleveland Police and British Transport Police (BTP) will join forces this weekend, for what is expected to be another very busy time in York city centre.

With a joint aim of helping to boost visibility and provide reassurance in the city centre on Saturday, Specials from Cleveland and York and British Transport Police (BTP), will work alongside officers from York Neighbourhood Policing Team throughout the city centre.

The joint patrols also aim to target anti-social behaviour, both in York city centre but also at York station and on board train services.

**PC John Armstrong from the York City Centre Neighbourhood Policing Team, said;**

“As the summer continues to be a very busy time in the city, we want to provide reassurance that we will continue to be there for residents and visitors alike and that they enjoy themselves in a safe environment.”

**Special Sergeant Graham Hansford from Cleveland Police, added;**

“It is important that, as volunteers, Special Constables from different forces pull together to support the regular officers at such busy times.

“We know a lot of people from the Teesside area visit York on a weekend, so we wanted to work with officers in the city on this joint operation in order to keep any disruption to a minimum.”

******Special Sergeant Paul Johnson from BTP also added;**

“It is so important we work closely with police forces across the counties to make sure people stay safe. This joint operation is not just about those who are in the city centre on Saturday, it is also about making sure that those who are travelling get home safely.”
