The College of Policing today issued a report regarding the pass rate for police fitness tests across all Forces. The report shows that, for North Yorkshire Police, 98.4% of fitness tests were successful.

Commenting on the results, Acting Deputy Chief Constable Paul Kennedy said:

“We know we have some exceptional athletes amongst our officers, but this figure shows that there is a high standard of fitness across the board, and that officers achieve the required level of fitness to do the job. We take a supportive approach with those few officers who need to improve their fitness, but the statistics show that most officers are successful in the fitness test which is a positive result.”
