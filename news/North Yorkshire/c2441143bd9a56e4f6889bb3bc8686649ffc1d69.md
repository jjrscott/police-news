Deputy Chief Constable Lisa Winward said:

“I welcome the overall ‘good’ rating North Yorkshire Police has achieved in the HMICFRS Police Legitimacy report for 2017.

“Building on the previous year, it reflects the high-level of service provided to our communities and our determination to tackle crime and keep people safe from harm. We are extremely proud that North Yorkshire and the City of York continue to be the lowest crime area in England.

“The findings of the report again showed that our officers and staff behave ethically and lawfully in line with the Code of Ethics, which is embedded in the way we work on a daily basis.

“It is also shows that North Yorkshire Police cares for the wellbeing of its officers and staff and treats them fairly and with respect.

“We have, however, carefully noted the feedback about treating all the people we serve with fairness and respect, as well as introducing greater external scrutiny and more robust processes in the way we manage stop and search powers. The PEEL inspections are designed to improve policing and we fully take on board the recommendations.”
