Officers from the Cleveland and North Yorkshire Major Investigation Team have today (Monday 13 November 2017) arrested a man in connection with a rape in York which occurred more than 29 years ago.

Following questioning the 53-year-old from Goole was charged with rape, along with a Section 14 indecent assault under the previous Sexual Offences Act.

He has been remanded in custody and will appear at York Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday morning (14 November 2017).

The alleged incident occurred in the Castlegate area of the city at around 12.10am on 29 October 1988.

The victim was aged 27 at the time of the incident. She is receiving support from specialist officers as the case progresses to court.

Detective Inspector Steve Menzies, of the Cleveland and North Yorkshire Major Investigation Team, is leading the investigation.

He said: “This investigation follows a significant amount of work conducted by our collaborative Cold Case Investigation Team.

“The dedicated team is comprised of a number of officers and staff who work tirelessly to re-investigate historical cases in both Cleveland and North Yorkshire that have so far remained undetected.

“With advances in forensic science and other investigation techniques, we are determined to bring offenders to justice. Importantly, we also aim to bring some form of comfort and closure to the victims of serious crimes.”
