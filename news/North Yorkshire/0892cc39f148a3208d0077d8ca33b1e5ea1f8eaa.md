Officers from North Yorkshire Police's Rural Taskforce have taken a large amount of cannabis off the county's streets, after a strong-smelling car was stopped on the A64.

At about 5.30pm on Tuesday 19 May 2020, a white Ford Fiesta drove past an unmarked Rural Taskforce vehicle on the westbound A64 near Tadcaster.

As it passed, the car smelled so strongly of cannabis, officers followed it and brought it to a stop near the A162 junction.

The driver of the car, a 24-year-old man from Wakefield, was detained for a search under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Officers found several bags of cannabis inside the car.

He was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply cannabis, interviewed, and later released under investigation while enquiries continue.
