A suspect has been arrested and two stolen quad bikes recovered after a police pursuit in rural North Yorkshire.

Officers on patrol spotted two quad bikes travelling together along the A65 near Settle in suspicious circumstances, at 2.20am on Monday 23 July 2018.

A police ‘stinger’ device was deployed near Gargrave, stopping one of the quads. However, its rider then got on the other quad and drove off.

Specially-trained police officers pursued the remaining quad towards Ilkley along the A65, before it turned down a track at Draughton and came to a stop. Both riders ran off. A 15-year-old boy from Bradford was located in bushes nearby a few minutes later and was arrested. The other was not found, despite an extensive search.

The two Honda quad bikes, which had been stolen from a farm in Horton-in-Ribblesdale, were recovered and will be returned to their rightful owner.

The 15-year-old was arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle, burglary and dangerous driving. He was released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Anyone with information about the second suspect should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, quoting reference number 12180134089.

There were 47 quad bikes stolen in Craven in 2017, compared to 22 in 2016 and 12 in 2015. Police are urging residents in rural areas to take extra steps to secure quad bikes and other vehicles.
