Two wanted men have been arrested in the Humberside area following a police operation in York.

Officers attended an address in Cornlands Road, York, on Monday (17 August 2020), supported by the police helicopter, as part of enquiries to locate both men.

Cordons were put in place and the road was closed for a time while the operation was underway.

Officers entered the property at 1pm. Despite a thorough search, with the assistance of a police dog, no one was located inside.

The police operation continued and the men, both aged 29 and from York, were tracked down and arrested in the Humberside area. They are being held in police custody for questioning.

Local residents are thanked for their support, patience and understanding while the police operation was carried out.

**The appeal has now been cancelled. All images of the men should be removed from websites and social media.**
