Police have released two CCTV images to identify a man who may have information about two shop thefts in York.

On 27 April 2016, at about 1.25pm, a man entered Marks & Spencer on Pavement, York. He picked up a wire basket and selected a number of packs of steak and beef joints. He then walked out of the Pavement exit - the door was opened by another man, a third man took the basket from him and they walked towards Lady Peckett's Yard.

The following day, 28 April 2016, at about 12.20pm, a man entered the same shop, picked up a wire basket and selected beef joints and an item from the dessert isle. Then he walked out of the Pavement exit, where he joined three other men and they walked towards Lady Peckett's Yard.

Officers want to speak to a man pictured on CCTV images in Marks & Spencer on 27 and 28 April, as he may have important information that could assist the investigation.
