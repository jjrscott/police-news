Police are urging members of the public to be vigilant following a series of house burglaries in the Knaresborough and Boroughbridge area.

On Thursday 29 October, four burglaries occurred in the area, three in Farnham and one in Kirk Deighton.

The incidents happened during the day when the occupants were all out at work. The offenders gained entry by forcing windows and doors open.

From the targeted property Shaw Lane Famham, an ipad and Playstation were stolen. A watch, rucksack and camera were stolen from a property in Sterling Chase, Famham, and cash was stolen from a property in Ashdale View, Kirk Deighton.

Offenders gained entry to a property in Farnham Fields however the house alarm caused the offenders to make off before stealing anything.

Anyone who has any information or who witnessed anything suspicious in the area yesterday, Thursday 29 October, is asked to contact the police. Dial 101, press 1 and pass information on to the force control room.

Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.

North Yorkshire Police encourage all homeowners to make sure their home security is a priority in these winter months. A dark empty house is a target for burglars - a few simple security steps such a leaving a light or a radio on when you are out will help you to make sure your home is as safe as it can be.
