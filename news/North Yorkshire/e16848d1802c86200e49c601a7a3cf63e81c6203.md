North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about two incidents of criminal damage in Harrogate and Killinghall.

The incidents happened on Bilton Lane and Trefoil Drive between 8pm on 24 January 2021 and 11am on 25January 2021.

The victims' property has been defaced by way of a swastika being spray painted on their front door, a garage door and on one of the victim's cars. another car was damage with a painted red line.

This is an abhorrent image and one that has caused the victim considerable distress.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Jonathan Cleary. You can also email Jonathan.cleary@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
