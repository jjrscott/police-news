A police drop-in session with a difference has raised more than £800 for charity.

York’s Neighbourhood Policing Team held a Macmillan Coffee Morning event on Friday 30 September, in King’s Square – giving people the opportunity to meet their local officers and PCSOs, and support a good cause at the same time.

Cake was supplied by the Macmillan team, as well as by North Yorkshire Police officers, PCSOs and staff, along with contributions from their families and local communities. Tea and coffee was provided by Starbucks. The event was part of Macmillan's nationwide "World's Biggest Coffee Morning" fundraising campaign.

PCSO Toni Wadsworth said: “We had a great day and raised £846 for charity. That’s an amazing total, which couldn’t have been reached without the kind donations of cakes, and the generosity of residents, businesses and visitors in York.

“This amount will fund a Macmillan nurse for a week, so it will have a big impact on the lives of those receiving their care and support. The whole team are really grateful to everyone who came to meet us and support this event.”
