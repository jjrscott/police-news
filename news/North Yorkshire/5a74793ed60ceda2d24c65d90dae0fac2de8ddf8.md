Police are appealing for information after an elderly horse was found in its field in Gillamoor with an abdominal injury.

30-year-old Hannah, a Dales cross cob, sustained a cut, approximately 10 inches long between her two udders in her groin area.

The injury was discovered on the afternoon of Sunday 2 August 2015. It is believed to have happened some time since the afternoon of Saturday 1 August 2015.

The vet who attended Hannah said the wound had been inflicted deliberately and was not simply a field wound.

PC Linda Coles of Malton police said: "It is hard to imagine why anyone would want to hurt an animal in this way. Thankfully, Hannah is now recovering from her ordeal, however, a few inches either way and her injury could have been fatal.

"We are appealing to anyone who may have seen any suspicious activity over the past few days in the area of Hannah's field, which is on Main Street next to Gillamoor playing fields. And to anyone who may have any other information that could help our investigation."

Anyone with any information is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for PC Linda Coles.

Or email linda.coles@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
