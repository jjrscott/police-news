We asked some of our recent transferee officers why they joined North Yorkshire Police and here is what one of them, Sergeant Dave France, had to say.

**When did you join NYP and what area do you work in?**

_“I transferred to NYP in May 2016 and I work on the Firearms Support Unit based at Thirsk Vale House, having been initially posted to Tadcaster.”_

**What attracted you to a career with NYP?**

_“I wanted to work somewhere that offered different challenges, and also to go hand in hand with moving to an area that offered a better quality of life for my young family.”_

**Which force were you with before joining?**

_“Lancashire Constabulary for 20 years, four on I.R and 16 on Firearms Support Unit.”_

**Can you remember your first day/week with us? What was it like?**

_“I left Lancashire on the Saturday and started in NYP on the Monday so It was very strange and outside of my comfort zone having spent so long elsewhere to be faced with virtually everything being new, it felt like being a brand new Student Officer again!”_

**Is there anything that surprises you about working here?**

_“The sheer size of North Yorkshire. I knew it was big but I didn’t realise just how big it was until I started having to drive 80 odd miles to I grade incidents!”_

**What would you say to another officer thinking of transferring to NYP?**

_“It will take a period of time to get used to, especially if you currently work in a force with larger staff numbers and certainly as an officer on a specialist unit I am expected to do more in terms of general response policing, purely because staffing is spread out thinly. However I now police some of the most beautiful and historic areas in the country and I’m not exaggerating when I say it’s a pleasure to do so.”_

**What has been your proudest moment working for NYP?**

_“My proudest moment so far has to be recently being successful in my PC to Sergeant promotion board, and remaining in post on the Firearms Support Unit.”_

**What are the best things about your job/working for NYP?**

_“One of the great things about being a firearms officer in NYP is that the equipment, training and skill set we possess allow us to get involved in a variety of incidents not only in NYP but across the county lines into neighbouring force areas. No two days are the same and we are fortunate in that we have a little more time than our IR colleagues to target, disrupt and deter those who think they can come to North Yorkshire to commit organised crime.”_

**How would you describe your job in three words?**

_“Extraordinary, Satisfying and Dynamic.”_
