North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses to a driving incident on the A170 between Wykeham and West Ayton in the Scarborough area.

It happened at around 5am today (Friday 13 September 2019) when a silver Renault Scenic that was travelling westbound performed an overtaking manoeuvre on another vehicle.

A further vehicle travelling in the opposite direction was forced to brake harshly in order to avoid a collision.

The driver of the Scenic, a 44-year-old male from Scarborough, was stopped further along the A170 and is currently under investigation on suspicion of driving offences.

Investigating officer PC Liam Cromack said: "I am appealing for anybody who was driving along the A170 at the time who recalls seeing the vehicle in question to come forward. I am particularly keen to hear from the driver of the vehicle who was overtaken by the Scenic close to the junction with Hutton Buschel.

"I would also like to speak with anybody who may have dash cam footage of the vehicle, either during the incident or immediately prior, to get in touch."

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Liam Cromack. You can also email liam.cromack@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk.

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
