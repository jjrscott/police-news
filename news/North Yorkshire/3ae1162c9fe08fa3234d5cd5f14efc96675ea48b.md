Police in York are continuing to appeal for witnesses and information after a car ended up in the River Ouse.

The incident occurred near Skeldergate Bridge at around 4.30pm on Wednesday (23 September 2020).

The driver of the white Seat Leon saloon, a 45-year-old local woman, was bravely brought to safety by members of the public and she received medical care at hospital.

It was initially unclear if there were other occupants in the car when it entered the river, so emergency services carried out an intensive search operation.

This was supported by police officers from Regional Underwater Search Team, North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue and the York Rescue Boat. Paramedics were on standby throughout.

Thankfully, it has been confirmed there was nobody else in the car.

Police are investigating the driver in relation to suspected drink-driving and dangerous driving offences.
