Police have published images of two men they would like to speak to after a McDonald's flag and flag pole were stolen from Scarborough.

At about 7.30pm on Monday 17 April 2017, two men approached McDonald's on Huntriss Row, Scarborough. One of them picked up one of the flag poles that was flying a McDonald's flag. Both then ran off down Huntriss Row in the direction of the Grand Hotel. The flag and pole will cost about Â£100 to replace.

Officers would like to speak to the two men pictured on CCTV as they may have important information that could assist the investigation.

Anyone with any information about the identity of the men or the whereabouts of the flag is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for PC Robert Wardle, quoting incident number 12170065667 - or email robert.wardle@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
