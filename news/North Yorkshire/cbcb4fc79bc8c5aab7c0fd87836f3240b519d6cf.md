A number of people were standing, sitting and lying in the road outside the hydraulic fracturing site at 1.15pm today.

Officers explained they were blocking the road, and asked them to move on several occasions, but they refused to do so. Several people were then moved away by officers.

We know that there are very different views about hydraulic fracturing, but as the local police, our responsibility is to carry out our duties impartially. That means we have a duty to make sure that people who want to assemble and protest do so safely, balanced against a duty to ensure that businesses can go about their lawful commercial activity.
