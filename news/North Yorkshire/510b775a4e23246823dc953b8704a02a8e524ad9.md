The National Police Chief's Council has today released the latest set of figures for Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs) given to the public for breaches of Coronavirus Regulations.

The latest FPN figures have been published to the NPCC website, along with provisional data from police forces in England and Wales shows police recorded crime is three per cent lower than in the same period as 2019.

Commenting on the NPCC data released today, Superintendent Mike Walker who is leading the North Yorkshire Police Covid-19 response said:

“We’re at a point in time where it’s crucial that everyone in North Yorkshire takes all the relevant steps to slow the spread of this virus. The choices and decisions each one of us makes right now will have a huge impact on the whole community in the weeks to come.

“We’re really pleased to say that the large majority of the public are following the new guidelines around the wearing of face coverings, social gatherings and the rule of six and we’d like to thank them for their support. However, those who choose not to abide by new legislation should expect police to take enforcement action.

“Sadly it does not take many making poor decisions to undo all the good work and sacrifice the public of North Yorkshire has put in to beating this virus and the police will play their part in not letting this happen.”
