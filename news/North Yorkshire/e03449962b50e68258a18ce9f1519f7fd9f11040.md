Police are appealing to farmers after suspected stolen lambs were found near Thirsk

About 20 of this year's lambs (six months to a year old) were recovered on 24 August 2015. They do not appear to have ever been tagged and are of a Texel or Hampshire Down breed or similar.

Anyone who has any information about the lambs, or who believes they have had any stolen recently, is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police quoting reference number 12150149052.

Earlier this year North Yorkshire Police joined forces with NFU Mutual on a major new livestock theft prevention campaign. For more information about rural crime, and what the police are doing to tackle it, visit www.northyorkshire.police.uk/ruralcrime
