Police are appealing for witnesses to a collision in Harome, which resulted in the death of a male pedestrian.

At 11.06pm on Friday 31 May 2019 a report of a collision between a pedestrian and a red Ford Fiesta car on Acres Lane, Harome near to Helmsley was received by police.

Sadly the pedestrian, a man in his forties from the Stockton-on-Tees area, died at the scene from his injuries.

The driver of the Ford Fiesta, a 20-year-old-man from Barnsley, was arrested in connection with the collision. He has since been released under investigation.

The road was closed in both directions for a number of hours to allow police to conduct a full investigation.

Officers are appealing for anyone who witnessed the collision or the pedestrian or car in the moments before, who have not yet contacted police, to get in touch. They are particularly keen to speak to anyone who may have captured dash-cam footage.

They are also wanting to trace the driver of a dark coloured Range Rover that was travelling on the road at the time, as they may hold information that is vital to the investigation.

Anyone who can help officers with their enquiries is urged to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 1 and ask to speak to Traffic Constable Steven James or Sergeant Julian Pearson. You can also email Steven.James771@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk or Julian.Pearson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

Please quote reference number NYP-31052019-0587 when passing on information about this incident.
