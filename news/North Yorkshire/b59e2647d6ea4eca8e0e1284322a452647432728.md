North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information after a man exposed himself to a woman on a footpath just above Spaunton Quarry.

It happened at around 8.30am on Monday 20 June when a man, who was naked except for a belt around his waist, exposed himself to a female, who was walking on the footpath alone.

The man is described as White, approx. 65 to 70 years-old, around 5ft 3ins tall of large build with thinning hair. He was carrying a couple of cameras with him and was also wearing glasses and a green-coloured sun hat.

At around 9.45am the same morning, as the woman walked back a long the footpath, the man was still there but wearing shorts and a t-shirt.

Anyone with information that could help to identify the man or has any information about the incident is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Sarah Owen or email Sarah.Owen@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk>
