Police investigating a reported rape on a footpath near the University of York on 13 May have closed their investigation. The reportee has confirmed to officers that the events reported did not happen.

No further action will be taken in this case.

Police take all reports of rape and sexual assault seriously and will carry out a full investigation as well as providing support from specially trained officers and partner agencies. The investigating officers were extremely pleased with the response from the public and students following the media appeal and thank everyone for coming forward to help the investigation. We encourage the public to continue to support investigations in this way.

If you are a victim of sexual crime, please do not hesitate to contact the police on 101, or 999 in an emergency. If you prefer not to speak to the police, you can call Bridge House, North Yorkshire's Sexual Assault Referral Centre on 01904 669 339.

If you in immediate danger, always call 999.
