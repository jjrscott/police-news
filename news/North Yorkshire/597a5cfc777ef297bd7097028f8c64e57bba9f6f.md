Police in North Yorkshire have recovered stolen property which was taken during burglaries at two properties in Richmond and Northallerton.

The stolen goods were found at Honeypot Lane traveller’s site in **Darlington** on Monday 25 September, by North Yorkshire Police’s Rural Taskforce, who were assisted by other colleagues from North Yorkshire and Durham Constabulary.

The goods were recovered after police acted on information received from concerned members of the public, and are estimated to be worth between £60,000 and £100,000. Items recovered included various tractor parts, wheels, trailers and galvanized Penn fencing.

Inspector Jon Grainge of North Yorkshire Police Rural Taskforce says:

“We will always follow up on information regarding crime, however small, and will work over our borders, with our neighbouring forces, to disrupt offenders and retrieve stolen property.

We’re absolutely delighted with the results, and that we’ve been able to return all the property to the rightful owners. It’s a fantastic achievement.”

No arrests have been made in connection with the burglaries. Police are asking anyone who may have information which could lead to identifying the criminals involved in the burglaries to call 101.
