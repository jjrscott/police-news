Speaking at the North Yorkshire Local Resilience Forum press conference this morning (Wed 10 March) Superintendent Mike Walker said:

"It's been another busy week for officers, but thankfully we have seen a reduction in the number of fixed penalty notices issued over the last seven days with 210 tickets being handed out.

"Around two thirds of the tickets written over the past week have been to visitors to the region, who have left their homes with out a reasonable excuse and decided to make an unnecessary journey into North Yorkshire.

"As I said last week – we’re on the right path out of lockdown – but we’re not there yet. People are still contracting the virus and our hospitals are still caring for many people who are very ill, so we cannot afford to be complacent.

"I would ask the public to carry on adhering to the rules and continue to stay at home and only leave for necessary reasons, so we can pass the next milestone on the Government's roadmap. Let’s keep going."

Supt Walker also voiced the forces continuing commitment to keeping the public of North Yorkshire safe by saying:

"We’ll continue to patrol and to follow our 4 e’s approach and we will continue to enforce the relevant legislation when necessary, to protect all our chances of coming out of lockdown in line with the roadmap and as quickly and safely as possible."
