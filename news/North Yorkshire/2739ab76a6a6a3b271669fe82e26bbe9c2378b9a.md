An injured tawny owl was picked up by a North Yorkshire Police traffic officer on Friday evening.

He had sadly been struck by a vehicle between Richmond and Catterick Garrison.

Our officer, TC Martin Usher, removed his fleece, wrapped it around the owl and took it back to his office where it then fell asleep between his fleece and shirt.

The owl, which was checked over by a specialist, will remain with the officer over until being re-released back in to the wild.
