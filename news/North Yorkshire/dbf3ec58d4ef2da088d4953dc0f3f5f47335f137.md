In relation to the three assaults on women reported over the course of the weekend (Saturday 3 to Sunday 4 August 2019), which are believed to be related, Harrogate Neighbourhood Policing Inspector Penny Taylor said:

“While incidents of this nature are unusual for Harrogate, I can reassure local residents that we are taking these reports very seriously. Extra policing resources have been deployed to carry out high visibility reassurance patrols in the area and to also support the investigation.

“I’d appeal to local residents who live or work in the Franklin Road, Cold Bath Road and Park Parade areas; if you have seen anyone acting suspiciously in the area, please contact us via 101 and pass that information on. Please quote reference 12190142315.

“I’d also appeal to any drivers who were in the Cold Bath Road area on Saturday night (3 August 2019) between 11.50pm and the early hours of Sunday morning (4 August 2019) who may have captured dash-cam footage, to also contact us.

“We understand that the nature of these incidents will be worrying to local residents, but please be reassured, we are working hard to follow up every enquiry, and doing everything we can to identify and arrest the individual/s responsible for these assaults.”
