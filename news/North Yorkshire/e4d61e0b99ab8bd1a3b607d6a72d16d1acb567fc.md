Speaking at the North Yorkshire Local Resilience Forum weekly press conference, Superintendent Mike Walker emphasised the importance of continuing to stick to the lockdown rules, in order to move safely out of lockdown.

Sharing his concern over the significant upturn in the number of fixed penalty notice's handed out by officers over the last week, Superintendent Walker said "We are not at the point where we can abandon social distancing and all the other precautions we’ve been taking over the past year and just throw caution to the wind."

He again voiced North Yorkshire Police's continued commitment to policing the Coronavirus Health Regulations, stating "We will keep on policing the regulations and taking enforcement action against breaches, we will keep sending out patrols and we will keep engaging with the public , to protect all of our chances of moving out of lockdown as quickly and safely as possible."
