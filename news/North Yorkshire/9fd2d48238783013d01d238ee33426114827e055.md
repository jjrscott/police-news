Police in York have asked antique dealers and silverware collectors to be on the lookout for some distinctive silver napkin rings.

The items were stolen in a burglary in Copmanthorpe near York last year, but it has now come to light that two napkin rings have dates of birth engraved on them, making them easily identifiable.

It is possible that the napkin rings could have been sold on to dealers or collectors and officers are appealing to anyone who may have bought such items or been given them as gifts since 26 November 2020, to check them for an engraved date of birth of 15/01/1963, and get in touch if they believe they have them.

Anyone who may have been offered these or anything similar should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for David Waite. You can also email david.waite@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12200211055.
