North Yorkshire Police is appealing for information after a red kite was found poisoned in woodland near the A64 between Scampston and Rillington.

The bird was found in April 2020 and immediately taken to a vet but unfortunately was in such terrible condition that the decision was made to put it to sleep.

Results have now been received after post mortem analysis carried out by Natural England has revealed the bird died from a lethal cocktail of Brodifacoum and Bendiocarb. Brodifacoum is the main ingredient in rat poison but the analysis revealed that there was no way the bird could have accidentally ingested the substance and as such it was clear the bird had been deliberately targeted.

If you have any information in relation to the illegal use of pesticides in this area or any other information about bird of prey persecution then please contact North Yorkshire Police on 101 quoting ref 12200055801.
