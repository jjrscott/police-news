North Yorkshire Police's Chief Constable, Dave Jones shared his pride as he welcomed 14 new Police Community Support Officers to the front line during a passing out ceremony held at police headquarters in Newby Wiske last week.

Joining from a range of backgrounds including the British Army, the charity sector and HR - the PCSOs will join North Yorkshire Police’s Safer Neighbourhood Policing Teams across the county, where they will work with residents and businesses to tackle some of the day-to-day issues that arise in communities.

Prior to their Passing Out ceremony, which took place on Friday 10 March 2017, the officers completed a comprehensive ten-week programme of training which included a three day community placement to prepare for their new careers.

As well as learning legislation and safety techniques, the course and placement gave the officers a valuable insight local issues and the chance to start building relationships with their local communities.

The PCSOs will be based at Northallerton, Harrogate, York, Scarborough, Stokesley, Leyburn, Richmond and Sherburn-in-Elmet.
