North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses to a serious injury collision involving a motorcycle and an articulated lorry on the A61 at Harewood.

It occurred near Swindon Lane just before 9.30pm on Thursday (19 April 2018) as the blue and white motorcycle was heading towards the A61 from Swindon Lane and the white lorry was heading towards Leeds.

The rider, a 21-year-old man from Leeds, suffered serious head and chest injuries. He was taken by ambulance to Leeds General Infirmary where he is receiving treatment.

The 47-year-old driver of the lorry, also from Leeds, escaped injured but was left shocked by the incident. He is assisting officers with the investigation.

Local diversions were put in place while the emergency services worked at the scene and to allow the vehicles to be safely recovered. The road re-opened at 4.10am on Friday.

Witnesses to the collision or anyone who recalls seeing either the blue and white motorcycle or the white HGV prior to the incident, are urged to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Hamish Halloway.
