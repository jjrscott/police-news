North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses to come forward with information regarding a alleged assault that occurred in York just after midnight on Friday 6 January 2017.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information from a member of the public, who was with a group of others, and who flagged down a marked police van on Bridge Street, close to the end of Ouse Bridge/Riverside Walk, straight after the incident, which left one party involved with a head injury.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for Liz Welburn. You can also email liz.welburn@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12170002746.
