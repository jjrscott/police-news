Police are appealing for witnesses to an assault to contact them.

At around 8.40pm on Friday 5 May 2017 the victim, a 36-year-old man from York, was riding his bike down Wains Road in the Dringhouses area, when he narrowly avoided a collision with a young child thought to be 6-years-old, who was also riding a bike.

The cyclist spoke to the child and then took his bike off the road and pushed it through a nearby gate, when he became aware of a man behind him.

The cyclist was then punched him in the back of the head and was knocked to the floor, where he was assaulted and sustained a broken eye socket, which has since required surgery.

It is believed the offender is aged between 19 and 25-years-old and was with two women at the time of the assault.
