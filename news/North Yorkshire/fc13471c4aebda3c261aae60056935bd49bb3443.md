York residents and businesses are being invited to meet their local police - and raise money for charity - this Friday.

The city's Neighbourhood Policing Team will hold a Macmillan Coffee Morning on Friday 30 September, between 10am and 3pm, in King's Square.

Cake will be supplied by the Macmillan team, as well as by North Yorkshire Police officers, PCSOs and staff, along with contributions from their families and local communities. Tea and coffee will also be available, supplied by Starbucks.

The event is part of Macmillan's nationwide "World's Biggest Coffee Morning" fundraising event.

PCSO Toni Wadsworth said: "This is a great opportunity for the residents of York to speak to their Neighbourhood Policing Team whilst contributing to a very worthy charity and enjoying some cake in the process!"
