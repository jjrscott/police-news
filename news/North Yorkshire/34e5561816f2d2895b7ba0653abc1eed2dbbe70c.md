Officers have arrested two men in connection with the damage of a lorry and the attempted theft of its contents, as part of a proactive policing operation called Operation Cargo.

Op Cargo aims to catch gangs who slash the covers of curtain-sided vehicles and raid the contents, often when the driver has parked up for the night.

At 12.30am Friday 17 January 2020, officers from the Road Policing and Response teams, supported by officers from the Special Constabulary, were carrying out patrols at Barton Lorry Park in Richmondshire, when two men were spotted making off from the location.

As the officers believed they were attempting to evade police attention, a short foot pursuit followed, resulting in the two men, a 59-year-old and a 52-year-old from Morley, Leeds being arrested on suspicion of offences linked to thefts in the area. The two suspects are currently detained in police custody while enquiries continue.

North Yorkshire Police would like to speak with anyone who was in the area at the time who may have seen anything suspicious, or anyone one who has any information which would assist enquiries. Witnesses are asked to call 101, select option 1 and pass the information to the Force Control Room. Please quote reference 12200009183.

If you wish to remain anonymously you can contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
