North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and dash-cam footage after a motorcyclist died in a collision on the B1222 between Sherburn in Elmet and Squires Caf√© Bar, Newthorpe Lane.

It happened just south of Beck Farm, near Sherburn in Elmet, at around 3.44pm on Saturday 24 February 2018.

The collision involved a distinctive green, CCM motorbike that was travelling south from Sherburn in Elmet, and was assisted by other motorcyclists due to a mechanical fault.

The rider of the CCM, a 47-year-old man from Leeds, was taken to Leeds General Infirmary where he sadly died.

No-one else was injured as a result of the collision.

Police enquiries are ongoing into the incident and officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward to assist the investigation, in particular any vehicles that may have passed the group with dashboard cameras in operation prior to the collision.

If you can help, please call North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for the Major Collision Investigation Team or email MCIT@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk. Please quote reference number 12180032781 when providing details about this incident.
