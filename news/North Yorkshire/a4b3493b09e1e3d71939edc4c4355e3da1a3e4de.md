Police have issued CCTV images of a man and a woman they would like to speak to after the theft of electric toothbrushes from a York shop.

On 9 March 2017, two people entered Boots at Monks Cross, York, and concealed two electric toothbrushes, worth Â£270 each, within carrier bags. They then left the store without paying for the items.

Officers would like to speak to the two people pictured on CCTV in the store, as they may have important information that could assist the investigation.

If you recognise them, please contact North Yorkshire Police. Dial 101, select option 2 and ask for PC Rebecca Lund, or email rebecca.lund1826@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Please quote reference number 12170039944 when passing information.
