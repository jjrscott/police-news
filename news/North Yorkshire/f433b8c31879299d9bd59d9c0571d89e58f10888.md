Today, the Police and Crime Commissioner, has announced the future closure of Northallerton Police station.

Commenting on the decision, Deputy Chief Constable Lisa Winward said:

“I am confident this decision is absolutely the right thing for North Yorkshire Police and the communities we serve.

“The decision to close the existing Northallerton Police Station follows the planned move of the public front counter and local policing services at the end of the month, to a new town centre location at Alverton Court.

“In addition, a year-long pilot closure of the custody facilities at Northallerton showed that there is simply not the demand for custody services at the location.

“Following the conclusion of the pilot, the Chief Constable has informed the Police and Crime Commissioner of his decision to not re-open the custody facilities at Northallerton.”

“The arrangements to move Northallerton Police Station’s front counter service to Alverton Court will go ahead on Tuesday, 31 October 2017.There will be no change in the front counter’s opening hours – which remain 8am to 8pm seven days a week.

“The move demonstrates our commitment to be as efficient and effective as we can be and the modern fit for purpose facilities at Alverton Court, enable us to deliver the best possible service to local communities.”
