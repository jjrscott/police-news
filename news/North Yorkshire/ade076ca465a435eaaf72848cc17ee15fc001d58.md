Police are appealing for witnesses to a collision on Chapel Street, Tadcaster.

It happened at about 10.30pm on Friday 30 October 2015, and involved a small silver car that collided with a pedestrian outside the Falcon Pub. A 25-year-old local man sustained slight injuries.

He was treated at the scene by an ambulance crew.

The car failed to stop and left the scene and may have minor damage to its front end.

We are appealing for witnesses to the collision who have not already spoken with the police or anyone who recalls seeing the vehicle prior to the collision, to get in touch as soon as possible to assist the investigation.

If you can help, please contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for John Kendall. You can also email john.kendall@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
