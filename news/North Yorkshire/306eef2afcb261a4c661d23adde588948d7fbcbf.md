Officers investigating a collision involving a 12-year-old girl and a motorcycle in York have arrested two more people in connection with the incident.

A 29-year-old York man was arrested at 8pm on Wednesday 12 June 2019 on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and failing to stop. He has been released on conditional bail.

Two more people have been arrested â€“ a 30 year-old York man and 25 year-old York woman on suspicion of assisting an offender. Both have been released under investigation whilst enquiries continue.

The girl remains in a critical but stable condition in hospital.

To recap, at about 5pm on Wednesday 12 June 2019, police received a report of a serious collision on Low Poppleton Lane, York, involving a pedestrian - a 12-year-old girl - and a motorcycle which left the scene.

The motorcycle, and clothing believed to have been worn by the driver of the vehicle, have since been recovered.

Whilst unable to respond to everyone, officers would like to thank those members of public who have provided information so far which has generated a number of significant leads.

Anyone who has any information that can assist the investigation, including any dash-cam or CCTV footage of the incident, or of the motorcycle, a grey coloured Kawasaki Ninja 600cc, prior to or after the collision is urged to contact North Yorkshire Police.

Please call North Yorkshire Police on 101, quoting NYP-12062019-0335 when passing information.
