Police are hoping to reunite a lost snake in Scarborough with its rightful owner.

Officers were called to a property in Aberdeen Street this lunchtime, where an albino corn snake had slithered into a garden and got stuck.

Such snakes are not venomous. Officers made sure it was safe, and handed it over to the care of the RSPCA.

Anyone who is missing an albino corn snake in Scarborough is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, quoting log number NYP-20052016-0244.
