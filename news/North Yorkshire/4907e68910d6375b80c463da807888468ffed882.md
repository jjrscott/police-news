North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a spate of thefts that occurred in Raisdale.

It happened in Raisdale near Chop Gate between Thursday 28 January 2016 and Saturday 30 January 2016 and involved the theft of two large animal feeders from seperate farms which would have required more than one person to move them.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the public's assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident - especially anyone who saw a 55-plate Ford Transit tipper in white with alloy sides in the area at the time.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for Chris Villiers 1688. You can also email chris.villiers@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12160017340.
