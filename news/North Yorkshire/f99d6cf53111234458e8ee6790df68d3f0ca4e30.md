Police are appealing for witnesses following a violent incident in York.

Just before 4pm on Monday 12 June 2017, a fight is believed to have occurred in the Monkton Road / Elmfield Avenue area of York, involving a number of people. The people involved in the fight are believed to have used weapons, and a local man in his 20s received serious injuries for which he is receiving treatment at York District Hospital.

Officers are appealing for any witnesses in the area at the time who may have seen or heard any disturbances. They also wish to identify anyone seen coming from or going towards the area at the time, who may have been involved or witnessed the events themselves.

A 20-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of affray in connection with this incident. He remains in custody at this time as enquiries continue.
