Police attended reports of protesters in the road on Lendal Bridge in York at 6pm on Tuesday 12 November 2019.

A group of protesters with banners blocked the road intermittently for a few minutes at a time. They left by 6.35pm.

A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: "Our role is to balance the needs and wishes of everyone involved - including the right of those who want to protest safely and peacefully, and the right of people to go about their daily lives without disruption.
