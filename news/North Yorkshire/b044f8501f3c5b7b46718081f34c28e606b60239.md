North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about an assault that occurred in Eastfield, Scarborough.

It happened on Braeburn/Lowfield, Eastfield at 4pm on 7 August 2016 when a 20-year-old woman was pushed by another woman, causing her to fall to the floor and sustain injuries, including a cut to her head.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about the identity of the woman who pushed the victim and a male she was in company with who she was having an arguement with just before the assault.

The suspect female is described as white, 5"6 of large build with blonde shoulder length straight hair. She was wearing a white top with a motif and black leggings and scruffy old trainers. The male was white and shorter in height than the female with skinny build and short brown hair. He was wearing a dark blue denim jacket.
