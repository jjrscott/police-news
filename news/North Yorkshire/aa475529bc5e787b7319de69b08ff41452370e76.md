Three people have been arrested on suspicion of drug and firearms offences in Scarborough on Wednesday afternoon (6 December 2017).

Acting on information, just after 12pm officers attended an address on Cooks Row, Scarborough, where they found suspected controlled drugs and an unlicensed firearm.

The officers who made the arrests and searched the property had been due to police protests at Kirby Misperton, but were redeployed to policing duties in Scarborough earlier that day, due to the safe and peaceful nature of protest activity at the site.

The arrested people include a 22-year-old man and a 21-year-old woman from Scarborough, and a 21-year-old man from Lincolnshire. All three were arrested on suspicion of drug offences, firearms offences and Proceeds of Crime Act offences and have been released on conditional police bail while enquiries continue.

Anyone who has any information about suspected drug dealing in the area is asked to called North Yorkshire Police on 101 and ask for Scarborough Serious Crime Team.

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
