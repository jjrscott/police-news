Two suspected drug dealers have been arrested following a foot pursuit through a Scarborough park.

Detectives approached a man and a teenager who they believed were acting suspiciously at around 1.40pm on Saturday, 17 February.

The two suspects made off through Dean Road Cemetery and into Peasholm Park, where one jumped into the duck pond.

Detective Constable Graeme Boast of Scarborough Serious Crime Team said: “Following a pursuit, the pair were detained with no injuries. However, one was rather wet.

“The park was busy at the time, so I’d like to reassure members of the public who may have seen events unfold that this was an isolated incident.

“Officers acted with the public’s safety in mind, and to reduce any risk that was posed.”

A 20-year-old man and a 17-year-old boy, both from Merseyside, have been arrested on suspicion of class-A drug offences and on suspicion of possessing a knife.

They were released on bail while investigations continue. One of their bail conditions bans them from entering North Yorkshire, except to answer bail.
