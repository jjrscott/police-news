Police are appealing for witnesses to a road traffic collision which occurred on the A170 at around 10.45am Saturday 13 October 2018.

After being requested to stop by police and failing to do so, a green Mitsubishi Shogun was travelling along the A170 west of Thornton-le-Dale in the direction of Scarborough, when it collided with a tractor.

As a result of the collision, the tractor overturned resulting in the tractor driver and a passenger from the Mitsubishi receiving minor injuries. Another passenger from the Mitsubishi received serious injuries and was taken to Scarborough Hospital for treatment.

The road was closed until 5pm to allow a full investigation of the scene and for the road surface to be cleared.

Police are keen to trace anyone who was travelling along the A170 between Thornton-le-Dale and Ebberston, who saw the Mitsubishi Shogun prior to the collision or who witnessed the collision itself.

Please dial 101 and ask to speak to Traffic Constable Mark Patterson or Inspector Dave Barf in the Major Collision Investigation Unit. You can also email Mark.Patterson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk or David.Barf@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

A 29-year-old man from Redcar has been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and failing to stop. He currently remains in police custody.
