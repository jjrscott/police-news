A prolific shoplifter from the Selby area has been sent to prison for 20 weeks.

Stephen Robert Wainwright, aged 38, of Barlby Road, Barlby, was sentenced today (Thursday 5 November 2020) at York Magistratesâ€™ Court having pleaded guilty to five offences of theft and common assault.

The offences were committed in Selby town centre during the past week and he was arrested and charged on Wednesday (4 November 2020).

Wainwright, who will now be spending Christmas in prison, had only been issued with a suspended prison sentence by the magistrates for similar offences on 29 October.

His accomplice in these offences, Luke Owen, aged 31, also of Barlby Road, Barlby, received a six week suspended prison sentence and given a 12 month rehabilitation order.
