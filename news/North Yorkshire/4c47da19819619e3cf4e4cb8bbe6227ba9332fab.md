**Commenting on the latest crime figures published by the Office of National Statistics, Deputy Chief Constable Phil Cain said:**

“As with the figures released earlier this year, North Yorkshire Police anticipated a further increase in recorded crime across the county.

“We are confident this is due to a significant programme of work undertaken to improve our crime recording process.

“The enhanced focus on our crime data integrity followed a Crime Data Integrity Inspection Report from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Service’s (HMICFRS) published in February 2018, which highlighted administration issues.

“We have worked hard to make sure our crime recording process has progressed to the required standard, and although this is reflected by an increase in the figures, I want to reassure the public that we are wholeheartedly committed to continually improve the way we tackle crime.

“This has recently been demonstrated by our commitment to bolster Neighbourhood Policing and our delivery of pro-active policing initiatives such as Operation Servator and cross-border operations.

“In addition, I am pleased to say that the figures, despite the increase, show we continue to be one of the safest counties across England and Wales.”

“It is also important to acknowledge that the figures reflect a continuing pressure on policing demand up and down the country. We will continue to monitor this demand and make sure our resources are where they need to be, when they need to be there.”
