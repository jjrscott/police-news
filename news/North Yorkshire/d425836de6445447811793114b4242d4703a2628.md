Do you know what to do if your car is stuck in snow? Here are some useful tips that you can follow if it happens to you.

• Keep calm: The most important thing you can do is to stay calm so you can properly assess the situation. Don’t spin your tyres, it will only dig your vehicle in deeper.

• Clear space around the car: If you're not putting yourself or other road users in danger, get out and try to dig out any excess snow around the tyres and also the direction you’ll be driving your vehicle out of.

• Straighten your wheels: This will make is much easier for the car to move than if they are turned.

• Get some grip: If you’re not getting any grip, try putting a floor mat in front of the driving tyres (depending on whether your car is front or rear-wheel drive) and gently accelerate again.

Still stuck?: Call your breakdown provider in the first instance before calling 101. In an emergency, or if your car is causing an obstruction, call 999.
