North Yorkshire Police has been assessed as “good” at recording crime and its leadership in relation to crime recording assessed as “outstanding” in the latest Government report.

HM Inspectorate of Constabulary Fire and Rescue Service published its report into the force’s ‘Crime Data Integrity’ on Tuesday 8 October 2019 following a re-inspection in 2018.

Deputy Chief Constable Phil Cain said: “We are pleased that the recent improvements to our crime recording processes have been acknowledged and have resulted in an overall assessment of ‘good’.

“It follows an extensive plan of action that was instigated following the previous inspection in 2017.

“We acknowledge that there are still areas for improvement and as highlighted in the report, these will be addressed as part of the ongoing improvement plan.

“We are satisfied that North Yorkshire Police’s crime data integrity is back on track, and it is very pleasing that we have been able to achieve this while remaining one of the lowest crime areas in England.

“I can assure residents that North Yorkshire Police remains fully focused on tackling crime, protecting vulnerable people, protecting the county’s borders and bringing offenders to justice.”
