Members of the public are being invited to cast their vote, and decide who will win this year's coveted Public Choice Award at the North Yorkshire Police Annual Awards event.

Over the course of the last year, a number of police officers, staff and volunteers have been nominated for a commendation, for demonstrating courage, compassion or inspiration, over and above the call of duty. From these commendations, eight finalists have been selected, and members of the public are now being asked to vote for the individual or team that they want to receive the Public Choice Award for 2016.

The winner of the Public Choice Award will be announced by the Police and Crime Commissioner, Julia Mulligan, at the North Yorkshire Police Annual Awards event in November. The event will also include awards for Lifetime Achievement, and the presentation of the Glenn Goodman Trophy for the most outstanding Special Constable.

Speaking about the vote for the Public Choice Award, Chief Constable Dave Jones said:

"Police officers, staff and volunteers do remarkable things in the line of duty every day, but this is an opportunity to recognise the work of those who have gone the extra mile to serve the public. It is only the second time we have run the Public Choice Award, and last year we were bowled over by the level of public interest and the number of votes we received. I very much hope that this year's stories of courage, compassion and inspiration will capture the public imagination in the same way, and that people will vote in numbers as they did last year. Policing can be a very challenging job, and it means so much to our staff to know that the public support and appreciate their work."

The 2016 Public Choice Award finalists are:

 * PC Xavi Lopez from Harrogate, who prevented two girls from jumping from a railway bridge
 * PC Michael Tinsley from Scarborough, who single-handedly dealt with a double knife threat from two violent and intoxicated women
 * PCs Gregory, Ellison, Harvey, Scott and Churchward, and PSCOs Lewis and Taylor from York, who were first on the scene at a dramatic fatal stabbing incident at a house in Acomb
 * York PCSOs Dowson, Warburton, Harris, Calpin, Martin and Burgoyne who entered a burning building to stop a fire spreading to neighbouring buildings
 * DC Chris Ryan from Selby, who tracked a violent criminal all the way to Costa Rica and negotiated his return to the UK to face justice
 * PCSOs Di Smith and Ange Kaye, based at Catterick Garrison, who worked both on and off-duty to help a woman in severe distress to get the life-saving help she needed
 * Acting DI Steve Menzies from Craven, who has raised thousands of pounds for local youth charities
 * The Serious Crime Team, whose painstaking work secured a conviction in a “first of its kind” landmark manslaughter case

Commenting on the Awards and nominees, the Police and Crime Commissioner, Julia Mulligan, said:

“Officers, staff and volunteers within North Yorkshire Police go above and beyond their line of duty every day to deliver a fantastic service to residents in the area.

"These awards are a great opportunity for the public to pay particular tribute to an outstanding individual who, more than anyone else, they believe has embodied the force's values of courage, compassion and inspiration in the past year.

"Voting is easy and you can do it online. Our force does a good job – often in tough circumstances – and this is a way for people to show appreciation to those who go the extra mile.”
