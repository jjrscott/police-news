Two men have been convicted of night-time poaching, thanks to the vigilance of Watch volunteers in rural North Yorkshire.

Matthew Readman, 33, and Mark Slater, 26, both of West Auckland, County Durham, were fined after being convicted of entering land as trespassers at night with poaching equipment.

Readman was fined and ordered to pay costs totaling £377, and Slater totaling £185. The lamp they were using was forfeited for destruction.

On 3 February 2016, members of the Borderwatch scheme saw lamping taking place on land at Gayles, Richmond. After observations were kept, two men were seen returning to their vehicle nearby. Police officers attended, and they were found in possession of two lurcher dogs and a high-powered lamp.

PC John Wilbor, Wildlife Crime Officer at North Yorkshire Police, said: "This is a great example of the community working together, allowing a good case to be put forward, where the defendants pleaded guilty in court."
