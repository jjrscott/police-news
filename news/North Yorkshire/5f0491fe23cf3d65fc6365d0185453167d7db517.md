A man is due to stand trial charged with an aggravated burglary in a village near Stokesley.

The 27-year-old has been charged in connection with an incident on the evening of 31 October 2019, in which a 69-year-old victim was assaulted in his own home and his car stolen.

Officers immediately attended after the victim managed to escape his home, via the bathroom window, and raise the alarm.

The victim’s vehicle was subsequently recovered in the Eston area of Teesside.

The 27-year-old was arrested two weeks later in connection with the incident and released on bail pending further enquiries.

Following new evidence, he was re-arrested on Tuesday 31 March and appeared at Leeds Magistrates’ Court this morning (1 April) charged with aggravated burglary and theft of a motor vehicle.

He has been released on conditional bail and is due to stand trial at York Crown Court on Wednesday 22 April.
