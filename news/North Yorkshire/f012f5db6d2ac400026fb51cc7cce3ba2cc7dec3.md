Police in the Yorkshire and Humber region have started preparing for a safe and secure Yorkshire 2019 UCI Road World Championships.

Harrogate will serve as the destination town for every race between 21 and 29 September next year and the event consist of nine days of racing featuring locations including Richmond, Northallerton, Tadcaster, Ripon, Wetherby, Bradford, Leeds, Doncaster and Beverley.

The race routes were officially announced at this year’s event at Innsbruck, Austria, on Wednesday evening (26 September 2018).

North Yorkshire Police is leading the regional policing operation which will again see the well-rehearsed and highly-effective collaboration with colleagues from the West Yorkshire, Humberside and South Yorkshire forces working alongside the organisers and other community partners.

Assistant Chief Constable Phil Cain, of North Yorkshire Police, said: “From our collective experience gained from delivering safe and secure cycling events in the region since the Tour de Yorkshire Grand Depart in 2014 and four Tour de Yorkshires, we are confident that the Yorkshire 2019 Road World Championships will be a major success for the region.

“Our operational planning teams and partners have already begun working on the extensive preparations required to ensure the safety of thousands of spectators, as well as the complex logistics to host such an event on public roads and in public spaces while minimising disruption as far as possible.

“With any such large-scale gatherings, public safety and security is of paramount importance. We are doing everything within our power to detect and deter all forms of criminality in the run-up to and during the Yorkshire 2019 UCI.

“We also urge members of the public to be our eyes and ears and to report any suspicious behaviour or activity near the race locations and routes.”

Information should be reported to the police on 101 or call the confidential Anti-Terrorist Hotline on 0800 789 321. Always dial 999 if an emergency response is required.
