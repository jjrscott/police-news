The incident involving a man who climbed onto scaffolding at York Minster has been brought to a safe conclusion.

Police were called at around 5.40pm on Monday 3 August 2015, after the 48-year-old man from Castleford in West Yorkshire climbed up some scaffolding onto part of the Minster roof.

The man claimed to be conducting peaceful protest and came prepared with food and safety ropes. Although he was not associated with any protest group.

For the safety of the man and members of the public, the area was cordoned off while specially trained police negotiators spoke to the man.

He eventually came down form the scaffolding, thankfully without injury to himself or anyone else at around 9.20pm when he was arrested and taken into police custody where he currently remains.
