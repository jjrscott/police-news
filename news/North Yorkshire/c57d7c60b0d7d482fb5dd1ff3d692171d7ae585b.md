Today (Friday 15 March 2019) the media is reporting news of a terrorist attack at two mosques in New Zealand.

Commenting on the potential impact of the news on Muslim communities in North Yorkshire, Temporary Assistant Chief Constable of North Yorkshire Police, Ciaron Irvine, said:

“Although it may be on the opposite side of the world, the impact of this terrible act of terrorism will be felt by people everywhere. As a police force our hearts go out to those who have been affected, their families and friends, and those in emergency services who are dealing with this aftermath of this cowardly attack.

“Here in North Yorkshire we have already been in touch with the mosques in our area to confirm that we will maintain a special focus on mosques and step up patrols in the vicinity as a reassurance measure.

“Meanwhile, I would like to take this opportunity to remind members of the public that everyone can help the police by being vigilant. If you see any suspicious activity you can call 999 or the police anti-terrorist hotline on 0800 789 321.”
