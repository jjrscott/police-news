Police and partner organisations in York are urging people to enjoy summer in the city in the right spirit.

“Don’t let alcohol and drugs ruin your night out” is the message of a hard-hitting safety event in the city centre next month.

On Saturday 8 July, North Yorkshire Police officers will join colleagues from City of York Council, North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service and Yorkshire Ambulance Service to help people understand the impact of drinking and the use of drugs on people’s behaviour in the city and on the roads.

From 3pm on Parliament Street, firefighters and paramedics will demonstrate how casualties in road traffic collisions often have to be cut out of vehicles; while police officers will use ‘beer goggles’ to show how difficult it can be for people under the influence of alcohol to carry out simple tasks like walking in a straight line and how that can put them, and others, at risk.

Later on in the evening, police officers will deploy across the city to ensure people stay safe and behave appropriately. They will also be targeting those individuals who foul streets by urinating in public. Operation Clean, in conjunction with City of York Council will prosecute those who are caught, who can expect to be taken to court and fined.

Cllr Sam Lisle with portfolio for Safer Communities at City of York Council, said: “York continues to be one of the UK’s safer cities and making the city centre even safer is a priority for Safer York Partnership. This campaign will help reinforce the importance of personal responsibility which the vast majority of city centre users recognise. I’m pleased we’re working with licensees, the police, the Business Improvement District and Make It York to achieve this.”

PC Dan Kirven, of York City Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: “The vast majority of people enjoy their nights out in York in good spirits. Unfortunately, those who drink excessively put their own lives at risk – and, if they get behind the wheel, the lives of others too. Those that use drugs and then take the decision to drive are also putting themselves and others in an incredible amount of danger.”

“We don’t want to stop people enjoying themselves and having a good time. But we want to make sure that everyone knows their limits and drink responsibly. I hope the impact of our live demonstrations in the city centre will make people stop and think about their behaviour, and help them get home safely. The use of drugs will not be tolerated and those found to be in possession can expect action taken against them”

“The simple alternative to drink driving is to stick with friends and plan your journey home in advance of a night out. Taxis and public transport are plentiful in York – or appoint a designated driver. All are far better options than a night in a police cell, or in a hospital, having caused serious injuries to yourself or someone else.”
