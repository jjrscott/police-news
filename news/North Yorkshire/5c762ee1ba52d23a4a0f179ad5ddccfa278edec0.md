Two vehicles that may have been used in crime have been taken off the road thanks to close working between local police and volunteers.

On the evening of Thursday 17 January, officers and volunteers on a Mobile Rural Watch patrol spotted two vehicles abandoned in suspicious circumstances in the Appleton Roebuck area, south of York.

The vehicles – a Ford Fiesta and a Renault Kangoo – had been left next to each other, unattended and with collision damage. One was blocking a farm entrance, and checks revealed the other was suspected to be stolen.

Both were seized by police and are now off the road while enquiries continue.

The cars may have been used for driving in fields around the Acaster Malbis area the same evening, and the occupants may have been picked up by other vehicles and driven away towards the Bishopthorpe area at speed.

If you witnessed any suspicious activity at around 10.45pm on the night of Thursday 17 January, contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, quoting reference number 12190010393.

Sergeant Amy Hunter, of Tadcaster Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: “Thanks to the vigilance of Mobile Rural Watch volunteers, and prompt action by Neighbourhood Policing Team officers, two vehicles potentially linked to rural criminality are off the road. It’s highly likely that whoever was using them will think twice before coming to our area again.

“Good work like this goes to show that local residents are the best people to recognise when something is not quite right in their community – and if that’s the case, we’d like to hear about it so we can take action.

“Please report anything suspicious to us using the 101 phone number. Even if it doesn’t need an immediate response, every piece of information helps us build up a picture and could prove vital in bringing criminals to justice.”
