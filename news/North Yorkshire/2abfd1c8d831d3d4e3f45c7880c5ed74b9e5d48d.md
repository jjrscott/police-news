Police were called at about 2.30am this morning to reports of a digger being used to force entry into the front of the Natwest Bank on Main Street, Heslington.

Officers were on scene within three minutes of the call, but the offenders had left in a black Jaguar car, and a cash machine from inside the premises had been taken away on a flat-back truck.

The digger, which was green in colour and had been reported stolen earlier that evening from a farm near the Grimston Bar roundabout in York, was left at the scene.

Extensive enquiries are ongoing to identify those responsible. Officers particularly want to hear from anyone who saw the incident or any of the vehicles involved.

Anyone with any information about the incident is asked to call 101, select option 2 and speak to the York Serious Crime Team, quoting reference number 12150182517, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
