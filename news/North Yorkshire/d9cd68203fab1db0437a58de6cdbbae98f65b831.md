Yesterday's Para-Cycling International was a fantastic event for racers and spectators alike.

The races started in Beverley, Tadcaster and Wetherby throughout the afternoon, with large and enthusiastic crowds along the route, in Harrogate town centre for the race finishes and thousands of people in the fan zone.

Our officers were out in force and there were no serious incidents.

Our priority is to keep everyone safe and sound for the duration of the championships, which close on Sunday 29 September, and we have a multi-agency team working hard behind the scenes.

Chief Inspector Charlotte Bloxham said: “What a great start to what we hope is a fantastic nine days. The races passed without any serious incidents and I would like to thank everyone for making it a safe and fun day. Same again for the rest of the week, please.”

Our dedicated web page northyorkshire.police.uk/lxuyhxzj has more information on how to enjoy the championships and stay safe, with links to race times, routes and road closures that may affect your journeys.
