A suspected car thief who police arrested just half an hour after a vehicle was stolen in York will appear in court.

A Volkswagen Golf was taken from outside a business address in Micklegate, York, at around 7.30pm yesterday.

A North Yorkshire Police safety camera van operator initially identified the stolen car as it passed, and police officers located and pursued the vehicle.

It was stopped a few miles later using the TPAC police pursuit driving method â€“ when police vehicles surround the target vehicle and box it in, then reduce their speed to stop it safely.

A man in his 40s from York was arrested and taken into custody at 8pm yesterday.

He has been charged with taking a vehicle without consent and driving without an appropriate licence or insurance and has been released on bail to appear in court next month.
