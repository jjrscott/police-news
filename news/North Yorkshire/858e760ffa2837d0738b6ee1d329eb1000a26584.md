Detectives are appealing for dash-cam footage, witnesses and the occupants of a white Volvo and truck to come forward following an incident near Farnham in the Knaresborough area in which the driver of a grey van had a substance thrown in his face.

It happened on Farnham Lane between 4.20pm and 4.40pm on Wednesday 25 July 2018 when the occupants of a vehicle, believed to be a dark blue Mazda, followed a grey/black Peugeot Bipper van and collided with it, before throwing a substance into the van driver's face.

The victim was treated at hospital but thankfully has suffered no lasting effects.

In the early hours of 26 July, officers were called to a report of a vehicle on fire in Bar Lane, Knaresborough which is believed to be linked to the incident.

Officers are appealing for information from anyone who was travelling in this area at the time and may have seen either of these vehicles driving in an erratic matter, witnessed the collision, saw anyone acting suspiciously in Bar Lane, or may have dash cam footage of these vehicles.

They are particularly keen to trace the driver of a white Volvo and a truck driver who may have been involved in near-misses with the vehicles involved.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, quoting reference 12180136103 or email sam.harding@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Police believe the incident was targeted and that the wider public were not at risk.
