The collision took place between 11:55am and 12:00pm on Sunday 21 January 2018 and involved a Black Volkswagen Golf and a Black Volkswagen Polo.

The Polo left the scene of the accident before speaking to the other driver or awaiting police arrival.

We are appealing for witnesses to the collision or anyone who recalls seeing the vehicle prior to the collision, to get in touch as soon as possible to assist the investigation.

In particular, we are appealing for information about this Polo, and would be keen to hear from witnesses who were in the area between these times and have dash cam footage.

The driver of the vehicle is described as an elderly white lady, with a male passenger wearing a red beanie hat.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for PC Rout. You can also email 000536@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
