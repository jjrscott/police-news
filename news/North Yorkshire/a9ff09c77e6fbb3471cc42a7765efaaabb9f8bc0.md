North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about two burglaries that occurred in Lothersdale near Skipton.

It happened on Brook Terrace at 17:00-17:10 hours on 25th January 2016 and involved persons who left the properties after being disturbed and left the area in a small silver car. This was parked on Brook Terrace outside the properties and other road users had to slow in order to pass it whilst the offence was taking place.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the public's assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about the silver vehicle or anyone seen getting into the vehicle and leaving the village in the direction of Cross Hills around this time, were you one of the vehicles that had to slow or stop in order to pass the parked vehicle at the times stated?

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for Mark Browne.

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
