North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and dash-cam footage following serious injury collision between a cyclist and a stretch limousine.

The incident occurred on the A19 south-bound junction with the A168 at South Kilvington at around 5.20pm on Saturday (30 June 2018).

It involved a silver Chrysler 300C stretch limousine and a 64-year-old man from the Leeds area who was taking part in an organised time trial.

The rider was airlifted to the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough with life-threatening injuries.

The driver of the limousine, a 27-year-old man from Middlesbrough, is assisting police with their enquiries. He was the only occupant in the vehicle.

Local diversions were in place until around 9.20pm while the police investigated the scene and to allow the vehicle and cycle to be recovered.

Officers are seeking witnesses to come forward along with any motorists or cyclists who may have dash-cam footage of the incident.

Traffic Sergeant Julian Pearson, of the Major Collision Investigation Team, said: “Along with the man who was involved in the collision, we are aware that there were a number of other competitive cyclists riding on the A19 as part of an organised time trial.

“We are appealing to the riders and passing motorists to check their dash-cams for any footage that could assist the investigation.

“We also need to hear from anyone who recalls seeing either the cyclist or the silver Chrysler stretch limousine prior to the incident.”

If you can help, please call North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for the Major Collision Investigation Team. Or email MCIT@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk and quote reference number 12180117447.
