A York schoolgirl has won a cycle safety poster competition organised by officers from the local Neighbourhood Policing Team as part of Operation Shimmer – a road safety initiative to encourage cyclists to light up and be seen.

10-year-old Ava Clarke from Tang Hall Primary School will now see her poster reproduced across the Tang Hall area to help spread the message to cyclists to “be safe, be seen, be green”

Ava was presented with her prize by PC Ryan Innes at morning assembly on Tuesday 17 December 2019. Her prize included a selection box and a set of cycle lights donated by Halfords. Runner-up was Scarlett Stockwell, 10, also from Tang Hall Primary School.

Third place went to Daisy Pierce, also 10, of St Paul’s Primary School. Each were presented with a framed copy of their poster, a selection box and cycle lights.

PC Innes, who organised the competition, said: “We held the competition as part of a crime prevention day at York University to encourage children to get involved in road safety awareness.

“All the entries were brilliant and it was very hard to choose the winning entries. We've got some great designers out there. We want to get more schools on board and hope that this will be the start of a wider competition across the city in the future.”
