A 44 year-old man of no-fixed address has been arrested on suspicion of theft from another person in connection to the investigation into Sonny Ferry’s missing wallet.

The body of 19 year-old Sonny Ferry from Rutland in the East Midlands was recovered at around 12pm on Sunday 14 April following reports that a person had fallen into the river in York.

Following his death, enquires revealed that Mr Ferry’s bank card was used a number of times between 4.22am and 6.10am the same morning to make unauthorised payments for items.

Officers investigating Mr Ferry’s death, which is not being treated as suspicious, are still however trying to establish the whereabouts of his wallet, which is described as dark in colour with a Velcro fastening, and wasn’t with him when his body was recovered.

The man was arrested on the evening of 3 August 2019 and has been released under investigation whilst enquiries continue.
