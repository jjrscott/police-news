North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information following a barn fire that occurred in Gate Helmsley.

It happened on The Lane, Gate Helmsley, at 12.45pm on 12 February 2015, when suspects entered a plot of land and deliberately set fire to a barn before walking away towards Gate Helmsley.

A man seen walking away from the scene was described as stocky, and was wearing a red puffa style jacket, grey woolly hat and dirty dark coloured trousers. The man kept his head down as he walked away.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the public's assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about the man seen walking away from the scene of the fire or anybody else seen acting suspiciously in the area at the time of the incident.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for Stephen Ashley. You can also email stephen.ashley@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk.

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
