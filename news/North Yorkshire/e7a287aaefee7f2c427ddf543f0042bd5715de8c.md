North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information following the theft of a rare electric bike in York.

It happened at 5.15am on Friday 21 January 2017 and involved a man breaking in to the Electric Bike Shop on Walmgate and stealing a Scott E Genius 710 Plus electric mountain bike (pictured) worth £4,600. He was disturbed and left on an old silver mountain bike, pushing the stolen bike alongside him.

The stolen bike is rare and very distinctive. It is a gun metal grey colour and has oversized tyres, wide handlebars, a full battery pack locked to the frame, and fluorescent and light blue flashes across the frame and wheel rims.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the public’s assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we urge anyone who saw a man with two bikes in the Walmgate/Fossgate/Merchantgate area at the time of the break in, or who may know of the stolen bike’s whereabouts, to get in touch.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for Hanneke Hart. You can also email Hanneke.Hart@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12170010938.
