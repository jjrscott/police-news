Scarborough police are appealing to members of the public to help identify a man from CCTV images.

**UPDATE**

Following our CCTV appeal regarding the theft of a belt from Debenhams in Scarborough, officers have traced the man in the images and have established that the belt had actually been paid for and no crime had been committed.

No further action will be taken.

**20 June 2016**

Officers want to speak to the man after a belt was stolen from Debenhams store in the Brunswick Centre on 30 April 2016.

Anyone who can help identify the man is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for PC Michael Barker.

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote reference number 12160074754.
