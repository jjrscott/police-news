North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a road traffic collision on Stockton Lane in York.

The collision occured at 8.30am on Monday 26 October 2015 and involved a small silver hatchback car and a pedal cycle.

A 22 year-old man riding a pedal cycle was travelling along Stockton Lane towards Warthill, over the bridge which crosses the A64 when he was struck from behind by a small silver hatchback.
