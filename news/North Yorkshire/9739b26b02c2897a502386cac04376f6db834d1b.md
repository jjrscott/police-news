Police are appealing for witnesses and information regarding a road traffic collision which occurred on the A64 near Stockton-on-the-Forest at 6.25pm on Wednesday 9 August 2017.

The two vehicles involved, a white Ford Transit van and a silver Citroen C3, were both travelling in the direction of York on the westbound carriage when the collision occurred, which resulted in both vehicles leaving the road and the van overturning on to its roof.

The female driver of the Ford Transit sustained minor injuries and was taken to York District Hospital. The male driver of the Citroen was cut from his vehicle by the fire service and was also taken to York District Hospital with minor injuries.

Police would like to speak to anyone who was travelling on the A64 between the Highwayman Caf√© and Towthorpe crossroads at the time of the collision, who may have witnessed the collision or either vehicle prior to it.

They are particularly keen to speak to the driver of a red Volvo, which was turning right from the A64 into Barr Lane, in the direction of Stockton-on-the-Forest, as they believe they may hold key information which would assist the investigation.

Witnesses or anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, select option 2 and ask to speak to TC Mark Patterson or PC Alicia Oakes. Alternatively you can email Mark.Patterson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk or Alicia.Oakes@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
