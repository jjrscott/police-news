A Skipton man has been jailed for 32 months after hitting a man with a plank of wood.

Simon Nicholas Whiteside, 47, of Greenfield Street was sentenced at York Crown Court on Tuesday 7 February 2017.

On 11 August 2016, Whiteside repeatedly hit a 53-year-old man with the plank down an alleyway in Skipton. The assault resulted in face and head injuries that required hospital treatment including staples and gluing.

Whiteside pleaded guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm and two counts of breaching a restraining order against the victim.

Detective Quita Passmore of Harrogate Investigation Hub, said: “This was a nasty assault that has left the victim with permanent scarring. The sentence demonstrates how serious the courts take such acts of violence and Whiteside now has plenty of time to reflect on his actions. Thankfully he pleaded guilty and spared the victim from a Crown Court trail.

“My thanks go to members of the public who came forward with information about the assault. Their evidence was key in taking the case to court and securing a successful outcome for the victim.”
