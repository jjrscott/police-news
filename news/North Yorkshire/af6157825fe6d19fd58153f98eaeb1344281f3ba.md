Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those caught up in the dreadful incident at London Bridge.

It is an absolute tragedy for everyone affected and we extend our deepest sympathies to them.

While our colleagues in Counter Terrorism Policing investigate the circumstances, this has been a reminder to us all that attacks can take place at any time and without warning. Therefore **it is vitally important everyone remains alert but not alarmed**.

We, along with our partners in the intelligence services, are doing everything we can right across the country to help prevent further attacks. But we need your help. **Communities defeat terrorism** , and we must maintain the strong relationship between the public and the police. We depend on you to be our extra eyes and ears to help keep all of our communities safe.

We advise everyone to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious behaviour or activity to police, in confidence online at gov.uk/ACT. In an emergency always call 999. If you get caught up in the rare event of a weapons attack we urge you to follow the Run, Hide, Tell advice.
