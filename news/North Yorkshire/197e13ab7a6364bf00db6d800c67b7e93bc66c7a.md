More than 500 youngsters from 37 different schools in Craven have benefited from expert safety advice at an interactive workshop.

Craven Crucial Crew has been running for 18 years, inviting young people to attend 'hands on' safety events, giving them the chance to experience potentially dangerous situations in a safe and supervised environment.

Over the last two weeks, from 21 April to 1 May, 570 Year 6 students from schools in the Craven area attended daily scenarios, learning about water safety, the consequences of crime and anti-social behaviour, fire safety, first aid, railway safety, safety in the countryside, advice about drugs, internet safety and more.

The organisations that contributed to Crucial Crew in Craven include:

 * North Yorkshire Police
 * North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service
 * Yorkshire Ambulance Service
 * Craven District Council
 * North Yorkshire County Council
 * IDAS, the domestic abuse charity
 * The Children's Society Hand in Hand project
 * Northern Gas Networks
 * Northern Electric
 * Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority
 * Northern Rail

PC Dave Ridler, of Craven Police, said: "Crucial Crew gives young people an entertaining and informative day learning about how they can keep themselves safe, help others, and help make their local communities a safer place in which to live.

"It's a great day out - fun, but with an important message - and I'm sure it's one they'll remember for the rest of their lives."
