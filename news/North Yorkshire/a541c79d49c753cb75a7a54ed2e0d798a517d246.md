Communities on Yorkshire's East Coast have been given a Christmas boost thanks to a charity collection from police in Eastfield.

Officers, PCSOs and staff at Eastfield Police Station clubbed together as part of Operation Cracker to collect non-perishable foods, household items, cosmetic items, children’s selection boxes, sweets, boxes of biscuits and mince pies for the most vulnerable members of the community.

Organiser PC J-S Coleman, of Eastfield Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: “Sadly, many people see Christmas as a time of hardship, deprivation and poverty whilst struggling to make ends meet .

“This year we also have those who have lost their jobs due to the Covid-19 pandemic, not forgetting the elderly and most vulnerable in the communities we work in. For this reason, we saw this as a perfect opportunity for us to reach out to the community by supporting local charity the Westway Open Arms.”

The Reverend Sam Taylor, Director of the Westway Open Arms, said: “We would like to express our heartfelt thanks to everybody at Eastfield Police Station. This will certainly help our Christmas Appeal for vulnerable people and their families.

“The local police’s support is very much appreciated and helps us to continue to support our local community of Eastfield and surrounding areas in this time of need”.

Operation Cracker was first launched by Filey and Eastfield Police in 2018 as a winter initiative to keep older residents safe during the run up to Christmas and into the New Year.
