North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a silver Vauxhall Astra that was involved in a pursuit with police.

The pursuit began in Sutton-in-Craven and finished on Hainworth Road, Keighley shortly after 2pm on Monday.

We are particularly keen to hear from the driver of a silver Landrover that had an exchange with the driver on Ellers Road, Sutton-in-Craven and the driver of an oncoming vehicle on Goff Well Lane, Keighley who narrowly avoided a collision with the Astra.
