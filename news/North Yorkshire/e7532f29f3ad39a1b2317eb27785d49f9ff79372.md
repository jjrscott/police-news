We have today sent out communication to all those currently signed up to receive our Community Messaging alerts to let you know that we are moving to a new platform. This will mean you will need to sign up again to continue receiving alerts and can do so at our website here: Community Messaging - North Yorkshire Police | North Yorkshire Police or by visiting the North Yorkshire Community Messaging website at: www.northyorkshirecommunitymessaging.co.uk

Please be assured the message you have received is not a scam, a copy of the message sent out is below:

_**North Yorkshire Community Messaging is moving!**_

_We’re making some improvements to the service we deliver to you through Community Messaging and as part of this we are moving to anew system which requires you to sign up again._

_All you need to do isclick here and re-register to ensure you continue receiving our alerts. It’s essential you do this otherwise you won’t be kept up to date with the latest crime appeals, scam alerts and policing work in your local community._

_Our current system will cease on 31 st March 2021 and there will be a short pause in the alerts we send out whilst we get everything ready on the new system but you can keep up to date with your local policing team through their social media accounts which you can find here._

_Thank you for your understanding whilst we make these important changes._
