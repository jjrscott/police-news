Police have issued CCTV of a man they would like to speak to in connection with a burglary near Malton.

An inn was broken into in Appleton-le-Street on 14 March 2017, at about 3am. A window was forced and money stolen from inside.

The premise had CCTV which showed two suspects outside the premises. Images were also captured from inside the premises.

A number of other similar offences occurred in the area on the same night.

Despite extensive enquiries since then, the suspects have not been identified.

Officers would like to speak to a man captured on CCTV at the inn, as he may have important information that could assist the investigation.

If you recognise him, please contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for PC Nicholas Ham, or Malton Police. Alternatively, email nicholas.ham@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk. If you wish to remain anonymous, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. Please quote reference number 12170042969 when passing information.
