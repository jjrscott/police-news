Police are appealing for witnesses to a collision on the A1079 on Monday 4 April 2016.

At about 10.50am, a vehicle described as a large heavy goods vehicle (HGV) was exiting the caf√© layby on the A1079 at Dunnington, turning right towards York, when it was unable to make the turn fully.

The HGV reversed and collided with a white Peugeot Partner panel van which was also leaving the layby. The HGV did not stop and continued towards York.

The collision caused extensive damage to the offside of the Peugeot van, leaving its driver - a woman in her 60s - very shaken.

TC Roger Walker, of North Yorkshire Police's Roads Policing Group, said: "Other motorists travelling into or out of York on the A1079 around the time of the collision may have been held up by the HGV's manoeuvre. I would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the collision, or may have seen the HGV around the time of the incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police by dialling 101, selecting option 2 and asking for Roger Walker, or emailroger.walker@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk.

Please quote reference 12160057889 when passing information.
