Two men and a woman from Scarborough are due to appear in court accused of committing an offence under new legislation brought in because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The incident occurred on the town’s Blenheim Terrace at around 7pm on Wednesday 22 April when police were called to a report of a group of people causing ASB and consuming alcohol.

When officers arrived at the scene, it is understood that some of the group left when directed whilst some refused, and two men and a woman were arrested.
