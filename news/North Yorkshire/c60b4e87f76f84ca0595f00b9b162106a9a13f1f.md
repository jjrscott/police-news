North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and any information about several theft offences that occurred in York city centre over the weekend.

The thefts occurred in several pubs, bars and nightclubs over the weekend of 30 January to 1 February 2015.

The offenders targeted mobile phones, purses and expensive coats.

We would like to remind everyone not to leave any property unattended as this makes it easier for the thieves.

Please report any suspicious activity to security staff or contact the police immediately

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for Andrew Thompson. You can also email andrew.thompson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
