Following ongoing, widespread publicity surrounding allegations of non-recent child sexual abuse within footballing, North Yorkshire Police can confirm that it is one of the forces that has been contacted by the national Operation Hydrant in relation to non-recent sexual abuse allegations in the North Yorkshire area.

We urge anyone who has been a victim of sexual abuse and anyone else with information, to please contact their local police on 101, regardless of how long ago it happened. If you are in immediate danger, always call 999.

Operation Hydrant will continue to coordinate all responses nationally and those cases where there is a live risk of threat or harm will be prioritised for action by forces.

North Yorkshire Police is not in a position to release the number of reports/referrals as these are being coordinated by Operation Hydrant.
