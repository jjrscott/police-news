Scarborough Borough Council and North Yorkshire Police are advising people to give Scarborough beaches a miss on Bonfire Night due to expected adverse tide and weather conditions, and instead, enjoy one of the organised events taking place elsewhere in the town and neighbouring communities.

A combination of a high tide due at 7.30pm, together with a forecasted strong northerly wind, is expected to result in high waves submerging beaches and overtopping onto seafront roads in both North Bay and South Bay. While the conditions are not expected to be any different to the usual high tide activity, which regularly occurs along the Yorkshire coast during late autumn and winter, it is set to put those who normally enjoy informal bonfire gatherings with friends and family on both beaches at risk, and ultimately wash away any carefully built bonfires before they are even lit.

As well as both beaches, conditions could also result in wave overtopping onto Royal Albert Drive, Marine Drive, Foreshore Road and the approach road to Scarborough Spa, as well as the North Bay Promenade. People that are planning their celebrations at the North Bay chalets are therefore also advised to change their plans for the evening to avoid getting into difficulties.

The council and the police will monitor the wave action during the course of the late afternoon and evening tomorrow and if necessary will work with North Yorkshire County Council to ensure any necessary road closures are put in place.

No flood warnings have been put in place by the Environment Agency for the Scarborough stretch of the coastline and therefore no properties are deemed to be at risk of flooding. All seafront businesses will be open as normal.

Nick Edwards, Scarborough Borough Council Director said: “We never like being the bearer of disappointing news, but it would be wrong of us not to act on the tidal and weather information we’ve received and pass that on to those who are planning their annual Bonfire Night celebrations. People’s safety is our biggest concern, but we also want to save those dedicated bonfire builders, who start their preparations earlier in the day, the effort and potential embarrassment of returning to find their creations have been swept away by the incoming tide.

“Organised events taking place elsewhere are often held in aid of worthy charities, so I would encourage people to go along to those instead, stay safe, have a great time and support the good causes.”

North Yorkshire Police Inspector Graeme Kynman, based in Scarborough added: “It is a real shame that what is a regular Bonfire Night pastime for many Scarborough locals and visitors will this weekend be a non-starter due to Mother Nature. We urge people to act on our advice, stay away from the areas at risk and also pay attention to any road closure signage or directions from officials on the ground. We will be working together with the council and other partners for your safety, so please help us to help you.”

The organised bonfires taking place in Scarborough and elsewhere on the Yorkshire coast this evening and on Bonfire Night itself are:

**Friday 4 November 2016**

 * McCains bonfire and firework event, Cayton
 * Fireworks display, Bridlington Rugby Union Football Club

**Saturday 5 November 2016**
