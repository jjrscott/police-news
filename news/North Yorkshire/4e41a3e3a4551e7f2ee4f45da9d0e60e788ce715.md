Police were called at about 3.15pm yesterday, Thursday 17 September, to a report that a 13-year-old girl had been approached by two men in a white van in Clotherholme Road, Ripon.

Officers attended the scene and immediately began a search of the area. At about 4.20pm, a white Ford Transit van was stopped on the A61.

Four men in the vehicle, aged 36, 26, 22 and 20, and from the West Yorkshire area, were arrested on suspicion of attempted kidnap and conspiracy to kidnap. They remain in custody at this time.

Officers are investigating whether this incident is linked to a separate report involving a 10-year-old boy on Lead Lane, Ripon, on Saturday 12 September.

Police have increased patrols in the Ripon area to provide reassurance to local communities, and extensive enquiries are ongoing into these incidents.

Anyone with information about either incident is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police. Dial 101, select option 2 and ask for Harrogate Serious Crime Team. Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.
