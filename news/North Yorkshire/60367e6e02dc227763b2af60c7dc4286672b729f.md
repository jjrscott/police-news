The prompt actions of police officers and a member of the public have saved a woman from drowning in the River Ouse in York.

A member of the public called North Yorkshire Police with concerns about a woman in a distressed state by the river on King’s Staith, just after 1am on Monday 5 June 2017.

Two officers from North Yorkshire Police’s Firearms Support Unit were nearby as the call came in, and were at the scene within nine minutes.

As they arrived, the woman had entered the water and was fully submerged. One of the officers immediately sprinted to a nearby jetty. From there, he and the member of the public who had called 999 were able to pull the woman to safety.

She was taken by ambulance to York District Hospital to receive the care she needs.

Superintendent Adam Thomson, Neighbourhood Policing Commander for York and Selby, said: “Faced with difficult circumstances, officers and the member of the public acted swiftly and decisively. Without their prompt action, this situation could have turned out much worse.”
