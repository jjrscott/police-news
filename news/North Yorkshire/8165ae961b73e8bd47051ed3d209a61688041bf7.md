Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward following a knifepoint robbery in Harrogate yesterday evening.

At around 5.40pm on Monday 29 June 2015, officers were called to a report of a robbery at Number One Shop, Electric Avenue, Harrogate.

A man armed with a knife threatened staff and made off with a quantity of cash. He fled the scene on foot along Skipton Road, heading towards Ripon Road.

No one was physically injured during the incident, but the shop staff were left extremely shaken.

The suspect is described as white, around 6ft 2ins to 6ft 3ins tall and of slim build. He was wearing some kind of dark facial covering and dark clothing.

Police need to hear from anyone who was in the area around the time of the incident, may have seen the suspect, or has any information that could assist the investigation. Please dial 101, select option 2, and ask for Harrogate Serious Crime Team. If you would prefer to remain anonymous, information can be passed to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12150109671.

A 25-year-old man has been arrested in connection with this incident. He remains in police custody at this time.
