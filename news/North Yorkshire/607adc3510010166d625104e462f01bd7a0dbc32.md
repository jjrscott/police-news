Police in Filey responded to an increase in visitors to the coastal town yesterday with a mobile engagement point.

Officers spent half an hour on Muston Road on the afternoon of 5 May, speaking to people travelling into town to ensure no-one was taking an unnecessary journey and putting peopleâ€™s lives at risk.

Five vehicles were stopped and four of those had legitimate reasons to travel. However one of the vehicles was required to be searched and subsequently resulted in the arrest of the driver.

The driver, a 42 year old man from Hull, was arrested on suspicion of possession of cannabis and driving under influence of drugs. Two penalty tickets for breach of Coronavirus Regulations were also issued because the man and a female adult passenger were travelling from Hull with two children in the car, to walk the dog on Filey beach.

The man has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

For future updates the reference number is 12200074664.
