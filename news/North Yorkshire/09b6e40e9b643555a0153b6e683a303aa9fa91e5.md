On 1 April 2020, a member of the public reported finding a dead badger on land close to All Saints Church in Farnley, North Yorkshire.

If anyone has information that could help in our investigation to understand the full circumstances that led to this badger’s death then please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference number: 12200053900.
