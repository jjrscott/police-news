Local government electors have a right to inspect the accounts of their Chief Constable. This right can be found in the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014 (‘the Act’).

The Act provides local government electors with the right to inspect and make copies of the statement of accounts for the financial year ended 31 March 2017 [Section 25].

The Act also provides any persons interested, or any journalist, with the right to inspect the accounting records and all related documents for that financial year [Section 26].

**These rights may be exercised from 1 July 2017 to 11 August 2017 between 9.30am and 4.30pm at Police Headquarters, Alverton Court, Crosby Road, Northallerton DL6 1AA.**

If you wish to inspect the accounts, please inform Jane Palmer, Chief Constable’s Chief Finance Officer (collar number 4364), of your intention to exercise your rights.

Jane Palmer can be contacted or by email to jane.palmer@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk or via 101 (dial 101, press option 2 and use the full name or collar number. If using the collar number, please state each digit individually).

Under the Act, a local government elector may also question the auditor about the accounting records for the same financial year [Section 26] and, may make an objection [Section 27] to the auditor if it concerns:

 * a matter in respect of which the auditor could make a public interest report (under section 24 of the Act); or
 * an item of account in respect of which the auditor could apply for a declaration that the item is unlawful under section 28 of the Act.

**These rights may be also be exercised from 1 July 2017 to 11 August 2017.**

Any requests to question the auditor and any objections must be made in writing to the auditor to the following address:

Mazars LLP

Salvus House

A copy of any objection must also be sent to the Chief Constable of North Yorkshire at North Yorkshire Police Headquarters, Alverton Court, Crosby Road, Northallerton DL6 1AA.
