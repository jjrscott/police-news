North Yorkshire Police traffic cops and a dog unit were involved in the dramatic arrest of a van theft suspect from West Yorkshire.

At 1.33am today (Tuesday 1 September 2020), West Yorkshire Police passed on an alert that a white Ford Transit - stolen from the Kippax area of Leeds - was heading north on the A1(M) though North Yorkshire.

Traffic cops spotted the vehicle at 1.55am as it travelled across the Durham border where Durham Constabulary were moving in to assist.

However, it turned back towards North Yorkshire and an operation was carried out to safely stop the van close to a petrol station at Skeeby, near Richmond.

The suspect ran from the van before applying the handbrake, which then rolled into one of the patrol cars causing minor damage.

A police dog was then sent into a nearby field and the man was located and arrested at 2.10am on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle and driving while disqualified.

He has been transferred into the custody of West Yorkshire Police and is being held for questioning.

The stolen van has been recovered and will be returned to its owner once forensic examinations have been completed.
