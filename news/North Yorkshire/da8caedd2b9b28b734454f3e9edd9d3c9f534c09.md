Police have issued a CCTV image of two men they would like to speak to in connection with an attempted theft in Settle.

At about 3.55pm on Wednesday 1 March 2017, two men entered the Co-op store in Settle. They moved a number of bottles of gin, and placed one in a ruck sack. When challenged by staff, the men put the bottle back and left the store empty-handed.

Police would like to speak to the men pictured on CCTV, as they may have important information that could assist the investigation.

Anyone who recognises them should contact North Yorkshire Police. Please dial 101, select option 2, and ask for PC David Burgess or Settle Police, or email david.burgess@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Please quote reference number 12170035133 when passing information.
