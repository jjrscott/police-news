The first session of a new fitness programme for young people in Boroughbridge and Knaresborough has been a huge success.

Local police in Boroughbridge and Knaresborough have set up a boxing and powerlifting club for young people. The first boxing session on Monday 3 September saw a fantastic response from local young people.

Organiser, Police Community Support Officer Jak Bell, said: "We far exceeded the number of young people we expected and they all enjoyed it and put in a huge amount of effort. I would like to thank the youngsters for making it such a great success and the owner of Absolute Fitness for the opportunity to make it happen. Due to the high demand, there will be a need to book future sessions in advance. You can do this by calling the gym on 01423 323241"

Officers have teamed up with the owners of the Absolute Fitness Gym in Roecliffe to provide the regular sessions for local youngsters.

“There’s not a great deal of activities for young people in the area and want to give local kids a place to go to focus their energies on, rather than hanging around the streets. My thanks go to the owner of Absolute Fitness for his support with the clubs and the opportunity to give local youngsters a sporting chance. Anyone who is interested in joining should simply come along to either of the first sessions, or both if they wish.”

The sessions are open to 13 to 18-year-olds and will cost £5 per night.

The first boxing session will be held on Monday 3 September at 7pm and the first powerlifting session will be at 6pm on Thursday 6 September at 6pm, both will be held at Absolute Fitness in Roecliffe.
