Police have been called to reports of an overturned lorry containing livestock on a junction of the A1 near Richmond.

Around 40 cows were in the wagon when it toppled on the junction 56 roundabout near the village of Barton at around 5.15pm today (Friday, 15 July 2016).

Unfortunately some of the cattle have been badly injured and some have died.

A local vet has been called and some of the injured animals have been put down to prevent them suffering further.

Police are not currently able to confirm the exact number of cows that have died.

No other vehicles are believed to be involved and the lorry driver has not been injured.

Police attended the incident with firefighters and the RSPCA. Several local farmers have also helped at the scene.

The roundabout is currently closed and traffic is being diverted while officers deal with the incident but the road is expected to be reopened later this evening.
