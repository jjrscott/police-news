We love hearing about random acts of kindness, whether its hearing about a wonderful member of public who has helped others in their time of need or finding out one of our officers has gone beyond the call of duty.

Even the littlest things like smiling to a passer-by, holding a door open or bringing some biscuits into work can make a small difference to someone elseâ€™s day.

To help celebrate all the small acts that often go unnoticed, here are just some of the things that have put a smile on our face.

 1. **This little chap was found injured by one of our officers and kept warm inside our officers at until the RSPB could come and collect him later that day**

**2\. Following the tragic event that took place in Westminster last year our officers in Harrogate received this lovely gesture from a member of the public**

**3\. We loved these 'thank you' messages from pupils at Greatwood School, Skipton, to PCSO Amy Sharrad, who was starting her training as a PC later that week**

**4\. One of our PCSOs was on her way out of Embsay one day when she came across two members of the public stood in the pouring rain, helping a man who needed medical attention before emergency services could arrive**

**5\. PCSO Simpson took some time out of her day to put a smile on the face of one of our newest recruits**

**6\. This teddy bear was donatedby PC Beckwith who delivered it in a specially marked 'POLICE BEARS' van with Mr Bear riding up front for a fundraising event in memory of retired DCI Nigel Boynton, who sadly lost his battle with cancer the year before.**
