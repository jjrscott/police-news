North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about some damage that was caused to a vehicle in Norton.

The incident took place sometime on Wednesday 8 February 2017 during which damage was caused to a blue Vauxhall Corsa.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident. In particular, we would like to speak to the driver of a small white van, described as having sliding side doors and blue writing on the side, which was believed to have been following a blue Vauxhall Corsa on Mill Street, Beverley Road and Hambleton Road at those times.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation, or help us to identify the owner of the van, should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for Louise Neville-Beck. You can also email louise.neville-beck@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
