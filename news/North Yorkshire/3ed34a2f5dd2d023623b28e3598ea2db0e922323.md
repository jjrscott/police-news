It happened near to the junction of Aucuba Close, and Alder Way, New Earswick, at 3.30pm on Wednesday 1 February 2017. It involved an 11-year-old schoolboy who was cycling home from Joseph Rowntree School, when an unknown vehicle shunted his cycle from behind, causing him to fall off his cycle.

He sustained minor injuries, scrapes and bruising, as a result of the collision.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about how this incident occurred, and also to identify any other persons involved, as the driver of the vehicle failed to stop at the scene of the collision.
