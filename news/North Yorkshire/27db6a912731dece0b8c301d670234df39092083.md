Police are appealing for witnesses and information surrounding a robbery in York shortly before 7pm yesterday (Monday 11 December 2017).

The incident happened along the cycle path between Lendal Bridge and Bright Street, at the Leeman Park end.

The 21 year old male victim was approached by another man who threatened him with a small blade. The offender took the victimsâ€™ wallet and phone. The offender is described as being in his late twenties to early thirties, of stocky build wearing a grey hoodie.

At this time, police do not believe this incident is linked to the attempted robbery near Fulford Road primary school yesterday evening.

Anyone who witnessed the incident, or anyone who was in the area at the time, is asked to contact police on 101. Press option 1 and pass information to the force control room.

Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Please quote reference number 12170221440 when passing on information about the incident.
