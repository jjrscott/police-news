North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information following significant criminal damage on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway.

Overnight, between 10pm on Saturday 22 July 2017 and 7am on Sunday 23 July 2017, seven train carriages at Pickering Train Station were smashed, both inside and out. Windows were smashed and offenders then trashed the inside of the carriages.

Inspector Martin Dennison said:

“What has been a busy and enjoyable weekend for all those involved in the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, has now been overshadowed by this mindless act of vandalism.

“There is understandably a feeling of anger and outrage amongst the community and police are determined to find those responsible and bring them to justice.

“Anyone who has any information or who witnessed or heard anything suspicious or unusual overnight in the Pickering area is asked to call police.”

Dial 101, press 1 and pass information onto the force control room.

Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Please quote reference number 12170129575 when passing on any information.
