Police have arrested a suspected drink driver, after the white BMW 3-series he was driving collided with a police car in Acomb.

Police were alerted to the car driving at speed through York city centre, with the passenger door open, at 2.40am Thursday 15 February 2018, heading the direction of Acomb.

The vehicle was then located driving on the wrong side of the road near Acomb Green. Police instructed the driver to stop the vehicle, but he failed to do so - hitting a police car and causing damage to the front left wing and bumper, as he left. The BMW was then sighted heading in the direction of Danebury Drive.

Police continued to search the area for the car and at 4am, both the vehicle and driver were found parked outside some shops on Bramham Road, Acomb.

The driver, a 20-year-old man from York, failed a roadside breath test and was arrested on suspicion of driving with alcohol above the legal limit, dangerous driving, failing to stop after a collision, driving otherwise in accordance with a licence and driving without insurance.

He currently remains in police custody.
