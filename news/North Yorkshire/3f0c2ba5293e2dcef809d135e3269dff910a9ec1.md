A team of cuddly teddies to help comfort upset children have joined North Yorkshire Police at this year's Great Yorkshire Show.

North Yorkshire Police's Rural Taskforce is hosting a stand at the event, with its popular police tractor 'Bobby' drawing in the crowds, and the force's Recruitment Team there to promote opportunities to join the police as a Special Constable.

But the event also sees the launch of a large collection of 'Trauma Teddies' that have been donated to the force. Here's one of them!

PC Hannah McPeake, of North Yorkshire Police's Rural Taskforce, said: "This year, we have also brought along a collection of 'Trauma Teddies', knitted and kindly donated by Killinghall Women's Institute. Its members set up a knitting group to knit jumpers for the Tour de France when it came to Harrogate. The group then heard about the 'Trauma Teddy' concept, and decided to start making them."

After their debut at the show, the teddies will be taken out on patrol by Rural Taskforce and other North Yorkshire Police officers, to provide comfort to children affected by upsetting and traumatic events, and help build up relationships with the officers who have come to help them.

PC McPeake added: "Whilst we are hoping we won't need the teddies too often, officers will now have them ready to help any children who find themselves in an upsetting situation."
