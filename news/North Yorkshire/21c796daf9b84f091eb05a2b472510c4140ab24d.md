In the run-up to Anti-Slavery Day on 18 October, North Yorkshire Police and our community partners are highlighting some of the key issues to help tackle modern slavery and human trafficking in our area.

Modern slavery is thought to be one of the most lucrative forms of organised crime, with the International Labour Organisation estimating its global annual worth at £150 billion.

In the UK, there are an estimated 136,000 men, women and children trapped in modern slavery.

Criminals view slavery as low-risk in terms of enforcement and high-reward, in the fact that victims can be exploited repeatedly, generating thousands in illegal profits each year.

Slavery can come in a number of forms, such as:

 * **Forced labour** – working long hours with little money, under threat and in fear
 * **Sexual exploitation** – forced prostitution
 * **Servitude** – being completely subjected to someone more powerful
 * **Forced organ donation**
 * **Forced criminality** – cannabis cultivation, begging, shop theft and drug delivering/dealing

Some industries, such as car washes, nail bars, food packaging and processing, construction, care homes, hospitality and catering, fishing, restaurant and takeaways, are more susceptible to labour exploitation.

In recent years, North Yorkshire Police has been working hard to establish a picture of what modern slavery and human trafficking looks like in North Yorkshire.

Partnership working is very important to building our understanding of modern slavery. Sharing information and intelligence enables a multi-agency response, allowing police to run operations alongside colleagues from the Home Office, HM Revenue and Customs, the **Gangmasters & Labour Abuse Authority**, local authorities and trading standards, and the Environment Agency.

In 2018, the North Yorkshire and City of York Modern Slavery Partnership was established, working alongside the Modern Slavery and Illegal and Exploitative Working Group.

**Detective Superintendent Allan Harder, Head of Safeguarding at North Yorkshire Police, said** : “Understanding and tackling modern slavery and human trafficking is a priority to North Yorkshire Police.

“People mistakenly think that slavery impacts only densely populated, inner city areas. However, rural areas are vulnerable to slavery too and I can assure you, slavery is closer to you here in North Yorkshire than you think.

“Police are fully committed to finding the gangs who target and exploit vulnerable people. However, we need the eyes and the ears of the public to help us in our task.

“Safeguarding the vulnerable in our local community, and society as a whole, is everyone’s business and everyone has a role to play.”

Det Supt Harder added: “If you use hand car washes, nail bars or engage with any of the other industries or services which are susceptible to slavery, please be vigilant for any signs of forced labour.

“Do the employees look ok? Do they seem anxious or fearful? Are they wearing suitable clothing for the task they are carrying out? Do they have any visible injuries? Do they look you in the eye or seem to avoid conversation or contact? Are they brought to and picked up from work?

“If there is anything which raises your suspicion – we want to know.”

**Making a report**
