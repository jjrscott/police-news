Police are appealing for information and witnesses after a burglary in Whitley, near Selby.

At about 1pm on Friday 30 December, a house was broken into on Doncaster Road, Whitley. An unknown offender broke in through the back door, and removed a number of items of property, including Royal Crown Derby porcelain pieces.
