A stolen quad bike has been recovered and a man arrested in connection with its theft from North Yorkshire.

At about 2pm on Tuesday 24 September 2019, a Honda quad bike was stolen from a farm in the Hambleton district, near Stokesley.

The Honda Fourtrax quad, worth about £6,000, had been fitted with a tracker device by its owner.

Later that evening, officers from North Yorkshire Police’s Rural Taskforce, working alongside colleagues from the Tees and Hartlepool Harbour Police, and Cleveland Police, traced the quad to a premises in the Redcar area.

A 35-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of the theft of the vehicle. He remains in custody at this time.

The quad has been recovered for forensic examination, and will be returned to its rightful owner – enquiries into the theft are ongoing.

On Monday, a quad bike at a property near Thirsk was targeted in a separate incident. On that occasion the suspected thieves were challenged by a vigilant resident, and ran away empty-handed.

Police are urging all quad bike owners to take extra precautions to secure their vehicles.
