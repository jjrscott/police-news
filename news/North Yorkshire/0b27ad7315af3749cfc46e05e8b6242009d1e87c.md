Four people have died following a collision on the A64 near Scampston between Malton and Scarborough.

It happened at around 3.40pm on Friday 22 July 2016 and involved a Suzuki Ignis saloon car and a HGV.

The Suzuki was travelling towards Scarborough and the lorry was travelling in the opposite direct when they collided.

Sadly the four occupants of the Suzuki, two men aged 58 and 63 and two women aged 57 and 60 died at the scene of the collision.

Two of the deceased â€“ the 63 year-old man and the 60 year-old woman were from Scarborough, and the other man and woman were from Leeds.

The driver of the lorry, a 26-year-old man, was uninjured.

A second car, a Honda Jazz, sustained damaged from the debris from the collision.

All three emergency services were called to the scene including the fire and rescue service, road ambulance and air ambulance. The road was closed in both directions to allow emergency services to deal with the collision and to allow collision investigators to examine the scene. It reopened early the next day

Any witnesses to the collision and anyone who saw either of the vehicles prior to the crash are asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for Lee Cobb of the Major Collision Investigation Team. Or emailLee.Cobb@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
