The latest North Yorkshire Police webchat will give residents in Stokesley the chance to ask questions about policing, crime and anti-social behaviour in the area.

Inspector David Murray and Sergeant Nick Hill will host the webchat between 12pm and 1pm on Tuesday 17 May 2016.

They will be online to discuss peoples' experiences with Stokesley police and to talk about how the policing service in the town can be further improved.

Inspector Murray said: "Webchats are an excellent way of engaging with our residents, allowing us to address the issues that concern our local communities in a modern, accessible way.

"We will do our best to answer any questions that come up during the webchat. For those who can't attend the online event, there are also plenty of opportunities to ask questions in advance, or meet your local police face-to-face as well."

Residents who are unable to take part in the live webchat are encouraged to send their questions in advance on Twitter, Facebook or email.

 * On Twitter, tweet the North Yorkshire Police account @NYorksPolice, or the Stokesley Police account @MikeOscar999
 * On Facebook, leave a comment on the North Yorkshire Police Facebook page (www.facebook.com/NorthYorkshirePolice) or the new Stokesley Police Facebook page (search Facebook for Stokesley Police)
 * Via email, send your questions todigital@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

A transcript of the webchat will be made available here as soon as the event has finished.
