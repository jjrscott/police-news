Police are appealing for a member of the public to come forward to assist an investigation into a burglary in Harrogate.

A member of the public who was out jogging on the morning of Saturday 28 November found a mobile phone and handed it in to Harrogate Police Station. However, they did not leave their contact details.

Officers are appealing for that person to come forward as a witness, as the phone may be linked to an aggravated burglary, and they may have information that could assist the investigation.

At about 7.30pm on Friday 27 November 2020, police received a report of a burglary in Killinghall. Offenders had entered a property and threatened the occupants, before stealing cash and other items.

A short time later, North Yorkshire Police officers located and arrested two men in connection with the incident. They remain in custody at this time.

If you were the jogger who handed the phone in on Saturday morning, please contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, quoting reference number 12200211798.

Anyone with information that could assist the burglary investigation is also asked to contact police, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
