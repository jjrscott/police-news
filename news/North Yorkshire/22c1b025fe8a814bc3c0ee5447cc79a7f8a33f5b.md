Emergency services in Yorkshire are supporting KickOff@3, an initiative that promotes social inclusion among young people from all walks of life through sport, music and arts.

North Yorkshire Police has organised a 7-a-side football tournament for two age groups (13-14 and 15-16) to be held at York Sports Village on 12 April 2020. The winners will go on to compete in the national finals in London on 28 June 2020. Mixed gender and girls only teams are welcome to take part.

The event is being supported by North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service, which has entered teams from its firefighter cadet schemes and Local Intervention Fire Education (LIFE) course, as well as West Yorkshire Police.

The tournament will also help raise funds for seven-year-old Luke Mortimer, from Skipton. Luke was a keen rugby player who developed meningitis before Christmas and had to have both his hands and legs amputated.

Arfan Rahouf, Positive Action Co-ordinator at North Yorkshire Police, said: “We particularly want to engage with young people from BAME and underprivileged backgrounds. We’re hoping to get ten teams in each age category, so if you want to take part please get your entry in before the closing date of 13 March.”

KickOff@3 was created by Michael Wallace and Ashley Levien. Michael Wallace is a serving police officer who works in Community and Youth Engagement and is passionate about supporting youth and community initiatives outside work, too.

Ashley Levien runs Suberbos Community, which is a social inclusion organisation that delivers free initiatives in the London Borough of Barnet. Ashley has dedicated his professional career, and much of his time outside work, to supporting young people to get involved in activities which they see the benefit of for the rest of their lives.

If you are interested in putting a team forward for the KickOff@3 tournament in York, please email Arfan.Rahouf@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk before the 13 March deadline.

Further information about KickOff@3 is available on their website https://www.kickoffat3.co.uk/ and the fundraising page for Luke Mortimer is available at https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/john-firth
