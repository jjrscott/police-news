A number of schools and colleges in the UK have received threatening emails today - including in North Yorkshire.

An National Crime Agency spokesman said:

“A number of schools and colleges have received threatening emails today.

“We understand these threats have caused considerable concern and are taking the incident extremely seriously, but we would stress we do not assess there to be an increased risk to the public.

“Given that for many schools and colleges it is the last day of the Easter break, some schools may not yet be aware of the email.

“Potential similarities to malicious emails sent to schools since the beginning of March are being considered by an ongoing NCA investigation.

“An 18-year-old men from the Abbots Langley area and a 19-year-old man from Watford have been arrested in that investigation, both on suspicion of offences relating to malicious communications. They were later released under investigation.”
