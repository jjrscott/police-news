Police are appealing for information after the death of a sparrowhawk near Richmond.

Some time during the last week of April 2017, a sparrowhawk was shot at Feldom, Richmond, specifically in the area of High Waitgate, close to the Marske to Newsham road.

The bird was recovered by police and taken to a local vet, where it was x-rayed. The x-ray image clearly shows the pellets from a shotgun that killed the bird.

Wildlife crime officer PC Mark Wood said: "Killing a bird of prey like this is an offence, and I am appealing to anyone who knows anything about this incident to come forward and contact me."

Anyone with information should call North Yorkshire Police on 101, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Please quote reference number 12170073101.
