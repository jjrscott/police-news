Police in North Yorkshire are urging members of the public to sign up to a lifesaving child safety scheme.

Child Rescue Alert is nationwide system, run by the National Crime Agency, the charity Missing People and technology company Groupcall, which has the potential to save a vulnerable child's life.

A major publicity campaign is taking place nationwide over the next two weeks, to encourage more people to sign up for the alerts.

DCI Allan Harder, of North Yorkshire Police, said: "The initial hours after a child goes missing are crucial. A sighting by a member of the public could lead to the safe recovery of a vulnerable child.

"Although thankfully such incidents are rare in North Yorkshire, and fortunately we have never had to launch a Child Rescue Alert in our area, the simple action of registering could help return a missing child home.

"When a Child Rescue Alert is issued, it is sent to thousands of people through text, email, app notifications, social media, digital billboards, and local and national media. This means that many more eyes and ears are on the ground, on the lookout for the missing child."

It costs nothing to register to receive Child Rescue Alerts at _www.childrescuealert.org.uk_. Alternatively, you can text to register by texting HERO and your postcode to 85080. Texts to register cost the network charge.

Once registered, you may not receive an alert for some time because Child Rescue Alerts are issued on rare occurrences and in most circumstances will be geo-located.

You can also receive alerts on social media by following @CRAlerts on Twitter or like the Facebook page at _www.facebook.com/CRAlerts_.

More information about Child Rescue Alert at North Yorkshire Police is available at _www.northyorkshire.police.uk/childrescuealert_.

A Child Rescue Alert would be activated if a child within North Yorkshire, apparently under 18 years old, was perceived to be in imminent danger of serious harm or death, and there was sufficient information available to enable the public to assist the police in finding them.
