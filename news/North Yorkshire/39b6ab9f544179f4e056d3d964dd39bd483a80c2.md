North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a incident of criminal damage that occurred at the fishing lake by the B1222/A162 roundabout in Sherburn in Elmet.

The damage took place between 5pm on Wednesday 18 February 2015 and when it was discovered on the morning of Thursday 19 February.

A substantial amount of criminal damage was caused to benches, platforms, chairs, railings and life belts, with many items being thrown in the pond. The total cost of the damage is estimated to be around Â£4,500.

Police spokeswoman said: "It is beyond belief what anyone hoped to gain from this shocking criminal damage. Vandalising life-saving aids could have serious consequences and the suspects should consider themselves lucky that they did not need them at the time. We urge anyone who knows who was responsible or witnessed any suspicious activity in the area of the pond, to contact the police."

Anyone with information should call North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for PC Martin Temple. Or email martin.temple@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote reference 12150027775 when passing on information.
