In line with the raised national threat level, North Yorkshire Police has responded to the heightened "critical" threat level after today’s attack in London.

The decision follows a review of national security and is in line with other police forces across the UK,

The heightened status was announced by the Prime Minister this evening in light of the incident at Parsons Green Underground Station.

The “critical” threat level suggests a further attack on the UK is imminent.

North Yorkshire Police’s Assistant Chief Constable Phil Cain said: “The threat facing the UK has been raised from “severe” to “critical” following a national review the incident in London earlier today.

“I’d like to reassure the people of North Yorkshire that there is no specific threat identified to the county of North Yorkshire.

“However, given the threat posed following today’s events at Parsons Green, the public are being urged to remain calm but alert.”

Members of the public are asked to report any suspicious activity, behaviour or concerns to police, via the confidential hotline on 0800 789 321 or online at gov.uk/ACT. In the case of an emergency, always dial 999.

A public appeal for images or video footage relating to the incident has been also made by investigating officers. Any images from the scene at Parsons Green, or that may assist the inquiry, should be uploaded to www.ukpoliceimageappeal.co.uk

Support for those affected is available on the .gov.uk website, which provides advice on urgent assistance for victims and witnesses: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/parsons-green-attack-september-2017-support-for-people-affected
