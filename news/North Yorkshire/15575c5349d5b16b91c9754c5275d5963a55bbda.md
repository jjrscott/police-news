A man who broke into a department store while it was closed due to the coronavirus lockdown has been sent straight back to jail.

North Yorkshire Police officers recognised Geoffrey Stuart Dobson on CCTV and arrested him less than 24 hours after he burgled the shop in Northallerton high street.

At about 3.15pm on Wednesday 27 May 2020, Dobson broke into Barkers in Northallerton, which was closed and locked. Inside, he took items of clothing and cycled away – before returning a few minutes later and removing further items.

In total, more than £2,500 worth of stock was stolen from the store, including Armani, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Hugo Boss shirts, t-shirts, shorts, hoodies and jackets.

Clear CCTV footage captured a suspect committing the offence, and his face was recognised immediately by local police officers.

Dobson, 43, from Northallerton, was arrested the following afternoon, and charged with burglary. He had only been released from HMP Hull on 26 May – one day before the burglary took place.

He appeared at York Magistrates Court on Friday 29 May, where he pleaded guilty.

Dobson was jailed for 20 weeks. Magistrates told him the offence was so serious because of his record of previous offending, and because it was committed immediately after being placed on post-sentence supervision.

He was also ordered to pay a £128 victim surcharge.
