Police are appealing for witnesses and information about an assault that occurred in York on Saturday 13 July.

It happened at the disused park and ride site adjacent to the Tesco store in Askham Bar at 1.15pm.

Three males of average height and build, all dressed in black and wearing balaclavas, attacked a 16-year-old boy on his way to the shops.

The victim suffered concussion and was taken to York District Hospital where he was treated for an injured jaw before being discharged.

He is still very shaken by the unprovoked attack and is recovering at home.

We are asking for the publicâ€™s help to establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about a male cyclist who was passing and disturbed the attackers.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Terence Priestman or email terence.priestman@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
