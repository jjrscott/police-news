North Yorkshire Police have released an e-fit of a man wanted in connection with an attempted robbery at a property in the St Benedict Road area of York.

At 8.50pm on Sunday 17 July 2016, the man entered the property, threatened the vulnerable woman occupant and demanded money. The woman managed to call for help and the man fled empty handed.

The suspect is described as white with a dirty face, aged in his 30's, 5’6” tall with a moustache and scruffy beard. He was wearing a long sleeved black hooded jacket, trousers and dark trainers with white soles.

DC Elaine Arnott of North Yorkshire Police said:

"I am keen to speak to anyone who saw a person on Sunday evening matching this description. Whilst the victim was left physically unhurt she remains in a state of shock. I am determined to identify the man responsible for this despicable yet isolated incident."

"I remind everyone to be extra vigilant in the summer months and to keep windows and doors locked where possible. Our Safer Neighbourhood Teams continue to provide reassurance and ongoing support in the area. Anyone with information which could assist the investigation is asked dial 101, select option 2 and ask to speak to York Serious Crime Team. Please quote reference 12160126996.”
