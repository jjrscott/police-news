Police are appealing for witnesses following a serious collision at 10.50pm last night, Wednesday 13 April 2016.

The incident happened on the A1(M), one mile north of Junction 46 for Wetherby, near Kirk Deighton, and involved a silver BMW 320.

The car left the carriageway to its left hand side and collided with fencing.

The driver of the BMW, a 25 year old man from Ripon, suffered serious head injuries and was taken to Leeds General Infirmary where he is described as critical but stable.

The road was closed for five hours while police worked at the scene.

Police are appealing for anyone who witnessed the collision, or who saw the BMW prior to the collision, to get in touch. Dial 101, press 2 and ask to speak to TC 1295 Rob Roberts at Harrogate Road Policing Unit.
