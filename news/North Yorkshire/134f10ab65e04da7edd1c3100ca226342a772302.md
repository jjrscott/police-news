Police in York were called at 8.15pm on Wednesday 21 January 2015 to reports from a member of the public that they believed there was a body in the River Foss near Sainsbury's on Foss Bank.

Officers attended the scene and sadly confirmed that there was a body in the water.

The body of a woman aged in her sixties was recovered from the river by police officers.

At this stage, police are treating her death as unexplained and a full investigation is being carried out to determine how she came to be in the river and the circumstances that led to their death.

The area was cordoned off while police officers examined the scene.

The woman has not yet been formally identified and officers are in the process of contacting her next of kin.
