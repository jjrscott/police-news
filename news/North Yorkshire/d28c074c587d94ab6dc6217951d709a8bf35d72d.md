Police are appealing for dash-cam footage and information following the attempted theft of a cash machine from Sainsbury’s on Stainsacre Lane in Whitby in the early hours of Thursday 19 October 2017.

Officers would like to hear from anyone who saw, or has any dash-cam footage of a grey Volkswagen Golf estate which the suspects used to leave the scene of the crime and the JCB used to try and remove the cash machine from the wall.

The Golf estate left Whitby at around 1.34am in the early hours of Thursday and was north of Scarborough by 1.53am.

A yellow and black JCB was stolen from a farm at High Normanby, sometime after 10pm. It will have travelled down the A171 towards Whitby and was possibly parked in the vicinity of Sainsbury’s prior to the incident.

Officers want to hear from anyone who has seen either of the vehicles in the area or was travelling in the vicinity and has any dash-cam footage of the vehicles to contact them.

Anyone who can assist the investigation is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for the Serious Crime Team at Scarborough, or email Stephen.monty@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
