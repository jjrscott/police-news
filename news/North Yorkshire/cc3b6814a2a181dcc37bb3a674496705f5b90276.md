The public are being asked to decide which of nine outstanding finalists best embodies the positive values of North Yorkshire Police.

Julia Mulligan, the Police and Crime Commissioner for North Yorkshire, has sponsored the Public Choice Award, to raise awareness of the courage, compassion and inspiration shown by officers, staff and volunteers, which is often over and above the call of duty.

The finalists facing the public vote include:

•PC Richard Baranovsky from Harrogate, who chased down a town-centre knifeman, who was carrying an eight-inch blade.

•PC Suzanne Asquith from York, who despite her own illness has launched two inspirational projects for young people across the county

•PC Mark Reed from Richmond, we entered a house alone to save a highly distressed woman wielding a knife from a suicide attempt

•Police Community Support Officer Jason Lloyd from Northallerton, who has championed the needs of people with learning difficulties, and built better relationships between people with disabilities and the police

•Staff member Antony Byrne from York, who responded to cries for help to play his part in a river rescue

•Detective Constable Jeremy Pratt from Scarborough, who has been recognised for the support he provides to victims' families in complex murder cases

•Sergeant Ed Simpson from Harrogate, who is leading the way in breaking down taboos about mental health in the emergency services

•Representatives from the Serious Crime Team, who have been praised by families for their sensitive handling of child abuse cases

•PC Peter Henderson from Thirsk, who has a record number of arrests to his name, and who is tackling theft head-on in his local community

Commenting on the Awards and nominees, the Police and Crime Commissioner, Julia Mulligan, said: "This is the first time that we have had a Public Choice Award as part of the Annual Award Ceremony, and I urge the public to get behind it and show their support by voting. The public have already played their part by nominating people for awards, but their input at this stage is invaluable. It is very easy to do online, and having spoken with so many officers, staff members and volunteers through my role as Commissioner, I know just how much public support means to the people who work at North Yorkshire Police. There are always things we are looking to improve, but the police do a good job - often in tough circumstances - and this is a way for the public to show their appreciation to those who go the extra mile."

Commenting on the Public Choice Award nominees, North Yorkshire Police's Chief Constable, Dave Jones, said: "People who work at North Yorkshire Police do outstanding things every day, but these nine nominees really do demonstrate the values of courage, compassion and inspiration that we stand for as an organisation. The Public Choice Award is a great way for us to showcase the work of North Yorkshire Police - which is often broader than people expect."

Voting closes at midnight on 9 October.

The Award will be announced at a special Annual Awards ceremony in York on 23 October, which has been completely funded by the generous support of sponsors CGA, Dell, the Police Federation, the High Sheriff of North Yorkshire, the National Association for Retired Police Officers, UNISON and Fight Fit Combat Fitness.
