A large number of tyres (approximately 200) were dumped at the Brockadale Nature Reserve car park in Little Smeaton, sometime overnight between 4 and 5 February 2020.

Anyone with information about this incident of fly-tipping is asked to contact Selby District Council on 01757 705101.

A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: “Fly-tipping tyres like this is a selfish crime that blights the local environment and spoils people’s enjoyment of our countryside – and in particular this wonderful nature reserve.

“Fly-tipped rubbish is a source of pollution, a potential danger to public health and a hazard to wildlife. It also undermines legitimate waste businesses that operate within the law.

“We are working really closely together with local authorities and landowners to tackle this issue here in North Yorkshire. But we also need help from the public – if you find or witness fly-tipping, wherever it is, record as many details as you can and report it to your local authority or via the gov.uk website. This will help the authorities take action against those responsible and stop them fly-tipping in the future.”
