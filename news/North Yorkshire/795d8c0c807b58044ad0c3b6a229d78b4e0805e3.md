We are appealing for information after a man was found unconscious with serious head injuries on the road between Askrigg and Newbiggin in Wensleydale.

At around midnight on Saturday 8 April 2017, the 22-year-old local man left the White Rose pub in Askrigg on foot and was found injured a short time later (in the early hours of Sunday) on the road leading to Newbiggin.

He was taken to James Cook Hospital in Middlesbrough where he remains in a serious condition.

Police need to piece together the manâ€™s movements from leaving Askrigg to being found in the road and are appealing to anyone who was the area around midnight on Saturday night, or was traveling along the Askrigg to Newbiggin road, to contact them.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask or Northallerton Serious Crime Team or email _christopher.parker-beagrie@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk_
