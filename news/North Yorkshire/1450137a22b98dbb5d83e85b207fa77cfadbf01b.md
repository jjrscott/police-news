A 20 year old man from Hutton Rudby and a 26 year old man from Stokesley were arrested after North Yorkshire Police responded to a report of stolen car batteries on Wednesday morning (15 July 2020).

Shortly before 8am on 15 July 2020, police received reports of suspects spotted stealing batteries from a commercial garage in Northallerton. The quick-thinking reportee was able to provide the registration number of the vehicle in which the suspects had left the scene and it was soon identified by officers travelling between the A19 and Hutton Rudby.

A pursuit followed, before the driver and passenger abandoned the vehicle and made off across a nearby field. Officers were able to contain the area whilst calls were made for aerial support from NPAS (National Police Air Service) and the Police Dog Unit.

A keen-nosed police dog was able to track the suspects to two separate addresses near Hutton Rudby where they were arrested on suspicion of theft. Following a search, several stolen batteries were recovered, as well as a quantity of cash at one of the properties and in the field through which they had run from the vehicle.

Both men were interviewed and have been released under investigation.
