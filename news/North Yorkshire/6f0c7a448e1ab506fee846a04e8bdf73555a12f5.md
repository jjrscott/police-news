Commenting on the report, Assistant Chief Constable Ken McIntosh said:

"We welcome the recognition from HMIC that North Yorkshire Police has a sound grasp of the demand coming into the organisation and the way we are set up to respond to it. This is particularly the case when it comes to dealing with vulnerable people with the use of the 'THRIVE' model in the Force Control Room. This allows us to actively asses the threat, harm, risk, investigation, vulnerability and engagement required for each call for service, meaning we can tailor our response for each individual or situation and target resources more efficiently and effectively. This puts the needs of victims of crime at the very heart of everything we do and the high level of public satisfaction for our service reflects this effort.

"HMIC also highlights North Yorkshire Police's long track record in delivering essential savings whilst maintaining effective front-line policing services across North Yorkshire and the City of York. We are very proud to be the safest and lowest crime area in England and we will continue to work hard to maintain this position through careful financial and operational planning."
