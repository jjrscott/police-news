Police are appealing for a member of the public who intervened in an altercation in traffic in York to come forward.

Two suspects were arrested in connection with the incident last week, and police now need to locate the member of the public, as they may be able to assist the investigation.

At about 5pm on Monday 12 November, a man was driving his BMW car and turned right from the A1237 onto Boroughbridge Road, before coming to a stop due to traffic.

A man got out of a Renault car that stopped directly behind the BMW. This man opened the door of the BMW, and there was a brief verbal exchange, before he hit the BMW driver.

A physical altercation followed, at which point a member of the public intervened by trying to separate the two men. The female driver of the Renault car then got out of the car and spat at the BMW driver.

Following extensive enquiries, a man and a woman were arrested on Friday 7 December 2018 in connection with the incident. They have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

As part of the investigation, police need to speak to the member of the public who intervened, or indeed anyone who witnessed the incident. Please contact Police Investigator Katie Swift by dialling 101, selecting option 2 and stating collar number 6437, quoting incident reference 12180211921.
