A man has been arrested after police carried out a drugs warrant in Northallerton today.

Warrant: A police convoy approaches the address this morning.

Officers have warned that similar operations will follow as they tackle drug offending in the town.

Police executed a search warrant to enter a house on Bullamoor Close this morning.

A quantity of what police believe to be cannabis has already been recovered, along with drug paraphernalia. Further searches are currently continuing at the address today.

A Northallerton man in his 40s has been arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a class B drug.

He has been taken into custody while further searches and other enquiries continue.

Inspector Sarah Sanderson, of the Hambleton Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: “Today’s warrant is the first of many to come in the area.

“We’re working closely with the community and gathering intelligence that will enable us to target other addresses in the near future.

“I’d urge any resident who has concerns or suspicions about drug offending to share that with us by calling 101 and selecting option 1.

“You can also call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.”

Search: Police vehicles outside the house as a search takes place. Posted on 23 August 2019 at 11:28am in News stories
