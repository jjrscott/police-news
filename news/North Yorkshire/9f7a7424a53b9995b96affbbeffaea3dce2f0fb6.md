Police are appealing for information and witnesses after callous thieves stole Christmas decorations in Knaresborough.

Sometime between 8.30pm and 10.30pm on Thursday 26 November 2015, an illuminated festive display was taken from the lawn outside Knaresborough House on the town's High Street.

The two displays, showing Santa and a reindeer, are loaned each year to Knaresborough Town Council, and are a popular fixture in the town. The Santa display is about 4ft tall and has waving arms. The reindeer is slightly smaller. Both are acrylic and illuminated with fairy lights. Their theft has caused upset in the community.

The transformer used to power the lights was not taken, making the stolen displays difficult to switch on anyway.

__

Enquiries are ongoing to identify those responsible for the heartless theft, and return the display to its rightful location. Anyone who has any information that could assist the investigation is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police.

Please dial 101, select option 2 and ask for the Harrogate Investigation Hub; or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Please quote reference number 12150210526 when passing information.
