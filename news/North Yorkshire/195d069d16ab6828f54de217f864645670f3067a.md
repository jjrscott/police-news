North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information after a purse was stolen from a consulting room at a surgery in the Nidderdale area.

On Friday 3 August 2018 a member of staff at a GP surgery in Nidderdale discovered that a purse had been stolen from where it had been left in a temporarily unoccupied consulting room.

Witnesses at the surgery have described seeing a man and a woman standing around inside the surgery near to the consulting rooms between 9 and 10am on 3 August. At the time the surgery was busy. The couple have both been described as aged 40-50 years and wearing black or dark clothing. The man was wearing a lanyard with 'staff' written on it and is said to have looked like a security guard or maintenance man. The woman is said to have had her hair tied back in a ponytail.

The police are keen to identify both the man and the woman. If anyone saw them either in the surgery or outside, perhaps getting into a car please, call North Yorkshire Police on 101, choose option 1 and be ready to quote reference 276 of 3 August 2018. Alternatively, email: bill.hickson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
