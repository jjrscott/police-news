North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a '2 in 1' burglary that that occurred in Crosshills, near Skipton.

It happened at around 3.15am on Wednesday 15 July when three suspects tried to gain entry through the rear patio doors to a house on Burnroyd Avenue in Crosshills.

After a number unsuccessful attempts, and despite being disturbed by the victims who shouted at the suspects, the suspects broke the glass in the door to gain entry and took both sets of car keys to an Audi and a VW Polo parked outside.
