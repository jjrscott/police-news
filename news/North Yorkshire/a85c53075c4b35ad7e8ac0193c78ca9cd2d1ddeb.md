A woman in her 40s from Harrogate has been charged following an incident which began at Asda, Monks Cross, York yesterday (Wednesday, 10 May).

Officers were called to the area just after 3pm after reports of a shoplifting offence involving a trolley of groceries and meat.

A member of security staff attempted to stop a car believed to be involved in the incident but the vehicle left the scene in the direction of A1237.

A short time later an attempt was made to stop a vehicle on the A1237 near to the junction with the A19. A stinger device was deployed on the A59 before a car was stopped and a woman was arrested.

The woman has been charged with theft from a shop, driving without due care, failing to stop, driving without third party insurance and driving other than in accordance with a licence. She has been released on conditional bail to appear at York Magistrates Court on Thursday, 8 June.
