To coincide with President Donald Trumpâ€™s visit to the UK, a protest and march is due to take place in York city centre on Saturday 14 July 2018 between 12.30pm and 2.30pm.

North Yorkshire Police and City of York Council understand the concerns of local people and local businesses about what this could mean for them regarding disruption.

We have been working together, along with a wide range of local organisations, to plan for the demonstration and to minimise such disruption.

The police and council want to reassure and support all communities and businesses. Local people can have confidence in the police to maintain public safety and can be reassured that York will be returned to normal soon after the protest has ended.

We are very experienced in managing demonstrations and large-scale events in York. So please let us handle the situation with the resources at our disposal. There will be plenty of police officers working in the city centre to ensure public safety, including support from British Transport Police at York Train Station.

On the day of the demonstration, members of the public can view updates and accurate information from North Yorkshire Police and City of York Council on **Twitter**. You can follow **@NYorksPolice** and **@CityofYork**. We will be using the **#YorkDemo** hashtag.
