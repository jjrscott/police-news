North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about an assault that occurred in Harrogate during the early hours of 28 May 2017

A 26-year-old male was assaulted on Kings Road by a group of unknown males.

The incident started outside Bambinos takeaway whereby the victim was punched by one male causing him to fall backwards into the road. A few minutes later the same group were involved in an altercation outside Harrogate International Centre which resulted in another man in the group punching the victim to the head.

The incidents occurred during a short timescale of around 5 minutes at about 4.30am.

If members of the public were present and can offer any information or evidence which would lead to the identification of the suspects this would be beneficial to the case. The victim was dressed in light coloured shorts and a light coloured t-shirt at the time.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about the identities of the suspects involved.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for PC 437 Akram.
