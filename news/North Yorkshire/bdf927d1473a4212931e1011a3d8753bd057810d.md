North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about an assault that occurred outside a gym in Jennyfields, Harrogate.

It occurred at 9.30pm on Tuesday 7 August 2018 and involved group of young males who we believe to have been riding mini motor bikes on the field by the Hydro earlier in the day.

This group have assaulted a member of the public before fleeing on push bikes, a mini moto bike and a car.

We are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about who was in this group and who has been riding mini motor bikes in this area. We would also like to speak to the owner of a Ford KA which was seen in the area at the time.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Laura Jobling . You can also email laura.jobling@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk.

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
