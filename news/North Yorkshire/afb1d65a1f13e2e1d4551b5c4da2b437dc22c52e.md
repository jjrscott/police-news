Officers from North Yorkshire Police’s proactive county lines team, known as Operation Expedite, arrested two men on Wednesday afternoon and within 12 hours had charged one with drug offences and concealing criminal property.

The men, who are both from Leeds and aged 23 and 29, were arrested on the afternoon of Wednesday 29 January when officers stopped a vehicle in Harrogate. Inside they found a large quantity of drugs and cash.

By 2am the following morning, the passenger (29) was charged with possessing heroin and cocaine with intent to supply, and concealing criminal property.

The suspect appeared before York Magistrates Court on 30 January and was remanded into custody to appear at crown court at a later date.

The driver, who was arrested on suspicion of driving while unfit through drugs was released while under investigation.

Detective Sergeant Marcus Dawson who leads Operation Expedite, said: “These drugs have no place on our streets and North Yorkshire Police is committed to targeting those involved in this crime. We need your help to stop it. If you are concerned that a friend or loved one may be involved in county lines crime please call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously 0800 555 111.
