A man from York has been jailed for eight years for sexually abusing a boy.

Daniel Martin, aged 22, from the Clifton area of the city, was sentenced at York Crown Court – sitting at Leeds Crown Court – on Wednesday (10 June 2020).

He was also given a Sexual Harm Prevention Order for 10 years and placed on the sex offenders’ register for life.

Martin had previously pleaded guilty to two charges of rape, three counts of inciting a boy to commit a sexual act, and one count of sexual assault.

The offences occurred between 2013 and 2015 and began when the victim was 12 years of age.

The victim bravely came forward to North Yorkshire Police in June 2019 to report the non-recent sexual abuse.

Following a detailed investigation led by Detective Constable Rosanne Draycott, of York CID, Martin was finally brought to justice.

DC Draycott said: “The victim has endured unimaginable torment and trauma from a very young age, and the impact of the abuse continues to this day.

“The outcome at court will hopefully provide some comfort to him knowing that the perpetrator has been sent to prison for a very long time.

“This case proves again that it is never too late to seek justice against abusers, not matter when it occurred.

“We say to victims, please don’t suffer in silence - we are here to help and support you every step of the way.”
