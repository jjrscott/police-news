North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a criminal damage that occurred at Scarborough Library on Vernon Road.

It happened around 5:30pm on Wednesday 25 January 2017 when three men who were using the computer suite were asked to leave by staff for disturbing other members of the public.

On his way out of the building, one of the men pushed over a library stand, causing damage to the attached display cases. All three of them then left the library, turning right up Vernon Road towards Westborough.

The main suspect is described as being a white male, about 5'8″-5'9″ tall, of skinny build with short dark hair. At the time he was wearing a beanie hat with a bobble on top of it that had a navy coloured striped design, dark coloured tracksuit bottoms and a dark coloured long-sleeved jacket.

We are appealing for anybody who may have been near the library at the time and who may recognise the man to get in touch.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for PC Liam Cromack. You can also email direct liam.cromack@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk.

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12170018059.
