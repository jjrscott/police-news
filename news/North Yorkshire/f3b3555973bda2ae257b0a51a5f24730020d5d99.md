Officers in Selby are appealing to the public to help identify the man in the CCTV following theft of fuel from Tesco Express.

Officers want to speak to the man in connection with the incident, which happened at the garage on Doncaster Road, Brayton, Selby.

At around 9.15am on 26 November 2017, a man drove his silver BMW 1 Series into the forecourt and filled the car with over Â£50 worth of fuel. The man then drove away from Tesco Express without making any attempt to pay.

Anyone who recognises the man or who has any information is asked to contact police.

Dial 101, press 2 and ask to speak to PC Tim Mc Greevy.

Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Please quote crime reference number 12170214460 when passing on any information.
