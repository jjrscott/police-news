Police are appealing for witnesses and dash-cam footage after a man died in a collision in Scarborough.

Sadly, one of the occupants, a 19-year-old man from the Malton area, died at the scene of the collision.

Two other occupants of the car, a 17-year-old boy and an 18-year-old woman suffered slight injuries and have been arrested in connection with the collision. They remain in police custody at this time.

It is believe that the vehicle travelled from the town centre along Foreshore Road prior to the collision.

Police are appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time and either saw the grey Seat travelling through Scarborough, witnessed the collision or has any dash-cam footage of the car or the collision, to contact them if they have not already done so.

Anyone who can assist the investigation is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, and pass information for Traffic Sergeant Mark Patterson or email mark.patterson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

Please quote incident number 12200044473 when passing on information.

The road was closed to allow emergency services to attend to the casualties and to allow collision investigators to examine the scene. It reopened at around 8am on 15 March.
