The family of a teenager who died in a collision at the weekend have paid tribute to "the most beautiful, caring and fun-loving girl".

She has been identified as Autumn Hughes, 19, from Burton Salmon.

In a statement her family said today:

"Autumn was the most beautiful, caring and fun-loving girl, with a personality impossible to forget. She will be missed always and will remain forever in all of our hearts. We love you to the moon and back, Aut."

Police are continuing to appeal for anyone who witnessed or has dashcam footage of the collision, and anyone who saw either of the vehicles prior to the incident, to come forward. Officers have had a positive response to the appeal so far.

The collision happened just before 7.15pm on Saturday 6 October 2018. A grey Ford Fiesta, driven by Autumn, was travelling along Burton Common Lane from the Burton Common Farm end, in the direction of Burton Salmon. She was in company with a second Ford Fiesta, which was black with a white roof. The grey Ford Fiesta collided with a gate post close to the cricket club. Emergency services attended, but sadly the driver died at the scene.

Anyone with information should contact the Major Collision Investigation Team on 01609 643185 and speak to Detective Sergeant 1818 Jeremy Bartley or Traffic Constable 1469 Martin Recchia. You can also email MCIT@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk â€“ please quote reference 12180187078.
