North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a collision that occurred on the A1237 York ring road roundabout with Huntington and Strensall.

It happened at 4.30pm on Wednesday (27 May) and involved a tractor towing a trailer full of sheep.

As a result of the incident, the trailer overturned causing the sheep to escape on to the A1237. There are no reported injuries to the sheep or the driver of the tractor.

With the assistance of North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue, the road was partially closed for up to an hour to allow the sheep to be herded into a nearby field and to allow the tractor and trailer to be recovered.

Local diversions were put in place.

We are appealing for witnesses to the collision to get in touch as soon as possible to assist the investigation.

In particular, we are appealing for information about a small red hatchback vehicle which did not remain at the scene. It is believed the driver may hold essential information about the cause of the collision and Police are looking to trace the driver.

If you can help, please contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Mike Rowan. You can also email Michael.Rowan465@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
