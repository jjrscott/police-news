Police and other emergency services are inviting families to come and meet the people who keep them safe in York city centre this weekend.

North Yorkshire Police officers will be on Coney Street this Saturday afternoon with a marked police van for youngsters to explore. They’ll also be joined by firefighters from North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service, staff from Yorkshire Ambulance Service, and volunteers from York Rescue Boat – among others.

The emergency services have joined forces to give members of the local community the chance to get to know them, and discuss any issues they might have.

Inspector Andy Godfrey, from York City Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: “There will be emergency vehicles stationed along Coney Street on Saturday afternoon, and it’s a great opportunity for people to stop by and say hello. The city centre will be busy with events like the Great York Bunny Search and a Dinosaur World Live T-Rex model, so we’re hoping to meet lots of families as they pass by.

“Of course, due to the nature of what we do, we might get called away, but we’re hoping to be available from 12pm to 6pm. So if you’re in the city centre on Saturday, do stop by to see us, have a chat, and maybe even get a selfie. There’ll be plenty of emergency service vehicles and high-vis uniforms, so you won’t be able to miss us!”
