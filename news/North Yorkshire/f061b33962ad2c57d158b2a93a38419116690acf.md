At 7.54am on Friday 11 September 2015, police and paramedics were alerted by a member of the public to a body of an elderly man on the beach at North Bay in Scarborough.

The body was discovered adjacent to the sea defences situated off Albert Drive, between the toilets and the Oasis Caf√©.

Paramedics confirmed the death at the scene. Police are treating it as a sudden and unexplained death at this early stage as enquiries continue.

Officers are seeking the public's assistance to help identify the man who is described as white, aged between 75 and 85 and is 5ft 9in tall. He has a medium build with grey hair, blue-green eyes and size nine feet. He had a gold crown on the lower left side of his jaw.

The man was found wearing a white, purple and blue check full sleeve shirt, a white vest, grey socks and black 'Paddlers' make shoes. He was also wearing an analogue "Eton" watch.

Police would like to trace any witnesses who, during the past 24 hours, may have seen someone in the area of the North Bay or entering the water, who matches this description.

Anyone with information which could assist in this investigation should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 1, and speak to the Force Control Room. Please quote reference 12150160099.
