**Original release: Rolex thefts in York: Police issue CCTV images**

Police have released CCTV images of a man they want to speak to after three Rolex watches were snatched from a York jeweler's.

It happened yesterday at 11am at a shop in High Ousegate, in the city centre.

The suspect is described as a black man, around 5ft 10ins tall with long black dreadlocks. He wore a blue bandanna, a black bomber jacket with green, red and gold flowers on the back, black trousers and black shoes with white trim. He carried a designer over-the-shoulder bag.

Police believe the incident may be linked to a similar theft in Manchester.

Officers investigating the thefts have released CCTV images of a man they want to speak to in connection with the incident. They are also asking York shopkeepers to get in touch if they think the man may have visited their store.
