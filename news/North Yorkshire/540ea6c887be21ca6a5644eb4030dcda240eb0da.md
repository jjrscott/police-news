Police have issued efits of two suspects after a burglary in Whixley, York.

It happened between 2.45pm and 6.30pm on Tuesday 14 February 2017. Entry was gained to a property on Station Road, and electrical items and jewellery were stolen.

Despite extensive enquiries since then, those responsible have not yet been identified.

Based on witness descriptions, efits of the two men have been created.
