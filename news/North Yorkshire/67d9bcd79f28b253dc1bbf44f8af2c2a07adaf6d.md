A prolific York burglar has been jailed for three years.

David Wilson, 55, of Etty Avenue, was sentenced at York Crown Court on 22 February after pleading guilty earlier this month to two residential burglaries.

On 15 November 2019, Wilson broke into a home in Skelton near York where ransacked the property and stole a large amount of jewellery and electrical items.

He struck again on 24 November in Appleton Roebuck when he stole more jewellery and handbags.

At the time of being charged with the offences, Wilson was already serving a prison sentence for previous burglaries.

Police Staff Investigator, Dave Pegg, said: “Wilson has caused great distress to his victims and deserves every second of his sentence.

“Burglary is not just about material goods, it is a violation of your privacy and the sense of safety in your own home. It can have a long-lasting and profound effect on its victims.

“I hope this time, Wilson takes the opportunity to reflect on his crimes and the harm he has caused to his victims and takes every offer of help to leave his criminal past behind before being released."
