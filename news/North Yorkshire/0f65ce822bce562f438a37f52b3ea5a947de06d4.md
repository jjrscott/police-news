Police were called at around 2.45pm on Friday 19 June 2015, after reports that a lorry has spilled its load near Leyburn.

The lorry, which was carrying an agricultural chemical, lost some of its load on the A684 between Akebar Golf Club and Patrick Brompton.

The substance can cause an irritation to the skin and eyes.

The road is currently closed in both directions while the fire and rescue service deal with the spillage.

Motorists and members of the public are advised to avoid the area at this time.
