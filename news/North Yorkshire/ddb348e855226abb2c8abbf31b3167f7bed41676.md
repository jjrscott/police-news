Police investigating the theft of a purse in a Selby supermarket have released CCTV footage of two men they would like to speak to.

At around 11am on Saturday 16 September 2017, two men entered Aldi in Selby. One of the men approached a woman and distracted her by asking questions about an item he was going to buy, diverting her attention away from her trolley.

While doing this, a second man stole the victimâ€™s purse from her handbag, before leaving the store. The first man then left the store once the second man was out of sight.

Officers would like to speak to the two men pictured on CCTV as they may have important information that could assist the investigation.
