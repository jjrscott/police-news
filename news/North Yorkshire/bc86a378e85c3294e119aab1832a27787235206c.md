Last night the Government announced strict rules on what the public can and can't do to help restrict the spread of Coronavirus COVID-19.

Assistant Chief Constable Mike Walker is leading North Yorkshire Police's response to the outbreak.

He said: “The new and significant restrictions announced by the Prime Minister on Monday evening spell out very clearly what each and every one of us must do to save lives. The message is clear and the warning stark. Stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.

“These are the lives of the people we know and love. Our partners, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, children, grandparents. You may never be in such a position again where your simple actions will lead directly to saving lives.

“Alongside the new restrictions, the Government announced new powers to enforce them. I know the vast majority of people will follow the restrictions without question, as they have done so already and we will work with local communities to help reinforce the message should it be necessary.

"We sincerely hope that we will not have to resort to enforcement measures, but if we have to, we will. In the meantime, we are working with national police colleagues and the Government to obtain the details of the new legislation as it becomes available.

“Please continue to look after each other, try and make the most of the time spent with your loved ones, and remember we are here for you if you need us.”
