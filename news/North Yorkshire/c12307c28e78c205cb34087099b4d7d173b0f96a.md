North Yorkshire Police arrested three people near Tadcaster last week following a police pursuit that entered the county from West Yorkshire.

At around 2.17pm on Friday 26 May 2017, officers assisted colleagues from the neighbouring force following reports that an Audi A6 , reported as being stolen from Bradford, was travelling north along the A1 towards the North Yorkshire boundary.

Roads policing officers from North Yorkshire Police joined the pursuit as the vehicle came off the A1 and continued along the A64, through North Yorkshire, towards York.

Around ten minutes after the initial report, officers brought the car to a safe stop on the east-bound carriageway near Tadcaster and arrested the three occupants – two men and a woman from the Bradford area - and seized the stolen Audi.

The suspects were handed over to West Yorkshire Police who continue to investigate the incident. They have since been released on bail while enquiries continue.

Inspector Dave Barf of North Yorkshire Police’s Roads Policing Group, said: “This incident demonstrates the effectiveness of sharing information and working closely with colleagues from neighbouring forces. It sends a clear message that different police services will work as one to disrupt suspects and protect our communities.”
