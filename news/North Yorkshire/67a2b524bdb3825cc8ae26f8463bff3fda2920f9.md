North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a road traffic collision that occurred on the A65 between Coniston Cold and Hellifield.

At around 7.20am on Friday 10 July 2020, a silver Vauxhall Combo van was in collision with a silver Mitsubishi ASX travelling in opposing direction.

In particular, we are appealing for information about the driving of both vehicles leading up to the incident. We are particularly interested to hear from a heavy goods vehicle that may have been overtaken prior to the collision and anybody with dashcam footage of the incident.
