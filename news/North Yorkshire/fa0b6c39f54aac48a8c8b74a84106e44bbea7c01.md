North Yorkshire Police is good at reducing crime, keeping people safe, operating efficiently and providing sustainable services to the public according to the latest Government report.

However, the report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services, also found areas where improvements should be made.

The publication of the report on 27 September 2019, follows an inspection in April 2019 that looked at the force’s effectiveness, efficiency and legitimacy, known as the Integrated PEEL Assessment.

Commenting on the report, Chief Constable Lisa Winward said: “People are at the heart of policing and keeping them safe is ultimately what we are here to do, so I welcome the report which recognises that we are good at this, good at preventing and investigating crime, and in particular, that we are good at identifying and protecting vulnerable people.

“I am very pleased that it has singled out particular areas of work for praise such as our scheme to help people with learning difficulties and that it acknowledges some of the key areas of vulnerability where we work well such as the management of sex offenders and supporting vulnerable victims.

“We acknowledge that there are areas where improvements should be made and plans are already in place to address these. For example, the introduction of stop and search boards designed to provide scrutiny for this intrusive area of policing and investment in software, resources and training to identify potential corruption within the force.

“I am pleased with the report overall and thank everyone including our staff and volunteers for their continuous hard work, our partners whose role is vital in helping us protect people, and members of the public for their support.”
