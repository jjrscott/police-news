Just after 11am on Friday 15 June 2018, PCSO Barrie Dolan, who has worked in the town for the last 16 years, was patrolling in the area when he was alerted to a man lying on the floor having suffered a medical episode.

A 70 year-old man was unresponsive, and as his condition deteriorated quickly, PCSO Barrie Dolan and the shopping centre’s cleaner, Ben Lacey, began CPR and requested urgent assistance from colleagues and the ambulance service.

PC Danielle Vidler, who has recently completed her tutorship, and PC Kirsty Forth, who has recently transferred to the force from Bedfordshire Police arrived at the scene shortly after where they took turns to deliver CPR while waiting for paramedics to arrive.

Meanwhile, Sergeant Will Knapp and other officers rushed to the scene from the police station with a defibrillator and worked together to secure an effective airway and save the man’s life.

When paramedics from the Yorkshire Ambulance Service arrived they continued chest compressions and rushed the man to Scarborough District Hospital, where he is expected to make a full recovery.

Commenting on the incident, Superintendent Alisdair Dey, Neighbourhood Policing Commander for Scarborough and Ryedale said:

“Without the actions of our officers the outcome could have been very different.

“The paramedics who arrived at the scene stated that due to Barrie’s early actions, a life had been saved."

“We are very proud of them and they are a credit to North Yorkshire Police.”
