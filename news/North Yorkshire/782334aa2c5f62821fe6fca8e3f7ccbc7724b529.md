As fog descends across North Yorkshire, police road safety experts have released illuminating images, showing the importance of using headlights.

Two photographs were taken on the county's roads this morning - one showing an oncoming car with its headlights off, and another with its headlights on.

The second vehicle is far easier to see from a distance.

Police today emphasised the safety reasons for using headlights when visibility is reduced.

A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: "You must use headlights when visibility is seriously reduced, generally when you cannot see for more than 100 metres.

"When driving in fog, you should use your lights as required, and beware of other drivers not using them. Remember that lights don't just light up the road - they also help others see you in poor weather.

"You should always keep a safe distance behind the vehicle in front, and be able to pull up well within the distance you can see clearly."

The two images were captured from one of North Yorkshire Police's safety camera vans. Part of the force's Traffic Bureau, the vans aim to make the county's roads safer by enforcing speed limits, as well as dealing with offences such as using a mobile phone whilst driving, driving whilst not wearing a seatbelt and driving whilst not in proper control.
