Officers attended a flat on Lucas Avenue, York, at 4.15pm on Tuesday 6 October 2020, as part of routine enquiries into an offence of criminal damage to a pub window.

When they arrived, a 35-year-old man inside the flat threatened officers, brandished a hammer, and smashed a window.

Specially-trained firearms officers were deployed to the scene to keep everyone safe, while a police negotiator spoke to the man.

At 11pm, the man left the property and was arrested. He has been charged with a public order offence and obstructing police yesterday, and criminal damage to the window of a pub in Clifton, York, last month. He is due to appear at York Magistrates Court in January 2021.

No one was injured, and the situation was brought to a safe conclusion. We know this must have been a concerning incident for residents living nearby, and we are grateful for their patience and understanding.
