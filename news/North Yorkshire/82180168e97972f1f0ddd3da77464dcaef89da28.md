Police are appealing for witnesses to a serious three-vehicle collision on the A658 at Follifoot, at the junction with Haggs Road, in the Harrogate area.

It occurred at 3.11pm on Sunday (2 December 2018) and involved a white Mercedes-Benz C220, a grey Mini with a red roof and a silver Porsche.

The driver of the Mini, a 22-year-old man from Newcastle, is in a serious but stable condition at Leeds General Infirmary.

Local diversions were put in place while the emergency services worked at the scene and to allow a full police examination. Highways also had to clear debris from the surface.

The road re-opened just after 9pm.

Witnesses to the collision or anyone who recalls any of the vehicles involved prior to the incident, are urged to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Pete Stringer. Or email Peter.Stringer@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk. Please quote reference 12180224633.
