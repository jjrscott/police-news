Police were contacted by a member of the public at 6.55am this morning (Tuesday 8 August 2017) to reports of a property on Scalby Road having been broken into and a van being taken from the driveway.

UPDATED

A 33-year-old man has been charged with the following offences and is due to appear at York Magistrates' Court on 9 August 2017.

 * Burglary
 * Dangerous driving
 * Theft of a vehicle
 * Making off without payment
 * Driving without insurance
 * Licence offence

***************************************************************************************************

Access to the property had been gained by a side door and the keys to the vehicle had been taken. The van was then driven away from the driveway of the property.

A detailed description of the van was taken and officers began to search in the local area.

Minutes later, a petrol station on Boak End in Scarborough reported a van filling up with Â£30 worth of petrol and making off in the direction of Scarborough, without offering any payment.

The description of the van taken matched the description of the van stolen from Scalby Road.

Officers started to search in the area and quickly located the van in the area of North Lane, Cayton. Officers then attempted to stop the van, however the driver made off.

Police successfully stopped the vehicle in the Dunslow Road area and a 33-year-old man from Filey was arrested in connection with the investigation. He currently remains in police custody.

Anyone who witnessed anything which would assist the investigation is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 1 and ask to speak to the Force Control Room. Please quote reference 12170139865.
