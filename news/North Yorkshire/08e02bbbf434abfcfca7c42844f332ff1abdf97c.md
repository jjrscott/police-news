Scarborough police are appealing for witnesses and information following the theft of a mobility scooter in Scarborough.

It happened at a property to the rear of Queen Street at approximately 5.30pm on Thursday 8 June 2017 when thieves stole a black, Road King Class 3 mobility scooter. The engine number is 18976C74A0068.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to identify the thieves and bring those responsible to justice.

PC Matthew Rogers of Scarborough police said: "Why anyone would deprive a disabled person of their means of transport is beyond comprehension. Someone, somewhere must have seen the scooter being wheeled away or know where it is now. I urge anyone who has any information that could help us find the scooter or those responsible for stealing it to contact us. If you don't want to speak to the police, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously. Please do the right thing and tell us what you know."

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101 and ask for the Safer Neighbourhood Service Desk.

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12170099939.
