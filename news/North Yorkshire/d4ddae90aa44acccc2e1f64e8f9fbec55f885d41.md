Nine new police officers were welcomed to North Yorkshire Police last week.

The new recruits were awarded their Certificate of Knowledge in Policing by Supt Mike Walker at a passing out ceremony held at police headquarters on Friday 22 July 2016.

The new officers have successfully completed an intensive 19-week initial training course which covers law, personal safety, search techniques, public order, first aid and a local community placement, all designed to prepare them for life on the beat.

The officers also undertook a considerable amount of home study as part the course to gain their qualification and prepare them for their career in policing.

Speaking about the new recruits Superintendent Mike Walker said “I’m delighted to welcome the new officers to North Yorkshire Police. They have all worked very hard to complete their initial training and achieve their qualification. I wish them well in the career and am sure they each of them will be an asset to the communities they will serve.”

Julia Mulligan, Police and Crime Commissioner for North Yorkshire, said “My congratulations go out to the new recruits. I know they’ve put a considerable amount of hard work and effort in to get to this point. They can now look forward to going out into the community and putting that training into practice.”

“The addition of the new recruits moves us closer to achieving our aim of increasing the number of officers in North Yorkshire. This means we are in a stronger position to deliver our goals set out in the Police and Crime Plan – protecting vulnerable people; cutting crime and anti-social behaviour and providing a better service to victims of crime.”

The new officers have a variety of backgrounds with some being graduates in subjects such as Criminology and Psychology and some having worked in roles ranging from the prison service to sales and customer services. Many have worked for the police service as Community Support Officers, Police Staff or Special Constables.

The new officers are:
