A Land Rover Discovery has now been crushed after Mark James Hughes, 33, of Eden Street, Horden, Durham, was found guilty of criminal damage. He was ordered to pay £1,000 compensation and have his vehicle taken off him at Northallerton Magistrates Court on 25 August 2017.

On 12 November 2016, the Land Rover Discovery was driven on to a field at Topcliffe. It got stuck and buried into the mud to axle depth. Hughes was seen nearby, and subsequently interviewed by officers.

The field was due to be replanted in the near future, but because the vehicle had driven over it, it could no longer be planted, due to the risk of contaminants.

At court, Hughes was also disqualified from driving for six months.

PC Arfan Rahouf, of North Yorkshire Police’s Rural Taskforce, said:

“Hughes’ thoughtless and reckless actions caused substantial inconvenience and financial loss to a farm business.

I hope that the crushing of the vehicle, along with the compensation and driving ban sends a very clear message that this behaviour is absolutely unacceptable to North Yorkshire’s rural communities, and police will deal with such incidents robustly.”
