Police are appealing for information after a mindless vandal damaged and stole a large plant from a display in Whitby.

At 1.10am on Saturday 6 May 2017, a man wearing a white shirt pulled a leylandii spiral plant, valued at around Â£200, out of a pot at the end of Baxtergate. He then proceeded to drag the plant around the town centre.

The three-foot tall plant had been growing in the council-owned pot for five years before it was uprooted and stolen.

Officers are investigating, and have issued a CCTV still of a man they would like to speak to in connection with the theft.

Anyone with any information about who is responsible for the theft, or who recognises the man pictured in the CCTV image, is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police. Call 101, select option 2 and ask for PC David Laverick or Whitby Police, quoting reference 12170080297.
