Imagine winning a visit to your primary school from a real-life Police Tractor!

We're running a competition for primary school children in North Yorkshire and the City of York.

Five lucky winners will get the chance for Bobby, our Police Tractor, to visit their school (subject to their agreement, of course).

First of all, you need to tell us **how many sheep can you count in this picture?**

Second, tell us **if Bobby wasn 't a Police Tractor, what would he be, and why?**

All correct entries will be identified, and the the best answers to the tiebreaker question will be selected by Inspector Jon Grainge from our Rural Taskforce.

## Enter now!

When you’re ready to submit your entry, you’ll need to email us your details.

Please include in your email:

 * Parent’s name
 * Parent’s phone number
 * Child’s name
 * Child’s age
 * Child’s primary school
 * Your guess at the number of sheep in the picture
 * Your answer to the tiebreaker question

Send it all to **digital@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk**

We must receive your entry by 5pm on **Monday 23 April 2018**.

Good luck!

## Meet Bobby

Look our for Bobby the Police Tractor (and our Rural Taskforce officers) at shows and events around North Yorkshire this summer.
