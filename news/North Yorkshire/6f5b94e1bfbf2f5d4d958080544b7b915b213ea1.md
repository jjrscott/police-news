“We are liaising closely with the travelling community based at Whitley Bridge Cricket Club who have reassured us that they will be leaving the site by tomorrow at the latest.

“It’s not possible to be more specific about a time at this stage.

“We continue to thank the local community for their understanding as we work together to address their concerns and bring the situation to a conclusion.
