Police are appealing for witnesses to a serious collision on the A19 to contact them.

Police were contacted at 12.30pm Tuesday 10 July 2018 to reports of a serious collision on the southbound side of the A19 at Trenholme Bar, near to the turn off for Hutton Rudby.

Three vehicles had been involved in the collision – a Ford Luton transit van which had come to rest partially into the hard shoulder and lane 1, a Scania HGV wagon travelling in lane 1 and a Volvo S40 which was in lane 2.

All emergency services attended the scene. A 31-year-old woman passenger from the Volvo was taken to James Cook Hospital by air ambulance, where she remains in a critical condition.

The 54-year-old woman driver of the Volvo sustained serious injuries and was also transported to James Cook Hospital. She too remains in hospital in a stable condition.

Both drivers from the Luton van and the HGV are helping police with their enquiries.

The road was closed between East Rounton and Crathorne, to allow the Collision Investigation Unit to attend and carry out a full investigation of the scene and for the carriageway to be cleared. The road was reopened at 6.55pm

Officers are appealing for any witnesses who saw the collision or either vehicle prior to it, or anyone who may have captured dash cam footage of the incident to contact them.

Please dial 101, select option 2 and ask to speak to Sgt Hamish Halloway. You can also email __Hamish.Halloway@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk – please quote reference 12180124696.
