Police have issued CCTV images of two men they would like to speak to in connection with the theft of historic jewellery from a shop in York.

At about 9.55am on Saturday 22 April 2017, two men entered The Red House Antique Centre in Duncombe Place.

They forced open one of the cabinets and stole a number of valuable Roman gold and silver jewellery items. The items, by their nature, are distinctive and unique.

Officers would like to speak to the two men pictured on CCTV as they may have important information that could assist the investigation.

Police have also released photographs of some of the stolen items, and are urging businesses and members of the public to be vigilant and report it if they are offered for sale.

Anyone with information about the theft is asked to phone North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for PC Rachel Shaw, or email rachel.shaw@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
