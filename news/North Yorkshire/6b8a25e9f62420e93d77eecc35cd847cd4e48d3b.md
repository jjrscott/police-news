Officers, PCSOs and staff at Eastfield Police Station have clubbed together to collect Easter Eggs, selection boxes, sweets and boxes of biscuits and for children in the community.

Organisers PC J-S Coleman and PCSO Sarah Colbourne, of Eastfield Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "A lot of people are still seeing this as a time of hardship, deprivation and poverty whilst struggling to make ends.

"This year we also have those extra people who have been laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic, not forgetting the children in the community we work in. For this reason, we saw this as a perfect opportunity for us to reach out to the community by supporting local charity the Westway Open Arms.‚Äù

The Reverend Sam Taylor, Director of the Westway Open Arms, said: "We would like to express our heartfelt thanks to everybody at Eastfield Police Station. This will certainly help our vulnerable people and their families this Easter.

"The local police's support is very much appreciated and helps us to continue to support our local community of Eastfield and surrounding areas in this time of need."
