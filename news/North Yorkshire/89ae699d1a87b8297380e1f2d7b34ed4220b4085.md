North Yorkshire Police are appealing for witnesses and information following an assault on a 13-year-old boy on the number 1 bus travelling from York city centre in the direction of Acomb on Monday 3 April 2017.

At around 4pm the boy was sitting at the front of the bus on the top deck. The bus had just left the Blossom Street bus stop when a man described as white, aged in his 50’s of large build with a bald head and grey hair to the sides, wearing a grey round neck jumper and carrying a white carrier bag sat next to the boy. The man is believed to have assaulted the boy by grabbing his face and elbowing him in the chin, causing the boy to fall backwards. The man then left the bus at the Front Street bus stop in Acomb.

The 13-year-old victim did not suffer any serious injuries, but has been left shaken by the incident.

Police are conducting enquiries and are requesting the public’s assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

We are appealing for information from anyone who witnessed the incident and in particular from a man who it is believed challenged the suspect following the incident.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for PC 1742 Pauline Law. You can also email pauline.law@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12170056449.
