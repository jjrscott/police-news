Police are appealing for witnesses after a Harley Davidson was stolen from Catterick Garrison.

At sometime between 10.30am and 9pm on Friday 8 May 2015, thieves broke into a residential garage on Derby Way, and took a purple 1800cc Harley Davidson FLHXSE CVO Street Glide.

The limited edition Harley is valued at Â£16,000 and has a distinctive scratch on the paintwork on the offside pannier.

The bike was advertised for sale on eBay at the time it was stolen.

Officers believe that the Harley was taken away on a trailer or in the back of a large van and are appealing to anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area around the time of the theft to get in touch.

Anyone who can help officers with their enquiries is urged to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101 - select option 2 - and ask for PC Jim Egan or Catterick Garrison police.

Alternatively, information can be emailed tojames.egan@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you prefer not to give your name, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Please quote reference number 12150076241 when passing information about this incident.
