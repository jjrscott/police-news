On Wednesday 13 September 2017, North Yorkshire Police were made aware of a silver Audi TT, stolen in July from a property in Barton-on-Humber in Humberside, which was believed to be travelling in the area on false number plates.

Through the use of ANPR cameras (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) the car's movements were traced and it was sighted on the eastbound carriageway of the M62 near junction 32.

As police located the vehicle the driver made off, driving along the hard should of the motorway between junction 33 and 34. The vehicle then exited the motorway at junction 34 and headed toward the A19 at Whitley.

Following a short pursuit, officers successfully brought the vehicle to a stop. When stopped, the driver and passenger ran from the vehicle. Officers followed on foot and the driver was located in a nearby field and arrested. The passenger was not located and remains outstanding.

A 15-year-old boy from Morley, West Yorkshire was arrested on suspicion of failing to stop, dangerous driving, driving without a licence, driving without insurance, burglary with intent to steal, handling stolen goods and aggravated vehicle taking. He currently remains in police custody.
