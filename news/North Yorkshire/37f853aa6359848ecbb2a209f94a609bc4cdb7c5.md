Residents in rural areas of North Yorkshire are being urged to remain vigilant for stone thieves, after a part of a wall was taken from near Leyburn.

Some time between 9 July and 11 July, three metres of walling stone was taken from a wall at the top of Bellerby Bank. Those responsible would have needed a van or a pick-up to remove the stone. Other parts of the wall were damaged in the process.

Similar incidents have also been reported in the area. Anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious is asked to phone North Yorkshire Police on 101, quoting reference NYP-11072017-0264.

If you have been offered stone recently in suspicious circumstances, or are having building work done that needed stone, please consider where it may have come from.

North Yorkshire Policeâ€™s Rural Taskforce is supporting a Heritage Watch campaign, urging local communities to be on the look-out for theft and criminal damage that destroys the county's cultural heritage.
