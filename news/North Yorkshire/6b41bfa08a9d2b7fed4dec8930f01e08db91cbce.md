A 19-year-old Harrogate man appeared in court on Saturday morning less than 24 hours after his arrest on suspicion of possessing crack cocaine with intent to supply.

The man was arrested by North Yorkshire Police’s proactive Operation Expedite team on Cheltenham Mount in Harrogate on Friday morning (2 October). The arrest followed a short foot chase after officers suspected drug dealing was taking place. A quantity of suspected crack cocaine was also seized by officers.

The man was later charged with possessing Class A drugs with intent to supply and was remanded in custody. He appeared at York Magistrates’ Court on Saturday morning (sitting at Leeds) where the case was sent for trial on 9 November 2020.
