Police are appealing for witnesses after a man died in a collision on Hauxwell Lane, Scotton, near Catterick Garrison.

The collision occurred at about 1.45pm on Monday 17 August 2015, and involved a yellow-coloured rigid HGV and a green-coloured Ford Focus estate car.

The driver of the car sustained fatal injuries and was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

Police are appealing for any witnesses to the collision or anyone who saw either vehicle prior to the collision to come forward.

In particular, officers are keen to speak to a couple in a red-coloured vehicle who stopped a PCSO near to the collision to inform them of the collision, and also a pedal cyclist who stopped at the scene.

Anyone with information is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police - dial 101, select option 2 and ask for the Major Collision Investigation Team. Alternatively, information can be emailed tomcit@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk.

Please quote reference number 12150143801 when passing information.
