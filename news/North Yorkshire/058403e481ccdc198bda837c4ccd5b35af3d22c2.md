North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about two arson attacks that occurred in Selby .

A black Honda 125 cc moped was taken from Cockret Road and moved to Barker Drive where it was set alight and damaged beyond repair. It happened in the early hours of Thursday 23 November 2017, from around 4am.

A further incident occurred nearby, in Buller Street, where a wheelie bin was set on fire. This occurred at around the same time as the incident in Barker Drive and the two incidents are believed to be connected.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about anyone seen behaving suspiciously in and around Buller Street and Barker Drive in the early hours of Thursday morning or anyone posting information about, or discussing, their involvement in this incident on social media or elsewhere.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for Justine Gallie. You can also email justine.gallie@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk.
