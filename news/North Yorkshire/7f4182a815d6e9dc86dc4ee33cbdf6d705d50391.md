Officers have thanked the public and media who shared their appeal on Wednesday to help them identify two people on CCTV.

The appeal received an 'excellent response' and officers now have the information they need.

**Original release: CCTV appeal after 95 year-old 's bank card is fraudulently used in Scarborough**

North Yorkshire Police is appealing for help to identify two people in relation to the fraudulent use of a bank card.

It happened on Wednesday 20 November after a 95-year-old man lost his wallet in Scarborough Town Centre. Later the same day, a bank card which had been inside the wallet was used in an attempt to pay for goods at a local supermarket.

Officers in Scarborough are asking for the public’s assistance to identify the male and female featured in the images as they may have information that could help the investigation.

Investigating officer PC Liam Cromack explained: “I am appealing for anyone who recognises the male and female in the images to get in touch. I am also keen to hear from anyone who may have found a discarded wallet or bank card in the town centre recently.

Although only a relatively small amount of money was lost, this incident has still had a profound effect on the elderly victim. Any information could be extremely useful in identifying other lines of enquiry.”

Anyone with information is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for Liam Cromack. You can also email liam.cromack@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk.

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12190213785.
