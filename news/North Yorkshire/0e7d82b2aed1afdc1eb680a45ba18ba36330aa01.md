An investigation into the alleged attempted kidnap of three girls in Knaresborough on Monday 11 March 2019 has now concluded and no further action is to be taken against the two men arrested in connection with the incident.

Following their enquiries, detectives found that the men had been in the area and stopped their van for a legitimate reason and had not caused any distress or harm to the girls.

Detective Sergeant Paul Schofield said:

“We have now concluded our enquiries and we are satisfied that the two men involved did not cause the girls any harm and had stopped in the area for genuine reasons, so no further action will be taken against them.

“While this incident seems to be one of miscommunication, the girls took the right steps to leave a situation in which they felt uncomfortable and raise their concerns with an appropriate adult who then contacted the police.”
