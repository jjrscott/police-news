Ripon residents are invited to join a webchat giving them the chance to ask questions about policing, crime and anti-social behaviour in the city.

Sergeant Andrew Tiffany of Ripon’s Neighbourhood Policing Team will host the webchat between 6pm and 7pm on Wednesday 24 May 2017.

They will be online to discuss peoples’ experiences with Ripon police and to talk about how the policing service in the city can be further improved.

Sergeant Tiffany said: “Webchats are an excellent way of engaging and communicating with our residents, allowing us to address the issues that concern local communities the most, and we will do our best to answer any questions that come our way.

“For those who can’t attend the online event, you can ask questions in advance via social media, and of course there are plenty of opportunities to meet your local police face-to-face as well.”

To join the webchat visit www.northyorkshire.police.uk/webchat between 6pm and 7pm on Wednesday 24 May 2017.
