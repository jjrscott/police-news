Police are appealing for witnesses to a serious assault in Strensall to contact them, after an 18-year-old local man has been left with a broken jaw.

At 9pm on Friday 10 November 2017, the victim was waiting for the number 5 bus from the bus stop near the Londis petrol station on Strensall Road in Strensall.

He was then approached by three men from a group of nine and was punched in the face and hit over the head with a glass bottle. The attack left the man with a broken jaw, which has since required surgery and deep lacerations to his mouth.

Police want to speak to anyone who has any information which could assist the investigation, or anyone who was in the area of Strensall Road at the time of the attack, who may have witnessed anything.

Please contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask to speak to the York Serious Crime Team.

Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.
