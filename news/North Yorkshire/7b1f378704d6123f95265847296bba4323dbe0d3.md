Police are appealing for information after trees in Naburn were damaged.

A number of trees in a small woodland area off Moor Lane, Naburn, have been daubed with graffiti.

Officers are keen to hear from anyone who can identify those responsible for this mindless vandalism.

Please dial 101, select option 2 and ask for PCSO Richard Bolland, or email richard.bolland@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk if you can assist the investigation.
