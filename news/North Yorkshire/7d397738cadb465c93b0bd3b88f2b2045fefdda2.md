Victim died in hospital following assault in Golden Last pub, Scarborough

James Arthur Collinson

James Arthur Collinson, 38 of Bridlington has been jailed for six years with an extended period of four years on probation following the death of 59-year-old John Glenn from Scarborough.

Collinson was jailed at Leeds Crown Court on 14 February after pleading guilty of the manslaughter of Mr Glenn.

The incident happened at the Golden Last pub on Eastborough, Scarborough on 1 September 2019, just after 6pm. An altercation occurred in the pub and Collinson punched Mr Glenn before punching him again as he was leaving the pub, a blow which knocked him unconscious.

Ambulance crews attempted to resuscitate Mr Glenn before he was taken to Scarborough District Hospital and placed into a medically induced coma. Mr Glenn did not respond to treatment and sadly passed away on 27 September 2019.

Collinson was remanded in custody and appeared via video link from HMP Hull at Leeds Crown Court, where he was sentenced.

Investigating Officer, North Yorkshire Police’s Detective Inspector Jonathan Sygrove, said:

“Collinson has a long history of violence and assault and his sentence clearly reflects the seriousness of his most recent offence which resulted in the tragic loss of a man’s life. His actions have caused a huge amount of pain for John Glenn’s family and this is something they will have to deal with for the rest of their lives.”

Mr Glenn’s family ask that their privacy is respected.
