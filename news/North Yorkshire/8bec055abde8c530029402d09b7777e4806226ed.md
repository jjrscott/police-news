North Yorkshire Police have successfully obtained a forfeiture order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA) against a woman from York, for cash amounting to £2990 that was seized during a drugs warrant.

Yazmin Biggs, 61, has also been told she must pay £895 in costs to North Yorkshire Police's Legal Services Department.

Police seized the cash during a search of the home address of Ms Biggs, following reports of drug related activity at the property.

When she appeared in court, Ms Biggs claimed that nothing illegal had taken place in relation to the cash. However when hearing the circumstances in which the cash was seized and details of the subsequent financial investigation, the Magistrates decided that it was more likely than not that the cash was derived from criminal activity.

T/Detective Inspector Rowland of the Force Economic Crime Unit said:

"This particular case once again demonstrates that even when the result of a criminal investigation no further action (NFA), if the cash is seized in suspicious circumstances the Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) allows North Yorkshire Police to continue to investigate the origin and intended use of that cash.

"Officers from the force's Economic Crime Unit will work hard to put evidence before a court and they will decide if the cash was derived from criminal activity or was intended for use in such activity.

"The outcome with Ms Biggs reinforces the message to those wishing to engage in criminal activity, that the Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) will be used at every opportunity."
