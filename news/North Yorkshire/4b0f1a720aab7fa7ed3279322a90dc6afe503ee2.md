North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a dog bite that occurred in Cayton.

It happened at a play park in Cayton Village Caravan Park on 13th August 2016 and involved a dog biting a child, leaving puncture wounds and bruising on his leg. The victim attended Scarborough General Hospital and was refered to his GP.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the public’s assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about two dogs that were off-lead in the area that evening. A lurcher type dog and a black sheep dog (possibly a Collie). The persons accompanying the dogs were described as follows:

White male, tall, with long hair down to his shoulders and of a chubby build,

White female, late 40’s, blonde hair, and tall but shorter than the male involved.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for Adam Varney. You can also email adam.varney@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
