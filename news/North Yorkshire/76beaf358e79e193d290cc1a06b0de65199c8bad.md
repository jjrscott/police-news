Saturday 4 July was busy for North Yorkshire Police but there were no major issues or concerns.

There were small pockets of rowdy and antisocial behaviour but no significant or large incidents due to the opening of licensed venues.

Our licensing team carried out a number of visits to licensed premises during the day and were pleased to report that all venues visited had worked hard to make their premises safe for customers.

Assistant Chief Constable Mike Walker, said: “My thanks to everyone who enjoyed last night responsibly and to the licensees who have worked hard over the past weeks to prepare for opening. It’s inevitable that with alcohol consumption comes antisocial behaviour and we were prepared for an increase in demand. It was busy but no more than a usual Saturday night.”
