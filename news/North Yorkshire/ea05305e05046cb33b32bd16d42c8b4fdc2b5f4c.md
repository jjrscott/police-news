Police investigating a shop theft in Skipton have released CCTV footage of a man to whom they would like to speak.

At about midday on Wednesday 8 March 2017, a man entered Van Dyke Vapes on Water Street, Skipton, and engaged a member of staff in conversation. He distracted the staff member and stole a mobile phone from the top of the counter. He then left the store and made off in the direction of Skipton town centre.

Police would like to speak to the man pictured on CCTV in the shop, as he may have important information that could assist the investigation.
