Did you know planting and garden design can help improve the security of your home?

#### **By designing and maintaining your garden with the following tips from the Secured by Design initiative, you 'll be reducing your chances of becoming a victim of crime.**

 * #### Rear fences should be two metres high, including a trellis to support plants but not to support the weight of a possible intruder.

 * #### Keep fences and plants in the front garden below one metre in height so you don't give potential burglars somewhere to hide.

 * #### Reinforce the gardenâ€™s perimeter by planting prickly shrubs or a thorny hedge and train them to grow on trellis on top of 1.8 metre fencing to deter potential offenders.

 * #### Side gates should be solid, flat faced and the same height as the fence. Secure with padbolts top and bottom, padlocks and a spring return.

 * #### Maintenance of fences and gates is important, make sure they don't fall into disrepair and give easy access to your property.

 * #### Lay gravel on paths and beneath doors and ground-floor windows - burglars don't like it because it's noisy to walk on.

 * #### Lighting can deter or draw attention to thieves. Use energy saving bulbs activated by a dawn to dusk sensor.

 * #### Secure plant pots to the ground using a bolt and retaining anchor plate and mark tools and furniture with your postcode followed by your house number.

 * #### Sheds typically contain tools, bikes and gardening equipment which are not just valuable but which could prove useful to a burglar, so secure the door with padbolts and close-shackle padlocks or a padlock alarm. Hinges should be fitted using coach bolts and large backing washers. You could also think about installing a shed alarm and a lockable chest for chemicals and valuable equipment.

 * #### Secure an oil tank with padlocks, oil level gauge, security lighting and defensive planting. Speak to your local Crime Reduction officer for information on suitable alarms.

 * #### If finances allow, install motion sensitive CCTV.
