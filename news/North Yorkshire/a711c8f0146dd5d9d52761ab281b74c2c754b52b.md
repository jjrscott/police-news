We are wanting anyone who was on the B6265 travelling in either direction, from 4pm onwards yesterday, to get in touch following a fatal collision near Boroughbridge

The incident occurred on the B6265 at Great Ouseburn just before 6pm yesterday evening (Thursday 5 February 2015) and involved a yellow Fiat Panda and a red tractor.

The vehicles collided head on and the driver of the Fiat Panda, a man from Boroughbridge in his 70s, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. The woman passenger in the Fiat Panda, also in her 70s and from Boroughbridge, was taken to hospital for a check up.

The driver of the tractor, a 33 year old man from the Leeds area, was uninjured and arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He has been released on bail while the investigation into the incident continues.

Police are appealing for anyone who saw either the vehicles prior to the crash, or who witnessed the incident to contact them. Please call 101, press option 2 and ask to speak to the Major Collision Investigation Team or email MCIT@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
