At 10.15am on 3 August 2017, a member of the public called North Yorkshire Police to make a report of suspicious behaviour.

A man delivering charity bags in the Holyrood Drive area of York was reportedly seen to be acting suspiciously and trying doors as he was delivering the bags through letterboxes.

Officers attended the area and arrested a 17 year old from Bradford on suspicion of theft and burglary. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

A police spokesperson said:

“Reports from members of the public like this are so important. The public are the eyes and ears within communities and we want anyone who sees anything suspicious or unusual to contact us.

“Often people see things but don’t report it as they think it’s nothing. We want to encourage people to come forward with information because it can lead to investigations to combat threats of harm in our communities”.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police. Dial 101, press 1 and speak to the force control room.

Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted on 0800 555 111.

Please quote crime reference number 12170136769 when passing on any information.
