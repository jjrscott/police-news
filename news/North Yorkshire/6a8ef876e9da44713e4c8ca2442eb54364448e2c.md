North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information after a York cyclist was injured a driver that failed to stop at the scene of the collision

It happened on Tang Hall Lane with the junction of Fifth Avenue around 11.20pm on Wednesday 18 October 2017 and involved a vehicle pulling out of Fifth Avenue onto Tang Hall Lane that collided with a cycle that was travelling down Tang Hall Lane from Hull Road.

The vehicle did not stop and the cyclist was left on the road in the junction of Fifth Avenue where he was found by members of the public passing by, who phoned for an Ambulance. The cyclist was taken to York Hospital for treatment and treated for a possible fractured collarbone, abrasions and bruises.

It is alleged that the cyclist went onto the bonnet of the vehicle, which may have caused damage to the front of the vehicle involved.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about the vehicle that did not stop, unfortunately at this time we have no vehicle type, make or model. But we urge people to look out for vehicles with unexplained fresh front-end damage.
