North Yorkshire Police (NYP) is encouraging anyone living in the fear of domestic abuse this festive season to seek help.

Incidents of this type of crime increase throughout December and January, meaning more and more misery for families across the county.

The number of Domestic Abuse related crimes in December 2015 and January 2016 totalled 875 – more than a 10% increase from the previous two months, October and November 2015, when the total number was 774.

Police also know that many incidents of Domestic Abuse are never reported to the police. NYP wants victims to feel confident to enough to report these crimes in the knowledge they will receive they help they so desperately need.

Detective Chief Inspector Allan Harder said:

“Domestic abuse is a devastating crime for all those involved. We know the number of incidents increases over the festive season. This is often down to financial pressures, the stress of Christmas and excess alcohol and drug misuse -but there is never an excuse.

“No-one should feel scared in their own home and I want to anyone who is suffering domestic abuse to know where to get help. Don’t suffer in silence, call the police on 101 and let specially trained officers take steps to make sure you and any children in the home can be protected. If you are in immediate danger, always dial 999”.

If you do not want to involve the police, you can still get help – contact IDAS (Independent Domestic Abuse Service) where you can receive professional support at any time of the day.

You can call the IDAS 24 hour helpline – 03000 110 110 or visit the website for help and advice – https://www.idas.org.uk/

If you are not a victim of Domestic Abuse, but you are concerned that you or a friend or family member may be at risk, then you are also urged to contact police.

Dial 101, Press option 1 and ask about the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme. The scheme, introduced in 2012, aims to protect those vulnerable to domestic abuse by disclosing information about someone’s partner if there are concerns around he or she being violent.
