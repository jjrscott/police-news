Police are appealing for witnesses after offenders caused damage to land and shot a sheep with a high-power rifle in Ryedale.

Between 10pm on Monday 16 May and 5am on Tuesday 17 May, offenders entered land off Malton Road at Marton, near Sinnington.

They caused extensive damage to hedges, crops and a gate before shooting a sheep with a high-power rifle.

The offenders left the sheep suffering in great distress, before the owners found it in the field several hours later. Sadly, its injuries were so severe it had to be euthanised.

Officers from North Yorkshire Police's Rural Taskforce are investigating the incident, and are carrying out extensive enquiries in the area.

Police are appealing for anyone who knows anything about the incident, or saw any suspicious vehicles or people in the area to contact them as a matter of urgency.

Anyone who can assist the investigation is asked to emailneil.cholmondeley@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk, or dial 101, select option 2 and ask for PC Neil Cholmondeley.

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Please quote reference number NYP-17052016-0054 when passing information.
