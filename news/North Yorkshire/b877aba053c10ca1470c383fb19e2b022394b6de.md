It happened at around 4.20am between Tadcaster and Bramham when the lorry left the eastbound carriageway, crossed the central reservation and came to rest on the westbound carriageway.

There were no other vehicles involved and the driver was uninjured.

Anyone with any dash-cam footage, anyone who saw the lorry prior to the crash, or anyone who witnessed the collision is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101 and ask for TC 1532 Richard Harrison or email Richard.harrison@northyorkshire.pnn.co.uk quoting reference 12190160451.

The road was closed to allow recovery of the vehicle and for repairs to be carried out to the central reservation barrier.
