North Yorkshire Police want to make the public aware of a job alert scam.

Facebook users will receive a message usually from a friend that has had their account hacked which reads similar to " Job Alert earn Â£1000 by tomorrow."

The sender will then detail a story whereby a member of their family is setting up a business and to call a number. Upon calling the number the business holder will request personal information and then ask for a number of phone contracts to be undertaken with high priced mobile phones as part of the deal.

They will suggest shops like car phone warehouse, O2 etc with the promise they will cancel the contracts with soft ware in exchange for the phones with the promise of cash. DO NOT BECOME A VICTIM OF THIS SCAM.
