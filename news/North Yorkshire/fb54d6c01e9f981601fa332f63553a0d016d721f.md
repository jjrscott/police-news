Police officers and staff at North Yorkshire Police are backing this year’s White Ribbon campaign to tackle violence against women and girls.

Saturday 25 November was White Ribbon day. It marks International Elimination of Violence Against Women’s Day. The force has pledged its support for the annual White Ribbon campaign, which runs until Sunday 10 December, International Human Rights Day.

During this period, supporters are urged to wear a white ribbon and pledge never to commit, excuse or remain silent about male violence.
