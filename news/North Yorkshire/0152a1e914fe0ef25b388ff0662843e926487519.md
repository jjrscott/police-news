Police are appealing for witnesses and dash-cam footage following a fatal collision on the A64 in York.

The collision occurred just before 5am this morning, Tuesday 4 February 2020, on the westbound carriageway of the A64 next to York Racecourse.

A blue Nissan Juke, a blue Ford Fiesta and a white Vauxhall Viva collided with a pedestrian, a 40-year-old man from Tadcaster, who was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. His family have been informed.

One of the drivers, a 33-year-old man, has been arrested on suspicion of driving while over the prescribed limit for drugs, and for driving while unfit through drugs. He remains in custody at this time.

Officers are appealing for anyone who saw the vehicles or the pedestrian in the moments before the collision, or the collision itself, to contact them. They are particularly interested in speaking to anyone who may have captured dash-cam footage of the incident.

Anyone with any information which could assist the investigation is asked to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, and ask to speak to PC Julie Brown of the Major Collision Investigation Team. You can also email MCIT@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk. Please quote reference 12200019865 when passing information.
