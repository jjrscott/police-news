Officers investigating a collision involving a 12-year-old girl and a motorcycle in York have arrested a man.

A 29-year-old York man was arrested at 8pm yesterday on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and failing to stop. He remains in custody at this time.

The girl is in a critical condition in hospital. Her family are with her, and are being supported by specially-trained police officers.

To recap, at about 5pm on Wednesday 12 June 2019, police received a report of a serious collision on Low Poppleton Lane, York, involving a pedestrian - a 12-year-old girl - and a motorcycle which left the scene.

Officers have had a good response to their appeal for information, and are continuing to urge anyone who witnessed the collision or the motorcycle leaving the scene to contact North Yorkshire Police. They also want to speak to anyone who may have footage of the incident on dashcams, or home- or business-based CCTV systems.

At this time the motorcycle involved has not been recovered. It is believed to be a grey Kawasaki with extensive damage to the frontend and headlight. Anyone who knows where the bike is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police as a matter of urgency.

Please call North Yorkshire Police on 101, quoting NYP-12062019-0335 when passing information.
