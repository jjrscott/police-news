The multi-agency operation to support the Third Stage of the Tour de Yorkshire 2018 has been an overwhelming success.

Commanded by North Yorkshire Police on Saturday (5 May 2018), the race travelled from Richmond to Scarborough with thousands of spectators lining the way.

**Superintendent Dave Hannan** , North Yorkshire Police’s Head of Specialist Operations, said: “It’s been another tremendous day for the Tour de Yorkshire that will live long in the memory of those who experienced the occasion.

“Importantly, it has been enjoyed in a safe and secure environment which is a tribute to the multi-agency effort and the months of planning alongside the organisers Welcome to Yorkshire and Amaury Sport Organisation.

North Yorkshire Police now hands operational command back to West Yorkshire Police for Sunday’s final stage.

While the final leg of the Tour de Yorkshire starts in Halifax and finishes in Leeds in West Yorkshire, North Yorkshire still features heavily on Stage 4 with the Craven, Richmondshire and Harrogate districts taking centre stage.
