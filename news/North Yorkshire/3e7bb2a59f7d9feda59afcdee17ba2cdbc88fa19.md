A dog found abandoned in a car near Otley has been given a new home – thanks to support from kind-hearted residents.

North Yorkshire Police were called to reports that a red Volvo V40 car had been abandoned on Castley Lane, near Otley, in North Yorkshire.

On Sunday 12 February 2017, PC Marie Scott and PCSO Alastair Graham-Merrett, of Knaresborough Neighbourhood Policing Team attended the vehicle, and found a dog inside. Although the dog – a lurcher type cross – was in good health, it had been left alone in the car for around 15 hours.

The dog was taken to a local kennel to be looked after. Enquiries are ongoing to trace the vehicle’s owner, but in the mean time, a member of the local community has come forward and given the dog a new home.

Checks on the vehicle showed it was untaxed and uninsured, and on Tuesday 14 February it was recovered by police and taken away.

Anyone with information about the vehicle is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, quoting reference number 12170024741.
