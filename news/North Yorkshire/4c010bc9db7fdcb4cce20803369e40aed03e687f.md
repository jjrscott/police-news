We are now in a position to name the boy who tragically died on Sunday 27 September 2020, after taking illegal drugs.

He was Josh Reeson, aged 15, from the New Earswick area of York.

We ask that the familyâ€™s privacy is respected at this traumatic time and that the media, nor any other agency, try to contact them.
