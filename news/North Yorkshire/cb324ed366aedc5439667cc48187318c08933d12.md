North Yorkshire Police is working in partnership with Hambleton District Council's "Street Scene" to target the ruination of the local countryside by fly tipping.

Inspector Sarah Sanderson, of Hambleton Neighbourhood Policing team, said: â€œUnder Operation Clean, North Yorkshire Police and Hambleton District Council combined can target the problem together rather than just the council.

"The police have the technology and systems to help identify the offenders so that the council can seek a prosecution. This is a sharper joined-up approach and can achieve so much more than silo working. The sharing of information is crucial to bringing offenders to justice.

"The type of fly tipping would suggest serious organised crime groups are involved, so any information that the public can give is crucial.

"Please call Hambleton District Council on 01609 779977 or the Police on 101 with any information you have, or anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555111."
