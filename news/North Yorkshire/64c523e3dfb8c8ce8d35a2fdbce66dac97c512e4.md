North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a burglary that occurred in Wigginton which left a young triathlete without their bike.

It happened overnight between Wednesday 8 and Thursday 9 November 2017 when a garage on Green Dikes, Wigginton was broken in to and a white and black adult's Cube Attain bike and black and red child's Giant Defy bike were taken.

The child's bike is marked using the north Yorkshire Police dot peen system so is easily traceable.
