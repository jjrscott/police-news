Police investigating a collision involving a motorbike and a car have renewed their appeal in a bid to trace the driver of a black Audi, who was overtaken shortly before the crash.

The rider - a woman in her 30s from Catterick Garrison - was travelling along Reeth Road from Richmond on a green Suzuki when she collided with a white Volvo C60.

Both vehicles were travelling in the same direction - westbound along Reeth Road.

The Audi driver was not involved in the collision. But officers believe he or she may have vital information that could help them piece together events in the moments leading up to the incident.

The collision took place, at around 1.20pm on Saturday (7 May 2016) near River Meadow Cottage.

The woman suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital in Darlington. She has now been released and is recovering at home.

Anyone with information is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option two from the voice menu and ask for Tony Leonard. You can also email Tony.Leonard@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
