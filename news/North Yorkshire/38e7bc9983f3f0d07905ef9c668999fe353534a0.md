North Yorkshire Police (NYP) is the first force to successfully secure two Sexual Risk Orders (SROs).

The orders, part of new legislation which came into effect on 8 March 2015, allow the Police and National Crime Agency (NCA) to apply for the measures against anyone who, despite them having no criminal convictions, is deemed to pose a risk of sexual harm.

Working closely with partner agencies to secure evidence in support of applications for SROs, NYP will make substantial use of the new orders as another way to protect the communities of North Yorkshire.

Superintendent Nigel Costello, Head of Protecting Vulnerable People, said:

"The new Sexual Risk Orders (SROs) are a positive step in ensuring the police have as many measures as possible at their disposal to ensure we can protect those vulnerable people in our communities and keep people safe from harm.

"Our Criminal and Civil Orders officer worked extremely hard with the Home Office to develop the guidance and processes surrounding these orders and I am pleased that we have been able to already secure two of these orders, and that we are the first force in the country to use them.

"It demonstrates our commitment to the relentless pursuit of those who we believe will commit crime and cause harm."
