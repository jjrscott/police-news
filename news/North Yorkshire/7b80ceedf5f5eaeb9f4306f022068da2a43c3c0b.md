York residents are being urged to check their outbuilding security after several incidents in New Earswick over the weekend.

Police received a number of reports of suspicious activity around garden sheds in the village in the early hours of Sunday 23 April 2017.

Officers responded immediately and carried out an area search, although no one was located. Enquiries are ongoing and reassurance patrols are being conducted in the area by York Outer Neighbourhood Policing Team.

Residents are being urged to review their outbuilding security arrangements. Consider external lighting and shed alarms, ensure doors and gates are kept locked, and all valuable items should be security-marked.

Visit www.northyorkshire.police.uk/staying-safe/home-security/outbuilding-security for more advice and information.

Inspector Lee Pointon, of York Outer Neighbourhood Policing Team, added: "Marking your property is one of the most effective ways to protect yourself from being a victim of crime, and we carry out regular tool marking events in York.

"When a criminal spots the permanent unique number on one of the tens of thousands of items we have already marked, they will know straight away that it is too hot to handle. If the worst happened and something was stolen, marked property is far harder to sell on, and we are much more likely to be able to return it to you if we recover it."
