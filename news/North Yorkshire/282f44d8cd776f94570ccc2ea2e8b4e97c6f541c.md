Reckless suspects jumped from a moving HGV onto the motorway after police tried to stop it in North Yorkshire.

At about 1.20am this morning, officers noticed a Mercedes-Benz Axor HGV in suspicious circumstances. As it travelled along the A1(M) north of Leeming Bar, it failed to stop for police.

Less than a minute later, five people dressed in black jumped from the HGV while it was still moving in lane 2. It then left the road into a grass verge, before coming to a stop.

The suspects ran off across the road into fields towards Little Fencote. Despite extensive searches carried out by a police dog and the NPAS police helicopter, they were not located.

The HGV has been recovered, and seized for forensic examination, and enquiries are ongoing into the incident.

A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: “Jumping from a moving lorry and letting it crash off the motorway was an extremely reckless act that could have had very serious consequences. Although no suspects have been located at this time, it’s highly likely that our response has disrupted criminal activity overnight. Enquiries are ongoing to identify those responsible.”
