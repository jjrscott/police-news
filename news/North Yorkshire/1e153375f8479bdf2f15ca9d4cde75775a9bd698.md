North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a sexual assault that occurred in York.

It happened at approximately 3:40pm on Saturday 7 May 2016 near WH Smiths. A woman in her twenties was the victim of a sexual assault as she walked along a busy shopping street. She confronted a man and a woman who she believed to be responsible. They walked away laughing.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the public's assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about the couple seen by the victim. The man was white, around 5ft 8â€³ in height, of medium build with short dark hair. He was wearing a dark polo shirt, with tattoos on one or both of his arms. The woman was white, slightly taller than the man, medium build, with long straight fair hair.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for PC 292 Alastair Foy. You can also email alastair.foy@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
