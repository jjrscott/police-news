Community-spirited members of the public in Bedale are being invited to join North Yorkshire Police in the fight against rural crime.

The local Safer Neighbourhood Team operates a Mobile Watch scheme, which encourages residents using their own vehicles to keep an eye on rural areas, particularly after dark.

Watch members record any suspicious vehicles they come across, and pass the information to the police. If a more urgent response is required, immediate contact with the police can be made using a radio.

All participants of the scheme must sign a Code of Conduct before joining, and undergo a short vetting process.

PCSO Bryan Tongue, of Bedale Police, co-ordinates the scheme. He said: "The Mobile Watch scheme currently has six active members, and we're incredibly grateful for the support and local knowledge that they provide. We are now looking for additional members so we can roll the Watch out even further."
