Two men have been arrested in Skipton on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs.

Just before midday on Wednesday 6 May 2020, an officer on patrol noticed a VW Golf car in suspicious circumstances on Carleton Road in Skipton. The vehicle came to a stop on Keighley Road, and one man got out, after which the car drove off.

The officer detained the first man, and radioed for other patrols in the area to look out for the car. A few minutes later, it was stopped by another officer on Keighley Road, and its driver was also detained.

Both men, aged 49 and 42, and from Skipton, were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs.

Several bags containing suspected drugs were found on both men.

They have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
