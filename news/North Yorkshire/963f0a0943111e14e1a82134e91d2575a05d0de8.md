Police are seeking to identify the owners of suspected stolen power tools that were recovered following arrests in Whitby.

Overnight on Saturday 22 to Sunday 23 April 2017, a series of works vans were broken into in the Bridlington area of Humberside and the Scarborough and Whitby areas of North Yorkshire.

A van was subsequently stopped in Whitby that contained a large amount of power tools. Most have been identified from previously reported crimes, however there are a number of outstanding items that police believe are stolen, but may not have been reported.

Five men from the West Yorkshire area were arrested in connection with this incident and remain under investigation while enquiries continue.

Anyone that recognises the tools and had them stolen in April is asked to contact Investigator 4463 Rob Henderson at the Scarborough Investigation Hub. Please dial 101 and select option 2, or 01609 643421. Quote reference 12170069010 when passing information.
