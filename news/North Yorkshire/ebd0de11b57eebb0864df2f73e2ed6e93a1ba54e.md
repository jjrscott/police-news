Police are appealing for witnesses and information after a man was arrested for criminal damage and animal welfare offences in Harrogate.

Officers were called to an incident on Woodfield Road, Harrogate, at about 7.30pm on Monday 2 December 2019.

It was reported that a man had damaged a number of vehicles along the road, using a ferret box to hit them, and had also thrown a pair of ferrets at a vehicle.

A 25-year-old man, of no fixed address, was detained by members of the public, and arrested by police on suspicion of criminal damage and causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.

At least a dozen vehicles were damaged, including smashed windows, dents and scratches.

The two ferrets are now in the care of the RSPCA.
