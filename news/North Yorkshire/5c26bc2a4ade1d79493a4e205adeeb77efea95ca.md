North Yorkshire Police officers yesterday (Sunday 17 May) responded to reports of drug-related activity at two Scarborough properties and subsequently arrested three men believed to be linked to a key County Lines drug operation.

An 18 year old man from Sandwell in the West Midlands was arrested at a residential address in Alma Square on suspicion of being involved in the supply of class A drugs and remains in police custody.

Officers then attended a residential address on Victoria Road where they arrested a 19 year old man from the Erdington area of Birmingham on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs and a 48 year old man from Scarborough on suspicion of possessing class A drugs with intent to supply. Both men have been released on conditional bail.

A further individual, a 36 year old Scarborough man, has been arrested today (18 May) in connection with this investigation and on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs. He is currently in police custody.

Members of the public provide invaluable information that helps shape our operational activity and we urge residents to look out for the signs of cuckooing in their neighbourhood and report any concerns they have. Signs to look out for include:

 * Increased callers at a property
 * Increase in cars pulling up for short periods of time
 * Different accents at a property
 * Increased antisocial behaviour at a property
 * Not seeing the resident for long periods of time
 * Unfamiliar vehicles at the property
 * Windows covered or curtains closed for long periods
 * Communal doors propped open

Call North Yorkshire Police on 101. If you prefer not to speak to the police and wish to remain anonymous, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. If you or another person is in immediate danger, always call 999.

“County lines” is the term given to a form of organised crime in which drug dealers from urban areas exploit vulnerable people - including children - and force them to deal drugs in smaller towns and cities. It takes its name from the mobile phone lines used by dealers to communicate between towns, take orders & conduct their “business”. The lines are used to advertise drugs for sale and mass text messages are sent to users letting them know where and when they can buy drugs. The lines become valuable protected “brands”. Violence and intimidation is prevalent within county lines. Due to the exploitation of vulnerable people associated with it, it is a key, operational priority for North Yorkshire Police.
