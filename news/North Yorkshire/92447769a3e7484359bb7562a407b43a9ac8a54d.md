North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information regarding a vehicle that failed to stop for officers in Scarborough.

It happened around 11:25pm on Friday 27 September when an officer sighted a white Honda Civic travelling at speed along Marine Drive. When requested to stop, the Civic made off at speed towards the Peasholm area. It was located abandoned a short distance away on Peasholm Gardens.

A 22-year old male was arrested at the time and has since been released under investigation whilst enquiries continue. The vehicle has been seized by police.

Investigating officer PC Liam Cromack, said, "Whilst we have arrested one person in relation to this offence, I am still keen to hear from anyone who remembers seeing the vehicle on the evening in question, particularly if it was being driven at the time. Any information you can provide could prove useful in opening up further avenues of investigation."

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation, including any dash-cam or CCTV taken in the areas at the time should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Liam Cromack. You can also email liam.cromack@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
