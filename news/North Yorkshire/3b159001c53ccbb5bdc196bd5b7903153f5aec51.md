Police are appealing for witnesses after a man indecently exposed himself in Harrogate.

At around 2.30pm on Tuesday 11 August 2015, a 52-year-old local woman saw a man exposing himself near some bushes in Walkers Passage, near Harcourt Road Nursery.

The man is described as white, aged in his mid-20s, around 5ft 8in tall, with a slim build and short ginger hair. He had a scruffy appearance and was wearing a black t-shirt, jeans and white trainers. He was possibly carrying a black bag.

Officers believe that there were likely to have been a few people in the area around the time of the incident and are urging anyone else who saw the man to get in touch.

Anyone who can help officers with their enquiries is urged to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101 - select option 2 - and ask for PC Amanda Hanusch-Moore or Harrogate police.

If you prefer not to give your name, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Please quote reference number 12150139637 when passing information about this incident.
