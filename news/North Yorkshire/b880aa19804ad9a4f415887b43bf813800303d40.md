Police in North Yorkshire will mark International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Interphobia and Transphobia (IDAHOBIT) this Sunday.

17th May was chosen to commemorate the World Health Organisation’s decision to declassify homosexuality as a mental disorder – in 1990, thirty years ago to the day.

Although times have changed since then, IDAHOBIT is all about raising awareness of the LGBT+ community and recognising that there are still challenges to face and work to be done.

PC Stuart Henderson, Hate Crime Co-ordinator for North Yorkshire Police, said: “In these unique times we find ourselves, it is more important than ever that we acknowledge our LGBTQ+ community.

“North Yorkshire Police work alongside a number of partner agencies such as Yorkshire MESMAC and the York LGBT Forum who support LGBTQ+ individuals within North Yorkshire and the City of York.

“I would urge anyone who is finding it particularly difficult at this time to reach out to these organisations or others for support. I would also urge those who may have been the victim of a hate crime to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, or alternatively one of the third party reporting centres such as Supporting Victims – North and True Vison. Both have the option to report online or by phone.”
