Police are urging Selby residents to take extra security steps after a recent increase in shed and outbuilding burglaries.

Since the beginning of December 2015, the Abbots Road Estate - predominately Volta Street, Cochrane Street, D'Arcy Road and Stonebridge Allotments - has been subjected to a series of shed and outbuilding burglaries.

Property stolen in these burglaries includes tools, gardening equipment and bicycles.

Officers are investigating the burglaries and are asking residents to remain vigilant, and to report any suspicious activity, including anyone offering any items for sale door-to-door in the area, to police by dialling 101, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Regular police patrols are taking place in the areas affected.

If you have any information regarding these crimes, or wish to speak to a local community officer regarding crime prevention advice, please contact PCSO Anneliese Ryan (anneliese.ryan@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk) or PCSO Rosie Whitton (rosie.whitton@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk) via email or 101.
