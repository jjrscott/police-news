Officers are re-issuing their appeal for witnesses after a serious collision between Bishop Thornton and Markington, near Harrogate has led to the death of a couple in their seventies.

The incident happened around 3.30pm on Wednesday 20 November 2019 on the Fountains Abbey Road between Bishop Thornton and Markington at the ‘Drover’s Crossroads’.

It involved a yellow Fiat 500 which was travelling from Bishop Thornton towards Markington and a black VW Up which was travelling along Fountains Abbey Road from the direction of Ripley.

The occupants of the VW, a 74-year-old female driver and her 77-year-old husband, who was a passenger in the car, have now sadly died from their injuries in hospital.

The 47-year-old female driver of the Fiat was admitted to Harrogate District Hospital with serious injuries. She has now been discharged. Her 67-year-old mother who was a passenger in the same car, was also taken to Harrogate District Hospital where she was treated and later discharged.

The road was closed for nine hours whilst police examined the scene and we would like to thank the public for their patience, as the closure involved a long diversion at a busy time of day.

Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone who saw either vehicle prior to the collision or may have dashcam footage, to get in touch.

If you have any information which may assist this investigation please email MCIT@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk or call 101, press 2 and ask to speak to the Major Collision Investigation Team.

Please quote North Yorkshire Police reference number 12190213752.
