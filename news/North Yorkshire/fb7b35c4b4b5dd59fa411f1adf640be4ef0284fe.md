For awareness and reassurance to residents, visitors and business owners in York city centre, North Yorkshire Police can confirm that a police firearms training exercise is taking place this evening (Wednesday 3 April 2019) from around 7pm to midnight.

We realise the presence of lots of police vehicles and armed officers may cause concern and alarm.

This is why we are putting out this message on the force website and on social media to help explain that it is only an exercise and that there is no need to be worried.

Nearby residents and business owners have already been leafleted and informed in person where possible.

Our Force Control Room have been briefed to refer any callers about the firearms training exercise in York to the force website and social media channels.

Thank you for your support and we hope that any disruption in York city centre is kept to a minimum.
