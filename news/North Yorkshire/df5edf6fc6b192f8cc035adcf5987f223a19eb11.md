The latest North Yorkshire Police webchat will give residents in Stokesley the chance to ask questions about policing, crime and anti-social behaviour in the area.

Inspector David Murray and Sergeant Nick Hill will host the Lunchtime Live webchat between 12pm and 1pm on Monday 24 August 2015.

They will be online to discuss peoples' experiences with Stokesley police and to talk about how the policing service in the town can be further improved.

Last year, 1,044 people attended online webchats with North Yorkshire Police, chatting with local teams and discussing topics including biker safety, firearms licensing and the Special Constabulary. A total of 471 questions and comments were received in 2014; transcripts of the webchats are also available to download, and in 2014 these were accessed more than 3,500 times.

Inspector Murray said: "Lunchtime Live webchats are an excellent way of engaging and communicating with our residents, allowing us to address the issues that concern local communities the most, and we will do our best to answer any questions that come our way. For those who can't attend the online event, there are also plenty of opportunities to meet your local police face-to-face as well."

To join the webchat visit www.northyorkshire.police.uk/lunchtimelivebetween 12pm and 1pm on Monday 24 August 2015.
