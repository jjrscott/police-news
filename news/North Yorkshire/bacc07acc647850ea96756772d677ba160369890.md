Police are appealing for witnesses to a fail-to-stop collision involving a car and a pedestrian in Richmond Market Place in the early hours of New Year's Day.

At about 1.30am on 1 January 2017, a 20-year-old woman was walking across the Market Place on the cobbles when a car collided with her at low speed. She was knocked to the ground, although she was not seriously injured.

The vehicle involved is believed to have been a white, 66-plate BMW. It is believed to have left the Market Place down King Street, passed Wetherspoons and turned right onto Dundas Street.

Police are appealing for anyone with information about the collision, or who can identify the vehicle, to contact them. Please call 101, select option 2 and ask for PC 1707 Alan Fenney or quote reference number 12170000289.
