North Yorkshire Police seeing a worrying increase in scam which uses ‘cloned’ banking websites.

North Yorkshire Police has seen a rise in the number of people who have lost large amounts of money after transferring funds to fraudsters posing as bona fide banking or financial institutions.

Fraudsters target individuals who may be looking for a better return on their savings by creating fake investment funds or bonds and cloning the websites of leading banks so that the victim is tricked into thinking they are transferring their money to a legitimate organisation.

Often, the scammers will also create fake investment comparison websites which ask the individual to input a name and contact number in order to view the results of their comparison. The fraudsters will then call the individual, discuss their ‘investment opportunities’ and continue communication by email and documents which eventually direct them to the cloned website to make the transfer of the funds.

One example of this taking place in North Yorkshire, is an individual who transferred in excess of £30,000 to a bank account controlled by criminals in the mistaken belief they were investing in a ‘bond’ offered by a world-renowned bank. Officers are also aware of other people up and down the country who have lost up to £100,000 in this same scam.

Kevin Ross from North Yorkshire Police’s Economic Crime Unit, said:

“These are devious and sophisticated crimes –even the most wary can be taken in and with most people currently having more time on their hands than normal, we are warning vigilance with any financial activity – particularly investments. Here’s our top tips to safeguard your money:

 * Treat every phone call received with suspicion, and monitor the Financial Conduct Authority website, for up to date information about these crimes and what types of scams to look out for.
 * Consider taking independent financial advice before parting with any money.
 * Contact the organisation you think you are dealing with direct by finding the number for their head office.
 * Do not use the contact details you may have been given over the phone or email.
 * Under no circumstances send money until you have completely verified from a separate source that you are actually sending money to ‘ABC Bank’, or whoever you believe you are dealing with.”

If you are concerned that you have been a victim of an investment fraud scam or other scam then please report this to North Yorkshire Police on 101.
