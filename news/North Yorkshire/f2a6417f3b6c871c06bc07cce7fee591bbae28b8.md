Steven John Briddon of Rose Street, York pleaded guilty to causing injury due to dangerous driving and was sentenced to 32 months in prison and a four year and four month ban from driving.

At 9.15pm on Thursday 1 October, 28-year-old Briddon drove his Toyota MR2 at speeds approaching 60mph through York City Centre. He lost control of his car and hit a female moped rider near the traffic lights at the junction of Jewbury and Monk Bar.

The rider of the moped, a 49-year-old woman from York sustained life threatening injuries and was taken to Leeds General Infirmary, where she remained in a serious condition for some time.

Commenting on the outcome of the case Sgt Dave Foster of the Major Collision Investigation Team said:

"The sentence that was passed today reflects the fact that Briddon paid absolutely no regard to the risk he was placing other road users in, by driving so irresponsibly and dangerously that night. This was a horrific collision that was caused by excessive speed and was completely avoidable. It resulted in an innocent woman's life being put at risk and has left her with serious and sustained injuries.

"North Yorkshire Police will not tolerate such irresponsible driving on our roads and we will look to uphold the law and prosecute anyone who drives in such a dangerous way"
