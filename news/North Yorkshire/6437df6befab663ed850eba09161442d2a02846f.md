North Yorkshire Police can confirm that the 23-year-old motorcycle rider involved in the collision with a white Toyota Yaris on Dunslow Road, Eastfield, Scarborough, at 7.22pm on Friday (21 August 2015), has sadly died at Scarborough Hospital.

We are not in a position to name him at this time.

Officers are renewing their appeal for witnesses and information to assist the investigation.

In particular, they are asking people to come forward who recall seeing the distinctive motorcycle - ***** a black Honda CB600 Hornet with a silver frame and blue piping - prior to the collision on the A64 as it travelled towards Scarborough from Malton. Or as it entered Dunslow Road in the direction of Cayton as it approached the collision scene outside the Vantage Toyota garage.

If you can help, please call North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Martin Mulcaster or the Major Collision Investigation Team. Or email martin.mulcaster@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

**23 August 2015 - 5.05pm**

***** _Please note the changed description of the motorcycle and the investigating officer from the initial appeal_
