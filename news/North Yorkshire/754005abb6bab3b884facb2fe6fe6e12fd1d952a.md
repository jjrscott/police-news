It happened at the bus stop outside Scarborough railway station at 9.05am on Tuesday, 1 May 2018.

The victim was approached by a man who asked for money.

When the victim refused, the suspect produced a knife.

The suspect left the scene empty handed after been deterred by a woman who was passing.
