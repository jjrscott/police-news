Police are appealing for witnesses after a cash machine was damaged in Hawes in the early hours of today.

At about 12.20am on Wednesday 5 June 2019, police were called with a report that an ATM in the Market Place appeared to be on fire.

Officers conducted a search of the area, but no suspects were located.

North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service colleagues attended and extinguished the flames.

It is not believed any cash was taken from the machine.

Police are appealing for anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area overnight to get in touch. In particular, officers want to trace an old-style dark-coloured Land Rover Discovery that left Hawes in the direction of Bainbridge around the time of the incident.

Inspector Mark Gee, of Richmondshire Police, said :"Officers are in Hawes today conducting house-to-house and CCTV enquiries, and to provide reassurance to residents. I'm appealing for anyone with information about this incident to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, quoting reference 12190100901."
