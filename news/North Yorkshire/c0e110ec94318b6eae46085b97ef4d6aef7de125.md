Police are appealing for witnesses and information about a robbery in Scarborough.

At about 11.25pm on Friday 28 October 2016, a woman was walking along Colescliffe Road carrying a crate of beer and some carrier bags.

She was approached by a group of people, including a man, a woman and a large number of youths. The man asked her if he could buy a can of beer. The victim refused, and tried to leave, but the man grabbed her from behind and tried to snatch one of the carrier bags from her. The bag ripped, and the group then fled the area.

Despite extensive enquiries, police have not yet been able to identify the suspects, and the investigation into the incident is ongoing.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police. Please dial 101, select option 2 and ask for DC Alex Parker or Scarborough Serious Crime Team, or email alex.parker@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Please quote reference number 12160196244 when passing information.
