Officers are appealing for information, witnesses and dash-cam footage following a fatal collision near Wormald Green on the A61 at the weekend.

The incident occurred just before 10.30pm on Saturday, 3 November and involved a pedestrian, a man in his 30s, and a Toyota Yaris. Sadly the pedestrian was pronounced dead at the scene.

Officers would like to speak with anyone who was driving in this area from around 8.30pm on Saturday who may have seen a man walking in the road as this could assist with their investigation.

Police are specifically seeking a taxi driver who may have seen the man earlier in the evening.

The driver of the car, a man in his 80s, was not injured and is helping police with their enquiries.

Anyone who can assist with the investigation is urged to contact North Yorkshire Police Traffic Constable Gemma Brett (1470) gemma.brett@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk or Traffic Sergeant Hamish Halloway (1170) Hamish.halloway@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk quoting reference 12180206063.
