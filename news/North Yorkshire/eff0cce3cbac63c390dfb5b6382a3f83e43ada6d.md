Police in York arrested two men on suspicion of stealing parking meters last night (13 July 2017) thanks to the vigilance of members of the public.

At around 9.15pm, police received a call from a member of the public reporting that a van had crashed into a parking meter on Wigginton Road and the occupants had then loaded the meter into the van.

A short time later, officers received a further report of a similar incident in Carlisle Street car park.

Officers attended the scene in Carlisle Street and arrested two suspects following a short foot chase.

They also recovered an angle grinder from the scene.

The arrested men include a 19-year-old man of no fixed address and a 22-year-old man from Doncaster. They have been released while under investigation.

Inspector Lee Pointon of York Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: “My thanks go to the vigilant members of public who called in with the information. It’s a classic example of how police are supported by the public who act as our eyes and ears.”
