The 3rd of March is International Sex Workers' Rights Day - a day recognised and celebrated by sex worker groups all over the world.

In 2019, North Yorkshire Police adopted crimes against sex workers into its official policy for tackling and dealing with hate crime.
The force is committed to working with partner agencies to safeguard sex workers, minimise harm and prevent crime committed against them.

Some sex workers are targeted by dangerous individuals who are often serial sexual predators who pose significant risks to the public as a whole.
We want to inform those who work in the sex industry about keeping safe, what to do if they are a victim of crime, and also what support is available for them if they are reluctant to report these incidents to the police.

If you work in the sex industry we would encourage you to sign up to **National Ugly Mugs (NUM)** via **https://uglymugs.org/um/**
This is a free service which will enable you to report incidents and receive warnings about dangerous individuals. Your report could potentially save a life.
For more information about the support that is available to anyone who works in the sex industry, please visit the North Yorkshire Police website **www.northyorkshire.police.uk/sexworkersafety **
