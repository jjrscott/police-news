A man from Cleveland who scammed an elderly woman out of more than £100 cash, has been sentenced to 16 months in prison.

Richard Calvert, 45, travelled into North Yorkshire from Cleveland to commit the offence in March last year.

On 9 March 2019, Calvert targeted an 81 year old woman in Kirkbymoorside, fooling her into believing she knew him. He then followed her home, went into her house and scammed her out of £120 cash, leading the victim to believe that he would go back and do some gardening work for her.

Calvert was sentenced at York Crown Court yesterday.
