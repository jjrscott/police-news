An innovative pilot for a new service to keep residents of North Yorkshire and York safe and feeling safe has been launched in Craven.

The Public Safety Service brings together a number of organisations, currently including North Yorkshire Police, Yorkshire Ambulance Service and North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service to help prevent vulnerability and reduce harm and to improve the safety and resilience of our communities.

The scheme, which has been introduced by the North Yorkshire Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner, is being piloted for 12 months in the Craven district with the intention of rolling it out across the whole county and city.

Two Public Safety Officers, working across all these agencies, were appointed in February 2020 and have been embedded in local communities to provide support and improve capacity to tackle issues before they become problematic.

The main focus of their role is providing crime prevention, fire safety and health and wellbeing information, and supporting community problem solving.

They are also on-call firefighters and so will be on call with the local fire service crews at Bentham and Grassington as well as being emergency first responders for Yorkshire Ambulance Service and being part of the local policing team providing early intervention and monitoring antisocial behaviour.

Their contact details are below:
