A man appeared at Scarborough Magistrates Court on Monday 13 February 2017, charged with drug driving and failing to provide a specimen.

Daniel Johnson, 24-years-old of West Park Terrace, Scarborough was stopped by officers from North Yorkshire Roads Policing Group on New Years Eve 2016. A road side drug wipe test was conducted and proved positive for cannabis. Johnson was arrested and bailed whilst police awaited the results of further blood tests. These tests later found that Johnson was actually eight times the legal limit for cannabis (16ug per 100ml of blood – legal limit is 2ug per 100ml)

Whilst on bail for the original drug driving offence, Johnson was stopped again by police on the 12 February 2017 in Pickering on suspicion of the same offence. Another roadside test returned a positive result for cannabis. However, when in custody Johnson refused to provide a blood sample and was charged with the offence of failing to provide.

He was dealt with immediately at Scarborough Magistrates Court and found guilty of both offences. He received a driving ban of two years and ordered to pay a total of £500 in fines and £105 in associated charges.

TC Jamie Lord of the Roads Policing Group said: “The court's decision is a clear message that drug driving will not be tolerated. If North Yorkshire Police have information that people are using drugs and driving we will target them, arrest them and put them in front of the courts. These irresponsible drivers who risk the safety of others need to know that a driving licence is a privilege and not a right. If you abuse that privilege, you lose the licence.”
