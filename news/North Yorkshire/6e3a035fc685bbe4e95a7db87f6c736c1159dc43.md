North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about an assault that occurred in Burnside Avenue, Skipton near to the entrance to Brooklands School.

The assault approximately 4.55pm on Thursday 25 October 2018 and involved two men in their late teens to early 20's. One of the men was pushing a mountain bike.

The two men carried out an unprovoked attack on another man who was walking with a woman towards the footbridge over the railway line toward Carleton Road.

We are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information from anyone who witnessed this attack. The victim was knocked to the ground and sustained a prolonged assault during which he was kicked and punched whilst he lay on the ground. Eventually he managed to get to his feet and the suspects fled down Burnside Avenue.

Investigating officer PC Rich Sutcliffe said "This nasty assault took place in a quiet residential area in broad daylight at a time when families and school children would be in the area. The incident would have been quite shocking to see and I am sure that anyone passing by would have noticed this taking place. I would appeal to anyone who witnessed the attack or has any information which would assist theinvestigation get in touch."

Anyone with information should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Richard Sutcliffe. You can also email richard.sutcliffe@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
