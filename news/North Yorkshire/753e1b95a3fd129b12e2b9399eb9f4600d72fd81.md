A 26-year-old man from Scarborough is being held in police custody in connection with an alleged assault on an off-duty police officer.

The incident occurred outside Squireâ€™s carpet shop on Victoria Road at 6.39am on Friday (3 April 2020).

The suspect, who was bare chested and wearing tracksuit bottoms, was reported to have violently confronted the off-duty officer and tried to throw a bag of vomit over him.
