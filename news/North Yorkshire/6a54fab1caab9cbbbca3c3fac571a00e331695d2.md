Police are appealing for witnesses and dash-cam footage after a fatal collision on the A64.

At about 10.50am on Thursday 8 August 2019, a collision occurred on the A64 near Scagglethorpe, between Malton and Rillington. It involved a grey Hyundai Tucson, a car-transporter vehicle and a heavy goods vehicle.

Sadly, the driver of the car, a 61-year-old man from the Sheffield area, suffered fatal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene. His family have been informed.

Two children in the car, a boy aged 10 and a girl aged 9, were also injured. Yorkshire Ambulance Service deployed two ambulances and the Yorkshire Air Ambulance to the scene and transported the two children to hospital. Their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.

Diversions were put in place while the emergency services tended to casualties and to allow collision investigators to examine the scene. The road re-opened just after 5pm.

Anyone who witnessed the collision, or has any dash-cam footage that may show any of the vehicles involved prior to it, is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police. Please dial 101, select option 2, and ask for the Major Collision Investigation Team, or email mcit@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
