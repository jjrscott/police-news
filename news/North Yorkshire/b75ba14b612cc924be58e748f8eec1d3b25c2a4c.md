Four people have been arrested on suspicion of supplying drugs after police executed a warrant in Selby.

On the morning of Monday 3 July 2017, officers from the Selby Town Neighbourhood Policing Team executed a warrant under the Misuse of Drugs Act at a property on Primrose Grove in the town.

A quantity of Class A and B drugs were found, and three men and a woman were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A and Class B drugs. They have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

Leaflets were distributed to local residents informing them of the action taken, and officers will continue to conduct reassurance patrols in the area.

Sergeant Jackie Booth, of Selby Town Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We are committed to working with local residents to address issues affecting your neighbourhood. Should you wish to speak to a member of the team about crime or anti-social behaviour in your community, please contact us by emailing snaselby@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk. Alternatively, if you wish to report information anonymously, please contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
