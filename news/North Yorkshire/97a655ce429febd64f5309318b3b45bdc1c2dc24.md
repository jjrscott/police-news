We can confirm that the serving North Yorkshire Police officer who died on Sunday 7 October 2018 was PC 1066 Mick Atkinson.

Chief Constable Lisa Winward said:

“It was with great sadness that I learnt of PC Mick Atkinson’s sudden and tragic death this weekend.

“Mick was a distinguished officer and had been part of the North Yorkshire Police family for 17 years. He started his service as Police Constable in Scarborough and then moved into the Dog Support Unit and became a handler. He was a well-liked and much respected member of the team and of our wider policing family and his loss will be felt profoundly.

“His death has come as a great shock to all of us and our thoughts are with his family, friends and colleagues at this extremely difficult time.”

Police do not believe there are any suspicious circumstances around PC Atkinson's death.
