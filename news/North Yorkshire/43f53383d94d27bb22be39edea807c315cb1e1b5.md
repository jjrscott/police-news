Police have arrested two suspects after an attempted robbery at a post office in Embsay, Skipton.

At about 5.20pm on Monday 1 April 2019, two people wearing balaclavas entered the store on East Lane and brandished a knife. They were told to get out, ran off empty-handed, and drove away in a vehicle.

In the early hours of Wednesday 3 April, North Yorkshire Police officers arrested a 18-year-old man and a 16-year-old boy in the Keighley area, both on suspicion of attempted robbery.

They were taken into custody and subsequently released under investigation as enquiries into the incident continue.
