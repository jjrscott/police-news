North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses to a fatal collision between a motorcycle and pedal cycle in the Settle area.

The incident occurred on the unclassified road between Wigglesworth and Rathmell at around 10.39am on Sunday (24 June 2018).

The pedal cyclist and the motorcycle were travelling in the same direction from Wigglesworth towards Rathmell, with the collision occurring as the motorcycle approached from behind.

Both men sustained life-threatening injuries and were airlifted from the scene.

Sadly, the rider of the Suzuki GSX-R motorcycle, a 36-year-old man from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, died at Leeds General Infirmary.

The pedal cyclist, a 61-year-old man from Colne, is in a serious but stable condition at Royal Preston Hospital.

The road re-opened at 2.50pm after the police completed a collision scene investigation.

Officers are appealing for witnesses to the collision to come forward, as well as anyone who recalls seeing the manner of riding of either vehicle prior to the collision.

They also wish to thank the members of the public who stopped at the scene and assisted in administering first aid.

If you can help the investigation, please call North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Pete Stringer. Or email pete.stringer@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk. Please quote reference 12180112782.
