Police have issued e-fit images of two suspects who were involved in an incident in York.

On Tuesday 30 October 2018, at about 4am, a woman was walking through The Groves area of York when she was approached by a silver vehicle with tinted rear passenger windows. The driver and the front passenger tried to interact with the woman, which she ignored.

The woman then heard a car door shut, and footsteps catching up with her. Moments later she was grabbed from behind. She reacted by biting the right forearm of the suspect. This is believed to have left a mark, as the contact was directly to the skin.

Officers are appealing for anyone who recognises the computer-generated images of the two men involved, or has any information about the incident, to come forward.

Anyone with information should contact York Serious Crime Team. Call North Yorkshire Police on 101, and select option 2 - or email sctyork@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk. Please quote reference number 12180203855.
