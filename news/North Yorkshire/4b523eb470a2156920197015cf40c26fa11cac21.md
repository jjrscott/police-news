North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a theft of paving stones that occurred in Pannal. We particularly would like to speak to a female who had seen a suspicious car parked around the corner from the theft.

The incident took place on Rossett Green Lane at 11:15am on Saturday 6 August 2016 and involved a white Mercedes Sprinter van and a black Vauxhall Astra.

The occupants of the address returned to their property and disturbed five men who were in the process of taking a number of Yorkshire stone slabs, from the rear of the property.

Four men ran from the address in the direction of Yew Tree Lane, where at least one of the men was seen to get into the black Vauxhall Astra.

The fifth man got into the white Mercedes Sprinter van, which also went into the direction of Yew Tree Lane.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101 and ask to speak to Simon Davy or email simon.davy589@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
