North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses following a fatal road traffic collision in Crambeck on 13 May 2017.

The collision happened just before midnight on the A64 at Crambeck near to Malton and involved a black Renault minibus and two pedestrians.

The minibus was travelling westbound towards York when it struck the two pedestrians who had just alighted from a Coastliner double-decker bus and were crossing the A64.

Sadly, the pedestrians, a 52-year-old woman and 51-year-old-man from the Malton area were pronounced dead at the scene.

Anyone who witnessed the collision, or has any information, is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask to Emma Drummond or Mark Mullins.

In particular we would like to speak to anyone who saw the Renault minibus at any time during the evening or the Coastliner bus in the Crambeck area.

Alternatively, please email emma.drummond@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk or mark.mullins@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk.

Please quote reference 12170082711 when passing on information.
