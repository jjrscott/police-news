Police are appealing to find the owners of jewellery that was recovered after three suspected burglars were arrested by police.

The items pictured below were recovered after the arrests in Whitley near Selby on 3 January 2019.

They are believed to have been taken during two burglaries at homes in South Duffield, North Yorkshire, and Everingham, East Yorkshire earlier that day.

Officers are trying to trace the owners of rings, earrings, chains, watches and other items which were recovered during the investigation.

Three men – two in their 30s and one in his 20s – will appear before York Crown Court next month charged with burglary.

Anyone who recognises the items pictured should contact DC Paul Carey or PSI Dave Pegg at North Yorkshire Police by calling 101, selecting option 2 and asking for them by name. You can also email david.pegg@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk.
