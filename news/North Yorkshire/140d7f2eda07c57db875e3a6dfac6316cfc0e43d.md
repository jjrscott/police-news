Police are investigating a serious assault which occurred in Knaresborough on the night of Saturday 31 March 2018.

The incident is believed to have occurred in the ginnel leading to Park Place, between the High Street and Park Row, at about 11.45pm.

A man in his mid-thirties was seriously assaulted, and was only able to report the assault yesterday due to being in hospital since the night of the assault having facial reconstructive surgery.

Three men were believed to be in the area at the time of the assault, and it may be that they - or somebody else - may have information that could assist the police investigation.

To jog people's memory, the assault took place after the Anthony Joshua boxing match.
