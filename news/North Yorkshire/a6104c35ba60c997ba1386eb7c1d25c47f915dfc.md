North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about the discovery of a dead female Peregrine Falcon found at Hebden Ghyll Near Hebden in The District of Craven.

On the 5 October 2016, a member of public reported finding a dead Peregrine Falcon at the side of a footpath at Hebden Ghyll. PC Simon Crossley Wildlife Crime Officer for The District of Craven attended and recovered a Female Peregrine Falcon with apparent gunshot wounds to one of its wings. The bird appeared in very good condition despite its injuries.

The bird has been examined by a local Vet and X-rays have confirmed the presence of shotgun pellets which have caused major trauma. These injuries would have caused the death of the bird.

Peregrine Falcons are protected under Sec1 of The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.

North Yorkshire Police is appealing for information which would assist in identifying the person(s) responsible for the killing of the Falcon.
