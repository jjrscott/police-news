Following the fatal road traffic collision that occurred on the A682 at Nappa, between Gisburn & Long Preston at 7pm on Tuesday 21 June 2016, police are now in a position to name the motorcyclist who died.

He was Peter Johnston aged 44 years, an engineer from the Manchester area.

Mr Johnston was the second of two motorcyclists travelling towards Long Preston when he came off the road to the left hand side, colliding with a crash barrier and trees, near to Hayber Farm.

Police would like to speak to three potential witnesses, two men and a woman, who were the occupants of a small red car that was travelling along the road about the time of this collision. It is believed they joined the A682 from Nelson in Lancashire, travelled to Gisburn and then on towards Long Preston still on the A682.

TC Dave Seavers of the Major Collision Investigation Team said “We appeal to witnesses, particularly the two men and woman who were travelling in the red car, to come forward and contact us - you may have vital information that could assist with our investigation.”

Anyone with any information is asked to contact 101, select option 2 and ask for Traffic Constable Laura Cleary or TC Dave Seavers from the Major Collision Investigation Team. Please quote reference 12160109228

Alternatively you can email either Laura.Cleary@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk orDave.Seavers@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
