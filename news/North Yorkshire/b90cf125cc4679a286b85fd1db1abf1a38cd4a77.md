Motorists are being asked to avoid areas of Craven due to heavy flooding.

The A65 is currently closed north and south of Ingleton and between Settle and Long Preston. The flooding is being regularly assessed, however, it is not known when the roads will reopen. The closures are expected to cause considerable traffic disruption in the morning.

A number of minor roads are also blocked in the area and several villages in the north of Craven are difficult to access. People are asked to avoid this area at this time.

A number of vehicles have been recovered from flood waters this evening and motorists are asked not to drive through flood water to avoid becoming stranded.
