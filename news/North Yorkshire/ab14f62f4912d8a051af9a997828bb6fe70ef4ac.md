At 12.50pm on Saturday 23 April 2016 a serious collision occurred on the B6267 at it's junction with Halfpenny House Lane close to Masham.

The collision involved a dark coloured Kia 4×4 vehicle travelling away from Masham towards Nosterfield and a white mountain bike which was travelling from Halfpenny House Lane and joining the B6267.

As a result of the collision the rider of the cycle, a 16-year-old female from the local area, sustained serious injuries and was taken to hospital by air ambulance where she remains in a critical condition.

The driver of the 4×4, a 35-year-old woman from the Leyburn area, suffered minor injuries but did not need hospital treatment. The road was closed for several hours to allow Police to investigate the scene.

Police are appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision, or who saw the dark coloured Kia or the cyclist in the area prior to the collision, to contact Traffic Constable 994 Simon Hudson of the Richmond Road Policing Group by calling 101. Please quote reference 12160070424. Alternatively you can email simon.hudson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk .

Police believe the cyclist may be memorable as she was wearing a distinctive pink top and a rucksack and was riding a white mountain-style bike.
