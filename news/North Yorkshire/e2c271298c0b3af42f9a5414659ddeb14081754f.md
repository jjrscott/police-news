Officers investigating the tragic death of Josh Reeson are issuing a fresh appeal for witnesses.

Josh was taken to York hospital by ambulance in the early hours of Sunday 27 September 2020, where he died later that day after having taken illegal drugs.

We now know more detail about the whereabouts of Josh and his friend prior to the call to the ambulance just before 4am on Sunday 27 September.

Josh and his 14 year old friend left an address on Fulford Road around 3.10-3.15am and from there they walked down Fulford Road towards town, they then double back slightly and went down Broadway West.

The two boys then walked back on to Fulford Road, where they met a 14 year old female friend near to the junction of Maple Grove.

It is at this point, on the junction of Fulfold Road and Maple Grove that Josh became ill. A relative of Joshâ€™s friend called the ambulance and stayed with him until it arrived.

Officers are appealing to anyone who thinks they might have seen the teenagers in the area between 3am and 4am, or anyone who was driving in the area at the time and may have dashcam footage, is asked to contact North Yorkshire police.

Dial 101, press 2 and ask to speak to CID York. Or email CIDYork@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0888 555 111.

Please quote reference number 12200169915 when passing on any information.
