**Original release: CCTV pictures released of potential witnesses after woman found with injuries in York**

CCTV footage has been released of potential witnesses who could hold "important information‚Äù after a woman was found with serious puncture wounds to her abdomen in York.

The woman was found lying on the ground on George Street near to Lead Mill Lane by a police officer at 4.34am on Saturday 3 March.
