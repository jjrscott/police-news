Police are appealing for witnesses following a fatal road traffic collision on the A59 at Broughton, near Skipton.

Emergency services were called at around 9.40pm on Friday 24 January 2020 following reports of a two vehicle RTC. The collision involved a silver Mercedes Vito van and a white Nissan Juke.

Sadly the two occupants of the Nissan Juke, a man and woman, were pronounced dead at the scene.

A woman from the Mercedes van was taken to hospital with serious injuries. The driver of the van has been arrested and remains in custody.

Police are appealing for any witnesses who may have seen either of the vehicles prior to the collision, or were on the A59 at the time and may have dashcam footage, to contact North Yorkshire Police.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting reference number 12200013851. Alternatively you can email MCIT@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
