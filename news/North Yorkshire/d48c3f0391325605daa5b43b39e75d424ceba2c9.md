Police are appealing for witnesses following a serious collision south of York.

On Monday 16 May at about 5pm, a collision occurred on Wheldrake Lane, near Crockey Hill. It involved a blue MG ZR, which was travelling from Wheldrake towards Crockey Hill when it left the road into a field, before coming to rest upside down.

Both occupants of the car, two men, were taken to Leeds General Infirmary. The passenger was taken by air ambulance, suffering from serious injuries.

The road was closed to allow police to investigate the scene, and re-opened at 10pm.

TC Mark Patterson, of North Yorkshire Police's Roads Policing Group, said: "I want to hear from any witnesses who saw the blue MG ZR as it travelled on Wheldrake Lane between the village and Crockey Hill, or the collision itself."

Anyone who can help is asked to emailmark.patterson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk. Alternatively, phone North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for Mark Patterson.

Please quote reference number 12160085520 when passing information.
