Three people are in custody following the execution of a warrant in York.

Officers searched a property in Grosvenor Terrace, York at around 11.45am today, Friday 15 September 2017.

Three people were arrested at the address and all remain in custody for questioning. A 37 year old woman and a 19 year old man were arrested in connection with permitting the production of a Class A drug, and a 29 year old man was arrested for possession of a Class B drug.

“Drugs ruin lives and as our operation today has shown, will work tirelessly to eradicate them from our communities.
