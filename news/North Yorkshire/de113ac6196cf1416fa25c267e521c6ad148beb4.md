Skipton Police are supporting Time to Change, the mental health anti-stigma programme run by Mind and Rethink Mental Illness, by getting involved in national Time to Talk Day.

Police officers and staff in Skipton will join hundreds of other schools, organisations and members of the public on Time to Talk Day to break the silence that surrounds mental health.

Local officers will join nurses from the North Yorkshire-based Police Treatment Centre, and staff from other agencies such as Search and Rescue volunteers, ambulance, and fire service staff are all invited to attend the town's police station tomorrow (Thursday 5 February) for a cup of tea and an informal chat about mental health issues.

PC Liz Rutter, of Skipton Police, said: "Time to Talk Day offers a great opportunity to show that we are committed to ending the stigma that surrounds mental health. Our activity will show that talking about mental health doesn't need to be difficult and we can all play a part in getting the conversation started."

Sue Baker, Director of Time to Change, said: "So many lives have been blighted by the stigma that surrounds mental health, and lives have been lost because people don't feel they can talk about their mental health problems and are afraid of getting help. We know that talking openly about mental health can make a real difference so we are asking people to do just that and dedicate just five minutes on 5 February."
