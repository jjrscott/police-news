A suspected drug dealer has found his way to custody after the police helicopter helped to track him down.

At about 1.30pm on Tuesday officers were on patrol on the A1 southbound near Boroughbridge when a black BMW 3 series drove past one of the force's patrol cars.

The vehicle has markers attached to it linked to another incident in Humberside.

Officers swiftly caught up with the vehicle and signalled for it stop but, after pulling onto the hard shoulder, the driver jumped out of the vehicle and fled across some fields.

Colleagues from the National Police Air Service (NPAS) were not far behind and helped officers on the ground to track down a male suspect hiding next to a river in possession of the BMWâ€™s keys.

The 27-year-old Sheffield man was arrested and a large amount of cannabis was seized from the car along with the vehicle.

He remains in custody at this time and the investigation continues.

A spokeswoman said: "We hope our response reassures you we will do everything we can to take drugs off our streets and tackle criminality in North Yorkshire."
