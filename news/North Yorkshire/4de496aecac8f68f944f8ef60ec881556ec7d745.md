Police in Malton are appealing for a cyclist and witnesses to come forward after a boy was injured in a collision with a cyclist.

The collision occurred at around 3.50pm on Wednesday 6 November 2019 on Mill Street in Norton, near to the mini roundabout junction with Beverley Road and Howe Road.

An 11-year-old local boy was crossing the road on his way home from school, when he was struck by a pedal cyclist who had come from the direction of Howe Road. The cyclist did stop at the scene and after remaining for a short time and passing on his apologies, continued on his journey.

The child was taken home by a passing couple before being taken to Scarborough Hospital by his parents. He was detained overnight and has subsequently undergone surgery for a fracture to his collar bone.

Police are appealing for the cyclist to contact them, to ensure he did not receive any injuries and to also fulfil the obligation the Police have to obtain and accurately record the details of all people injured as a result of a collision on the road.

Anyone who has any information in relation to the identity of the cyclist is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask to speak to Traffic Constable Daniel Hughes. You can also email Daniel.Hughes@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
