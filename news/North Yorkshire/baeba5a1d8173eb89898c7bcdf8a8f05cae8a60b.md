Police were called to Lead Lane, Ripon, at 3.50pm on Saturday 12 September.

It was reported that a man in a van parked on the road told a 10-year-old boy to get in as he walked past. The boy refused, ran away and informed his mother about the incident, who reported it to police.

The van is described as a white Transit van, with dents and some rust, with three men inside.

A police spokesman said, "We understand that a report of this nature would cause concern in the local area and we have increased patrols locally to provide reassurance to our communities. Incidents of child abduction are thankfully rare and we are continuing the investigation to confirm the circumstances surrounding the incident".

Anyone who witnessed the incident or who has seen a van of this description in the Lead Lane area of Ripon is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police. Dial 101, press option 1 and pass information on to the Force Control Room.

Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.
