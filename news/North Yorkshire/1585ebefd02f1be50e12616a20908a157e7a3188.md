Christopher Waite, 42, of Brander Road, Gipton appeared at York Crown Court on Wednesday 24 February 2016, charged with one count of burglary and one count of theft of a motor vehicle.

Waite, who has a number of previous charges for burglary, pleaded guilty to both offences and received four years' and six months imprisonment.

The offences relate to a burglary at a home on Wayside Walk in Harrogate in November 2015, when Waite smashed his way into the house and stole jewellery belonging to the homeowners. He went on to take car keys and stole their car from off the driveway.

Waite was successfully identified through forensic evidence left at the scene and working alongside West Yorkshire Police, was later located and brought to justice.

Speaking about the sentence Superintendent Mike Walker said: "This is a great result for both the police and the public in North Yorkshire. The sentence gives a clear message out to travelling criminals; if you come to North Yorkshire to commit crime, we will track you down and bring you to justice.'

'Waite is a prolific burglar and the sentence he has been handed reflects the serious nature of his offending. It is hoped that this outcome will provide some comfort to his victims in the knowledge that he is now behind bars for a long period of time.'
