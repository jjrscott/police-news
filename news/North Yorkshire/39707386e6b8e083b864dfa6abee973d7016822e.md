*****************************************************************************

North Yorkshire Police is investigating the unexplained death of a man in his 80s who was a resident at Sowerby House care home in Sowerby, Thirsk.

Police were called to the care home at around 3.20pm on Wednesday 11 February 2015 after the man was found deceased in his room.

Following an early investigation and forensic assessment, it is suspected that the injuries suffered by the deceased are non-accidental.

As a result, a woman in her 50s from Thirsk, who has no known connection to the care home, was arrested late on Wednesday evening on suspicion of murder. She is currently in police custody for questioning.

Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn, said: "We ask that consideration is given to the residents and the families connected to the care home at this time. The home has not been closed, however, there are areas within the home which are still being examined.

"Specially trained police Family Liaison Officers have been deployed to support the deceased's family."
