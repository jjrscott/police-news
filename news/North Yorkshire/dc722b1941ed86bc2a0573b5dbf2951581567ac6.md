Police in Harrogate are appealing for information after three men armed with a baseball bat, a knife and pepper spray, gained entry to a secure block of flats on Kennion Road, Harrogate.

The men tried to force their way into one of the properties, but thankfully the occupants prevented them from gaining access to their flat. Apart from the effects of pepper spray, the occupants were uninjured. The attack happened at around 11pm on the night of Monday 16 March 2015.

The three men are all described as black, approximately 5ft 9-10in tall, of slim build and were wearing dark-coloured clothing including hooded tops.

Police are carrying out extensive enquiries to locate the men and as part of the investigation, are appealing to anyone with any information to come forward.

Officers believe that the attack was targeted and that the wider community were not at risk.

Anyone who can help officers with their enquiries is urged to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101 - select option 2 - and ask for PC 176 Wilson. Alternatively, information can be emailed to Graham.Wilson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you prefer not to give your name, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.
