Police are appealing for information after a primary school in Strensall was burgled.

Between Saturday 31 October and Monday 2 November 2020, unknown offenders entered Robert Wilkinson Primary School. They caused damage inside, including removing ceiling tiles, and breaking or stealing computer equipment.

Previous incidents were reported at the school on Friday 30 October, when offenders entered the school and made a mess, and on Saturday 31 October, when youths were seen on the school roof firing fireworks.

A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: "This mindless vandalism will no doubt cause disruption at a time when schools are working extremely hard to support their pupils. Anyone with information about who is responsible should contact the police."

Anyone with information about the incidents is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, quoting reference 12200192502.
