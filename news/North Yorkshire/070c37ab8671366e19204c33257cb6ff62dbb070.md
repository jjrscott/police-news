North Yorkshire Police are appealing for information regarding an incident where a woman and her dog were approached and bitten by a black Alsatian-type dog in Thornton-Le-Moor, Northallerton.

The incident took place on Wednesday 22 June at around 3.30pm. The woman and her four-year-old son were walking their dog, accompanied by a friend, when a black Alsatian-type dog which was off its lead approached them.

The approaching Alsatian-type dog then attacked the woman’s dog, causing puncture wounds to the dog’s leg. When the woman attempted to separate the dogs, that Alsatian-type dog then bit her hand, causing cuts to her hand.

The male owner of the Alsatian-type dog then approached, removed his dog and walked away from the incident. He is described as being in his 40’s with dark, greying hair and wearing a leather jacket.

Anyone who may have witnessed the incident or anyone who recognises the description of the dog owner and dog, is asked to contact 101, select option 2 and ask to speak to PC Adam Gatenby. Please quote reference number 12160113227. Alternatively you can email Adam.gatenby@northyorkshire.pnn.police
