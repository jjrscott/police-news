Welcome to the latest blog from student special constable, Pinki Bilku

What a training session, you know it's been a good OST session when you wake up the next day and your whole body is aching! Six-and-a-half hours of officer safety training this week and it was full on!! There was so much to learn but I have to say I really did enjoy it. I’m not quite sure just how much I will remember, but we have a couple more sessions coming up so I’m not overly worried.

We did some role play work this week, we paired ourselves up and we were given a brief of a scenario and asked to put what we had learnt from the previous session into practice, not only was this assessed but we had to act this out in front of the rest of the group. Myself and Amanda got straight in and volunteered to go first, we had a quick discussion on what skills we were going to use and who would do what once we started, and although I was nervous it actually turned out to be quite fun!

Once every pair in the group had been assessed we then had a quick 1-2-1 with one of our trainers, which involved, a brief conversation about any concerns we may have had, how we were finding the OST sessions and we were then given some feedback on our role-plays.

We had a couple of breaks throughout the day which were much needed, the day itself was packed with learning new restraints, blocks, strikes, how to protect yourself if you found yourself on the floor, pad work with punches and kicks, how to get out of close range holds, cell extraction and lastly we were shown how to remove a person from a vehicle.

By the end of the day it’s safe to say we were all very tired and I was feeling absolutely shattered, which just reinforces that I really need to improve my fitness!!
