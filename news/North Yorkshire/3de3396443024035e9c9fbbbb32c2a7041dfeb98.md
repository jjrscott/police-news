Police in Craven are looking to build on a successful Rural Watch scheme that runs across North Yorkshire.

Craven Rural Watch will involve volunteers working alongside local Neighbourhood Policing officers and the force's new Rural Taskforce to take part in planned patrols across rural Craven.

Volunteers will be the 'eyes and ears' of the police while they go about their daily business - or participate in dedicated patrols, feeding back any suspicious activities or vehicles to police officers who can attend in real-time.

PC Michael Carr, of the force's Rural Taskforce, said: "If you have been affected by rural crime, poaching or anti-social behaviour in isolated locations, and would like to help make Craven a safer place to live, please contact us to find out more about Craven Rural Watch."

To get in touch, phone 101, select option 2 and ask for PC Michael Carr, or email michael.carr@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk.
