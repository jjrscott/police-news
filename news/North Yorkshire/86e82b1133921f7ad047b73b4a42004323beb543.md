Police have praised the public-spirited actions of two people who assisted officers at the scene of a serious collision in York.

At about 2.15pm on Monday 30 September 2019, a collision occurred on Monks Cross Drive, York, involving two cars, a Toyota Aygo and a Rover 45.

The driver of the Toyota, a woman in her 90s, was taken to hospital with serious injuries. The other driver was shaken, but not injured.

When officers arrived, two men – one a former police officer, the other a door supervisor – had already stopped and taken action to look after the two drivers, ensuring their immediate welfare was taken care of.

PC Bethany Rowley, of North Yorkshire Police, said: “The two members of the public went out of their way to assist us at the scene, and continued to do so throughout the incident. With their assistance, officers were able to close the road effectively and put diversions in place to keep the flow of traffic moving around the area. Their support was invaluable.

“All the emergency services who attended this collision would also like to thank motorists in the area for their patience in allowing us to investigate the incident effectively and ensure that all those involved received the treatment required.”

Following an investigation, no further police action will be taken in connection with the collision.
