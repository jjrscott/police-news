North Yorkshire Police has one of the highest levels of public confidence in the country, according to a new statistics snapshot entitled "2014 by the numbers", which was issued today.

The snapshot brings together a number of key measures for police activity, and reveals some interesting trends.

Public confidence (which is measured by The Crime Survey for England and Wales) remains very high at 81.2 per cent, which puts North Yorkshire Police in first place when compared to its peer group of similar forces and sixth in the country overall.

The number of incidents that have a mental health dimension has increased. However, the number of custody detentions involving people with mental health problems has dropped dramatically to less than a third of what it was in 2013. This is a result of initiatives such as street triage and places of safety, which give officers better alternatives for dealing with people who have mental health issues, instead of putting them in the cells.

More domestic and sexual abuse offences - traditionally areas where victims are reluctant to come forward - are now being reported to the police. A contributing factor may be the Sexual Abuse Referral Centre, which was launched during 2013 and which provides support to victims of rape and sexual assault.
