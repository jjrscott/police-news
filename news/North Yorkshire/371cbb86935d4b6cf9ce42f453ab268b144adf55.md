Police are reminding off-road bikers to use their motorcycles legally and safely in North Yorkshire.

The message comes as officers seized an off-road bike which was being ridden on the roads of Settle.

At about 7am on Sunday 31 May 2020, officers from North Yorkshire Police’s Rural Taskforce noticed an off-road Honda motorcycle being ridden around the town’s roads.

Officers stopped the bike, and reported the rider, a 27-year-old local man, for driving without insurance and otherwise than in accordance with licence conditions.

The bike, a Honda CRF450, was seized for having no insurance.

Officers today warned that, while many people in North Yorkshire ride off-road bikes safely and responsibly, their misuse can be dangerous - and illegal.

If you drive your trial bike, mini-moto, quad bike or similar off-road vehicle on the road it must have the following:

 * Valid MOT certificate if more than three years old
 * Full car licence or a category B1 licence if it was issued before January 1997
 * A minimum of third-party insurance to drive on the road
 * Registered with the DVLA, taxed, with front and rear number plates for a quad bike
