Fake 'police officer' claimed to be following up on unpaid vehicle tax.

North Yorkshire Police is warning local residents to be vigilant after officers received a report of motorists being approached by an individual claiming to be a police officer.

The individual approached motorists in the car park of Morrisons supermarket in Boroughbridge on Friday evening (26 June 2020), claiming their vehicle tax was out of date. He then took personal contact details for them and proceeded to repeatedly call them the next day, informing them they owed several thousand pounds in fines for unpaid vehicle tax and would be arrested if they did not pay immediately.

Police are warning motorists to be vigilant in case they are approached by the same individual or someone else using this tactic. A North Yorkshire Police spokesperson said:

“If you are approached by someone claiming to be a police officer, they should be happy to show you their identification if asked and you can also confirm their identity by asking their name and ‘collar number’ and calling 101 to verify these details.

“The police will never contact you over the phone, text or email to request payment or to ask you to transfer money to them so if anyone claiming to be the police does so, hang up immediately.

“If you are concerned about whether you are up to date with your vehicle tax, you can check it by visiting the DVLA website.”

If you suspect you have been a victim of a scam or you have experienced anything similar, please call 101 and report it to the police.
