Police are hoping to reunite a 'Good Samaritan' who stopped at a road traffic collision in North Yorkshire with his hi-vis jacket.

Officers attended a collision on the evening of Tuesday 20 March, on the B6161 Leathley Lane, near Otley.

A passing member of the public stopped and provided a warm, high-visibility jacket to a shaken-up motorist.

However, he left before officers were able to reunite him with his jacket, which is currently in storage at Harrogate Police Station.

North Yorkshire Police have turned to social media in a bid to find him, sharing a photo of the forgotten jacket on Facebook and Twitter.

If it's yours, please contact North Yorkshire Police on 101 and select option 4.

In a first for UK policing, North Yorkshire Police use social media to reunite items of found property (often handed in by kind-hearted members of the North Yorkshire public) with their rightful owners.

Follow the North Yorkshire Police - Found Property page on Facebook and @NYP_Property on Twitter for updates on items handed in to police stations in North Yorkshire.

Items circulated in the last month include an Apple Watch found in Harrogate, an engraved pendant locket found in York and even an ice hockey helmet found in Skipton.
