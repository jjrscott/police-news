Police investigating the theft of a purse in a Skipton supermarket have released CCTV footage of a man to whom they would like to speak.

At 9.50am on 9 November 2016, a man entered Morrisons in Skipton. He approached an elderly victim and distracted her by asking questions about an item of food. While doing this, he stole the victimâ€™s purse from her handbag, then left the store. The purse contained a quantity of cash.

Despite extensive enquiries in the following months, including forensic tests and a previous witness appeal, the suspect has not been identified.

However, the investigation is ongoing, and officers have now secured CCTV footage of a man who may have important information that could assist the investigation.

If you recognise him, please contact North Yorkshire Police. Dial 101, select option 2 and ask for PC David Gasson or Skipton Police, or email david.gasson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Please quote reference number 12160203289 when providing information.
