We asked PC Antony Kent why he decided to transfer to North Yorkshire Police and this is what he had to say.

**When did you join NYP and what area do you work in?**

_“I work in response at Richmondshire, joining in July 2016.”_

**What attracted you to a career with NYP?**

_“It was the rural policing, small towns, opportunity to bring experience from previous forces.”_

**Which force were you with before joining?**

_“I was with Durham Constabulary, and prior to them with Northumbria Police.”_

**Is there anything that surprises you about working here?**

_“I see a lot of officers remaining in uniform for over 10 years, not often you see that, great dedication to roles. ”_

**What are the best things about your job/working for NYP?**

_“Every day, assisting colleagues who maybe don’t have the same experience as me and being able to help with their development and understanding..”_

**How would you describe your job in three words?**

_“Fun, intense, development.”_

**What would you say to another officer thinking of transferring to NYP?**

_“Do it, the job is what you make of it, good opportunities to develop, to learn and beautiful area.”_
