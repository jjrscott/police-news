Police in Northallerton are appealing for witnesses, information and dash-cam footage after a female jogger was sexually assaulted by an unknown man.

The incident happened on Brompton Road at 5.15pm on Tuesday 5 January 2021 as the woman, who is aged in her mid-40s, was heading in the direction of Brompton.

The suspect ran off down Byland Avenue.

He is described as around 5ft 10in tall, slim build, and he was wearing a dark hooded top with the hood up, dark straight-leg trousers and a dark rucksack over his left shoulder.

Detailed neighbourhood enquiries, including a trawl of CCTV in the area, have so far not been able to identify the man.

We are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident.
