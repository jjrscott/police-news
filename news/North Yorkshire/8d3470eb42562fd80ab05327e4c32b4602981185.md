North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a sexual assault that occurred in York.

The assault occurred on The Mount, York between 0130hrs and 0200hrs on Sunday 24th May 2015. The female victim was walking back to her hotel when she was approached by a male wearing a grey jacket and jeans. There was also a second male present in dark clothing that was not involved in the assault. An attempt was made to manoeuvre the female away from the road while the male pulled at her dress.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the public's assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about the identity of the males involved and witnesses who can provide an account of what happened.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for 1826. You can also email Rebecca.Lund1826@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
