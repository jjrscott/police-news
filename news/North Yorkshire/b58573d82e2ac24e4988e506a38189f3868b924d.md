The man that officers wanted to speak to in connection with theft of food from a shop in Richmond has been identified.

Original release: CCTV appeal following theft of food from Richmond shop

Police investigating the theft of food items from a Richmond super supermarket have released CCTV footage of a man to whom they would like to speak.

At approx. 5.30pm on Wednesday 11 April 2018 a man entered Heron Foods store with a bag, he selected two items of frozen food (pizza & sausages) and placed them into his bag.

The store manager witnessed this on CCTV and entered the shop floor to challenge the man who quickly ran from the store without paying for the goods.

Officers have now secured CCTV footage of a man that they would like to speak to who may have important information that could assist the investigation.
