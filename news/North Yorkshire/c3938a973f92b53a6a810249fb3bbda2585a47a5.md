Police have published a CCTV still of a woman they want to speak to about the theft of a hard drive.

On Friday 24 February 2017 at about 5pm a woman entered Maplin store on Hurricane Way, York.

She selected a 960GB SanDisk SSD, valued at Â£229.99, and walked out of the store without making any attempt to pay for it.

Despite an investigation, she has not been identified.

Officers would like to speak to a woman pictured on CCTV in the store as she may have important information that could assist the investigation.
