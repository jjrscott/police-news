As police continue the investigation into her death, which is being treated as unexplained at this stage, they are appealing to anyone who knew Rina to come forward.

Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Chief Inspector Nichola Holden, said: “We realise this incident has caused concern among the local community in Helmsley and we thank everyone for their understanding while we carry out what is a very sensitive investigation into Rina’s death.

“To assist with our investigation, I am appealing to local people and anyone in the wider area who knew Rina, not just as a friend, but also by sight, to please contact us, no matter when you last saw her. Your information could be vital in helping us establish the timeline prior to her death.”

Anyone who knew Rina, or knew of her, is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101 and pass information to the Force Control Room, quoting incident number 12180179672.

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

The three people arrested in connection with the discovery of her body have been released on police bail while the investigation continues.
