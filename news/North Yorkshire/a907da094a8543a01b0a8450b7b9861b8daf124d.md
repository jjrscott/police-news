Snow, ice and freezing temperatures can often mean that the elderly and more vulnerable members of our community can't leave their homes.

Just a quick knock at their door to ask if they need any shopping or clearing snow and sprinkling salt on their driveway could help avoid weather related injuries or accidents.

Even just popping in for a chat and a cup of tea can make a real difference on days like today.

Anyone who is worried about an older relative, neighbour or friend can call Age UK advice free of charge on 0800 169 6565, visit their website or contact their local Age UK to see what services are available locally. ageuk.org.uk/get-involved/no-one/
