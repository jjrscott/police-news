Police are appealing for the owners of suspected stolen property to come forward after a haul was recovered in Leeds.

Officers from North and West Yorkshire Police stopped a vehicle on the outskirts of Leeds at around 5.30pm on Monday 28 December 2015 and recovered a quantity of what is suspected to be stolen property. It includes:

 * Garmin watch
 * Jasper Conran glasses
 * Phillips electric razor
 * remote controls
 * lady's Tissot Silver watch
 * lady's Charm Bracelet with the name MATHA 6/6/15 engraved in a heart
 * 42″ and 64″ flatscreen TVs

It is thought the victims may be away over Christmas, so North Yorkshire Police are appealing to all residents and communities of Harrogate District to check with their neighbours, especially those away on holiday at the moment.

If a residence is found to be burgled, please contact North Yorkshire Police and officers will attend and investigate.

Call 101, select option 2, and ask for DC114 Paul Smith. You can also email paul.smith@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
