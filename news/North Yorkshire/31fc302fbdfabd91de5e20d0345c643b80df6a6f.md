Two men have been charged following the deaths of George Thomas Turner (17) and Mason Pearson (17), in a road traffic collision on 7 March 2018.

It happened on the A61 between Busby Stoop and Carlton Miniott and involved a green Volkswagen Bora and a black Ford Focus

The driver of the Bora, a 23-year-old man from Thirsk, has been charged with two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and five counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.

Both men are due to appear at Northallerton Magistratesâ€™ Court at 1.30pm on Tuesday 18 December 2018.

The driver and passengers of the Ford Focus, a 27-year-old man and a 24-year-old woman from outside the area were discharged from hospital following treatment. Their three-year-old daughter and a six-month old son were kept in hospital for observation before being discharged.
