North Yorkshire Police is appealing for information after a car was damaged in Harrogate.

North Yorkshire Police is appealing for information after a car was damaged in Harrogate.

At around 3pm on Boxing Day (Wednesday, 26 December) on Wetherby Road after a male pedestrian and the driver of the vehicle were involved in an altercation. The pedestrian then knocked off the wing mirror of the car, which is a small red hatch back.

The area would have been busy as the incident took place just before the Harrogate and Huddersfield football match and although officers do not believe the incident is linked to the football, they do believe someone will be able to identify the man.

The offender is described as a white man, aged between 40 and 50-years-old, between 5ft 8ins and 5ft 10ins tall and of stocky build. He has short cropped dark hair.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation is urged to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for 1543 Sellars. You can also email alexander.sellars@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to provide information anonymously then the independent charity Crimestoppers can be contacted on 0800 555 111.

Please quote reference 12180239517 when providing information.
