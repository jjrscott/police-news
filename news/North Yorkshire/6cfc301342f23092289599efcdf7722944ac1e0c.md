Police are appealing for information from the public to help identify the man in the CCTV images, after a store manager was assaulted in Scarborough.

Officers want to speak to the man in connection with the incident, which happened on Friday 18 August 2017 at the One Stop Shop in Newborough.

Between 12.30pm and 12.45pm, a man entered the store and was seen to place sausages, cheese and cider into a black bag and head towards the single entry / exit door of the store. The store manager attempted to stop the man leaving the store, when he became aggressive and punched the male store owner in the mouth, causing a cut to his upper lip.

Anyone who recognises the man in the image or who has any information, is asked to contact police. Dial 101, press 2 and ask to speak to PC Gallagher-Barrass.

Alternatively, Crimestoppers be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.
