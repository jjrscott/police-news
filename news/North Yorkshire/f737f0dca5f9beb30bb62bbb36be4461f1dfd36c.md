Drivers who speed in North Yorkshire communities are being targeted in a special operation.

There is a high-visibility presence of mobile safety cameras and roads policing officers in residential areas throughout the county this week.

Volunteers from Community Speed Watch groups across North Yorkshire are also out in force to support the initiative.

It’s part of Operation Vis – a two-week campaign to cut excessive speed on routes that see the most serious collisions and in communities.

Jamie Smith, Community Speed Watch Co-ordinator at North Yorkshire Police, said: “People often tell us they are fed up of drivers speeding through their communities.

“Targeted campaigns such as Op Vis - which use Community Speed Watch groups, safety cameras and other tactics - are an excellent way to make motorists change their behaviour. They also reassure residents that we share their concerns and want to work with them to reduce speeds.

“In the past, our mobile safety camera operators have recorded excessive speeds outside schools, parks, playgrounds and other community areas, including 74mph in a 30mph outside a school in Kettlewell near Skipton.

“The chance of a child surviving a collision at that speed are virtually nil. That’s why we use safety cameras, Community Speed Watch groups and other activities that make our communities safer for everyone.”

Community Speed Watch groups taking part in the initiative include:

 * Weaverthorpe (Ryedale)
 * Eggborough (Selby)
 * Briggswath (Scarborough)
 * Cononley (Craven)
 * Embsay (Craven)
 * Huby (York)
 * Ferrensby (Harrogate)
 * Osgodby (Scarborough)
 * Bishopthorpe Road (York)
 * Askham Bryan (York)
 * Hovingham (Ryedale)
 * Seamer (Hambleton)
 * Carleton (Craven)
 * East Ayton (Scarborough)
 * Gilling West (Richmond)
 * Kelfield (Selby)
 * Scagglethorpe (Ryedale)
 * Fulford (York)

Last week, roads policing officers and safety camera vans were out in force on the A64, A65 and A1(M) in a bit to target the roads that see the highest number of serious collisions.

Surrounding routes, including residential areas and B-roads, were also covered.

North Yorkshire’s initiative is part of a nationwide speed reduction campaign by the National Police Chief’s Council (NPCC).

North Yorkshire Police launched its first safety camera van in 2011 and their use is cost-neutral, meaning the revenue they generate is about the same as the running costs.

The force recently published a Mobile Safety Camera Mythbuster, dispelling some of the myths around the use of cameras and explaining why and how they are used.
