North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a burglary that occurred in Harrogate.

It happened at the Spiritual Healing Church, Princes Square at between 9.25pm on Sunday 4 February 2018 and 6pm on Monday 5 February 2018 when the offender, or offenders, gained entry by forcing a window out of its frame and breaking into a storage cupboard on the ground floor.

Despite gaining access to cash in the cupboard, none was taken, and it's likely the offender or offenders were disturbed and left the same way they entered.

We are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about any suspicious activity in the vicinity of the church, in particular any sightings of anyone entering or leaving via a window.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Adam Smith. You can also email adam.smith@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
