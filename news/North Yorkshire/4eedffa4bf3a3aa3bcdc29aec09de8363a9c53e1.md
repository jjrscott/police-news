A man who stole a wallet and used a supermarket loyalty card inside to spend nearly 100,000 reward points has been sentenced.

David Samuel Arthur Osbourne, 34, of Victoria Road, Scarborough, admitted theft and fraud, and was sentenced to a 12-month community order at York Crown Court.

On 14 April 2017, a man lost his wallet while shopping in Scarborough. He reported the loss to the police.

Later the same day a Nectar card from the wallet was used in Sainsbury’s on Falsgrave Road in two separate transactions, to purchase items worth a total of £482 – using up 96,500 points.

Receipts showed the points were used to buy items including three mobile phones, steak, pet food and chocolates – and the card was left with a balance of less than £20 (3,622 points). The store is covered by CCTV, and a suspect using the card was captured on camera. He was subsequently recognised by officers.

Osbourne was arrested on 26 May 2017, and subsequently charged with theft of the wallet and two counts of fraud by false representation (for using a Nectar card in the name of someone else).

PC Liam Cromack, of Scarborough Police, who led the investigation, said: “The victim and his family had saved up the Nectar points for more than ten years to buy themselves something special, so when Osbourne used them they were understandably very upset. In interview, Osbourne showed no remorse for the offences, saying when he found the card with all the points on he thought it was his lucky day and took advantage of it.”

Osbourne pleaded guilty at Scarborough Magistrates Court on 8 June, and on 29 June at York Crown Court he was sentenced to a 12-month community order with a rehabilitation activity requirement, and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £85.
