Detectives in York are appealing for witnesses and information following a robbery in Rowntree Park on Saturday 18 June 2016.

Between 5.05pm and 5.10pm, a woman in her 40s was walking by herself near the corner of the skate park, on the footpath heading towards the Millennium Bridge, when she was approached from behind by a man riding a cycle.

The man slashed her arm with a knife, causing a 2cm cut. Officers believe he was trying to cut the strap of her purple shoulder bag that was over her right shoulder, but missed.

The attack lasted for a matter of seconds, nothing was said to the victim and nothing was stolen. The suspect did not stop and rode off on his bike towards the Millennium Bridge.

The park was very busy at the time of the incident and officers are appealing to anyone who was in Rowntree Park between 4.45pm and 5.20pm on Saturday 18 June to come forward.

The suspect is described as slim with well-groomed, short, dark brown hair and was wearing a black jumper. He was riding a grey or silver mountain bike.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for York Serious Crime Team.

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote reference number 12160107185 when passing on information.
