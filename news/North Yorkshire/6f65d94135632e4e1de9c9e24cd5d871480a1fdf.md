Police have published CCTV stills of two men they want to speak to about the theft of two leather jackets.

On Saturday 1 July 2017 at about 2pm two men entered the Robert Smart Menswear store on Low Petergate, York.

It is believed that they worked together to distract the shop assistant before leaving the store with the leather jackets, worth Â£2098, without making any attempt to pay for them.

The middle-aged men are described as being well-dressed and were both wearing brown tweed jackets and blue jeans. They are both described as having dark hair and one being stockier than the other. One was also wearing a yellow scarf.

Officers would like to speak to the men pictured on CCTV in the store as they may have important information that could assist the investigation.
