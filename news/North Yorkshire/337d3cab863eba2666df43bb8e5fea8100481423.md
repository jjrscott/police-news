Police have issued a CCTV still of two men they want to speak to in connection with the theft of a bike in York.

At about 12.05pm on Sunday 21 May 2017, two men arrived at an address on Eldon Street in the city, both on bikes. One walked over to another bike, cut the lock on it, took the victim's bike and left the bike behind on which he had arrived.

The stolen bike was a Cannondale Bad Boy 4 mountain bike in black, with racer wheels.

Officers would like to speak to the two men pictured on the CCTV, as they may have important information that could assist the investigation.

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Please quote reference number 12170087396 when passing information.
