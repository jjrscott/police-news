Police have issued a CCTV image of a man to whom they would like to speak in connection with an assault in York.

The incident occurred on Lendal Bridge near to the junction with Rougier Street at 5.20pm on Tuesday 13 June 2017, and involved two men, a cyclist and a pedestrian.

After a verbal altercation, the cyclist dismounted, walked towards the pedestrian and assaulted him. The pedestrian sustained facial injuries, which were treated at York Hospital.

Police have previously appealed for witnesses to this incident, and have now released a CCTV still of a man who might have important information that could assist the investigation.

Anyone who recognises him should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Ffion Twomlow. You can also email ffion.twomlow001941@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12170103306.
