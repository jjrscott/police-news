A teenager has been arrested on suspicion of damaging two Scarborough police vehicles - as he left court.

Just after midday today, staff at Scarborough Justice Centre reported someone damaging a marked police vehicle on Northway outside the court. The suspect had just left the court building, having been there on an unrelated matter.

Officers attended and arrested a 17-year-old on suspicion of criminal damage. An Iveco police van and a Peugeot Partner van, used by crime scene investigators, were both damaged, with their passenger-side wing mirrors knocked off. Both vehicles will be out of action until they can be repaired.

The teenager remains in custody at this time.
