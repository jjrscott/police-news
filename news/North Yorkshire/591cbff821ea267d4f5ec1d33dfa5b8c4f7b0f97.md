North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a theft that occurred in Brompton on Swale, Richmond.

It happened on Station Road, Brompton on Swale between midnight and 4.30am on the morning of 6 April 2017. A White Mitsubishi L200 was stripped of its Bonnet, front door and numerous items from its interior. Offenders have smashed the window before heading off in an unknown direction along Station Road.

Due to the A1 being closed at this time, traffic was being diverted through Brompton on Swale therefore it is likely a passing motorist may have seen offenders in the act and assumed they had permission to remove items from the vehicle. The Mitsubishi was parked at the edge of the owners drive way on Station road at the time of the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information from any motorists passing through Brompton on Swale at this time, particularly if you seen anyone acting suspiciously or any suspicious vehicles in the area.
