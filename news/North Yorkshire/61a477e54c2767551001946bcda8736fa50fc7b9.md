The owner of a JCB mini excavator and Ifor Williams trailer which are believed to have been stolen has come forward.

The excavator and trailer were recovered after police stopped a vehicle that was towing them at around half past midnight on Wednesday 23 March 2016, on the A63 at Monk Fryston.

Following a press and social media appeal, the rightful owner came forward to claim them. Officers are grateful to everyone who shared the appeal for their help in locating the owner so quickly.

A 34-year-old man from the Castleford area who was arrested in connection with the incident has been released on bail pending further enquiries.

Anybody with any information that could assist the investigation is asked to contact police. Dial 101, press option 2 and ask to speak to PC Jill Rawson at the York Investigation Hub.

Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.
