As part of its commitment to raise awareness of hate crime in all of our communities, North Yorkshire Police have released a British Sign Language video about hate crime, to support our deaf community in recognising and reporting the crime

Working with a local BSL translator, the video runs through what hate crime is, how to recognise and report it to police. It also provides details of other organisations and charities who can provide advice and support. The video also explains that North Yorkshire Police will not tolerate any form of hate crime – for example; physical or verbal assault or damage to property - and that reports can be made through a text phone service.

Speaking about the video Sergeant Amanda Hanusch-Moore, hate crime operational lead for the force said:

“Sadly, some members of our deaf and disabled communities have found themselves as targets for hate crime. Rather than support and assist people with a hearing difficulty, some choose to try and exploit their vulnerability for their own gain – something that North Yorkshire Police will not tolerate.

“We hope the video supports the deaf community and helps them to recognise hate crime and also provides reassurance that we take all reports incredibly seriously and action will be taken against it.”

The video is the latest addition to the North Yorkshire Police hate crime web page, which already offers hate crime information in ten different languages including Nepalese, Punjabi, Romanian and Easy-Read.

The video is available to view below
