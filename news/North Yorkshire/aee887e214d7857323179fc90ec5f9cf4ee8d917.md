North Yorkshire Police is appealing for information about items stolen during a residential burglary in Scarborough. Two distinctive items of jewellery were taken.

One was an 18-carat white gold diamond cluster ring containing Asscher and Baguette cut diamonds, which also has 20 round brilliant-cut diamonds on it.

The other was a distinctive Raymond Weil watch, with a black face/ dial with diamonds on it. Both are pictured below.

The break-in happened in the Northway/ Victoria Road area some time before 1pm on Sunday (25 June).

DC David Adams, who is investigating the thefts, said: "Burglary is an abhorrent crime and this particular incident has been very distressing for the victims in this case as these items hold great personal and sentimental value for them. We need your help to find and locate these items and return them to their rightful owners.

"I'd appeal to anyone who has any information about these stolen items to come forward and assist the police with this investigation."

If you have seen or been offered for sale either of these items, or have any information, please call North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for Scarborough Investigation Hub. You can also email David.Adams@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
