Local community groups are in for a cash boost, as North Yorkshire Police invites applications to its Police Property Fund.

Every so often, the police service auctions off property that has been seized as a result of criminal investigations, or that has been recovered from burglaries where no owner has come forward to claim the property back. The proceeds of the auction are used to support local voluntary and charitable projects.

Recent recipients of the Fund include Swaledale Seedlings Playgroup, Art Therapy Yorkshire, Riding for the Disabled in York, Ryedale Community Transport and Richmond Tri-Kudo Triathlon Club.

North Yorkshire Police has now declared the latest round of applications open, and is urging local groups to come forward with their bids by 10 April.

The applications will be judged by Chief Constable Dave Jones, and Julia Mulligan, the Police and Crime Commissioner for North Yorkshire.

Speaking about the fund, Chief Constable Dave Jones said:

"Through the Police Property Fund we are turning the negative results of crime into a big positive for the community, and that is very satisfying. We're very interested in initiatives that could have a positive impact on local safety, but we also want to hear from groups that are creating opportunities for young people, or that help to bring communities together."

Julia Mulligan, the Police and Crime Commissioner, said:

"Local communities are often best placed to know what support they need, and I want to empower those people to make positive changes where they live or work. This fund gives residents an easy way to apply for money which can ultimately make a community feel much safer."

Groups who want to apply for funding must meet certain criteria, and should apply on the North Yorkshire Police application form. This is available at: http://www.northyorkshire.police.uk/ppfa

The deadline for applications is 10 April.
