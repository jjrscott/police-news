On Tuesday 19th January, 150 Y5 pupils from the ten North Craven Primary schools and Giggleswick Junior School gathered at Settle College for a morning of workshops around the P.S.H.E. (Personal, Social, Health Education) theme 'Keeping Safe'.

On Tuesday 19th January, 150 Y5 pupils from the ten North Craven Primary schools and Giggleswick Junior School gathered at Settle College for a morning of workshops around the P.S.H.E. (Personal, Social, Health Education) theme 'Keeping Safe'.

The event was supported by some Y11 students from Settle College and was jointly co-ordinated by PC Dave Ridler (North Yorkshire Police), Felicity Mundell (PSHE lead teacher) and Anne Michelmore-Brown (Headteacher at Giggleswick Primary School), who involved expertise from across the region, including the Children's Society and the NorthYorkshire County Council Children and Family Service.

The morning programme was ambitious, as it involved four workshops which was attended by all pupils on a rota basis covering topics such as drugs, E-safety, different risk-taking scenarios and abuse.

The morning was a great success and comments from participants referred positively to the excellent, thought-provoking material, interactive activities and the sensitively-handled delivery of some challenging subjects.

The event was a fantastic way of getting children involved and mixing with others and it is hoped this will become an annual event in North Craven schools.
