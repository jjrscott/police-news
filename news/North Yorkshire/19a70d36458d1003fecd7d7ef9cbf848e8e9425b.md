Police have lifted the cordon that was put in place around properties at Cockret Court in Selby in the early hours of Saturday 15 July 2017.

In a multi-agency investigation, the suspected hazardous materials found at a property were later deemed to be safe and residents have been allowed to return to their homes.

The 60-year-old man arrested on suspicion of racial/religious aggravated harassment and criminal damage, remains in police custody.

The investigation is ongoing and a scene guard remains in place.

**Original release issued 3.08am Saturday 15 July 2017**

**Police currently attending scene of suspected hazardous material in Selby**

Following the arrest of a 60-year-old man at 2.55pm Friday 14 July 2017 on suspicion of racial/religious aggravated harassment and criminal damage, police carried out a search of a property at Cockret Court, Cockret Road in Selby.

Whilst conducting the search, suspected hazardous material was located at the property and so police and other emergency services have taken the precautionary decision to evacuate the neighbouring flats within a 100m cordon.

Local residents are being supported and temporary shelter is being provided nearby.

The area is cordoned off and there will be disruption to the surrounding area as emergency services attend the scene.

The 60-year-old man currently remains in police custody.
