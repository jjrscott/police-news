Police are appealing for information after a burglary in Richmond.

A large quantity of cash was taken when the Bishops Blaize, in Market Place, was broken into at around 3.30am on Sunday 31 May 2015.

A 45-year-old local man has been arrested and released on bail in connection with the offence.

Despite the arrest, officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward. In particular, they would like to speak to people who saw anyone acting suspiciously in Market Place around the time the burglary occurred.

The police are also urging people to get in touch if they have found any discarded items in their rubbish or recycling that may be related to the incident.

Anyone who can help officers with their enquiries is urged to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101 - select option 2 - and ask for PC Nicola Pattinson or Northallerton Investigation Hub.

Alternatively, information can be emailed tonicola.pattinson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you prefer not to give your name, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Please quote reference number 12150090164 when passing information about this incident.
