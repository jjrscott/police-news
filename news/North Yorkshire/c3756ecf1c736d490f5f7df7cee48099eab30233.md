North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information after several cars were damaged on Percy's Lane, York.

Between 18:15 hours and 22:15 hours on Friday 26 June 2015, the wing mirrors of two vehicles were damaged.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the public's assistance to help determine the identity of a man seen damaging one of the vehicles.

He is described as white, aged in his twenties, of medium build. At the time of the incident he was wearing a dark / burgundy coloured T-shirt, blue jeans and white trainers.

A cyclist not involved in the damage, was seen travelling in the direction of Walmgate at the time and may hold vital information about the identity of the suspect. If you were this cyclist please get in touch with the police as you may be able to assist the investigation.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for Patrick Crehan. You can also email Patrick.Crehan@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
