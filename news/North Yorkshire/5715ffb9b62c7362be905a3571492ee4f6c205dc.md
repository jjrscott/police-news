A verbal and physical altercation has occurred between one man from the group and one of the boys on a bike, which resulted in the boy being pushed off his bike. The man then went on to take the boy's bike and ride off in the direction of Rawcliffe.

His hair was descried as shaven short on the sides and left longer on the top and he was wearing a silver watch and carrying a Nike branded 'man bag.'

The boy's bike (pictured) is described as a black Giant mountain bike, with a dropped seat and distinctive red pedals and orange stickers. Officers would like to hear from anyone who may have been offered the bike, or who may of seen it in the area.
