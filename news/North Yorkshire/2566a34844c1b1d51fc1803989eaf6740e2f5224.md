Police in Skipton are appealing for witnesses and information about the theft of a moped.

It happened at the rear of Keelham Farm Shop, Gargrave Road, at around 1.50pm on Tuesday 3 April 2018.

This involved a white and red moped which was stolen by two men before they wheeled it through Aireville Park and then dumped it in the canal close to the rear of Herriots Hotel.

In particular, we are appealing for any witnesses who may have seen two men walking in the vicinity pushing the moped.

Both were wearing gilets (body warmers) and tracksuit bottoms. One man was wearing a black motorcycle helmet and the other a dark baseball cap. The man with the baseball cap had a large white stripe running down the sleeves of his top.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Martin Carson. You can also email Martin.Carson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk.
