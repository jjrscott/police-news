Six people are in custody after an attempt to steal trolley-fulls of goods from an Acomb supermarket was foiled.

At 5.15pm on Thursday 5 November 2020, a group of people filled four trolleys full of goods and left the store, making no attempt to pay for them.

Staff contacted North Yorkshire Police on 999, and an employee challenged the group as they were loading goods into their car – but they made off, leaving some of the items behind.

Officers immediately began a search of the area, and – acting on information received – made towards the A64 and then the A659 near Tadcaster.

At 7.30pm a Hyundai Santa Fe car was stopped by police. Its occupants, three men and three women, all in their 20s, were arrested on suspicion of theft. A search of the vehicle revealed it had false number plates, and contained items of food and boxed toys.

The six remain in custody at this time while enquiries continue.
