North Yorkshire Police's Chief Constable, Dave Jones, praised the mix of talent and experience that would be joining North Yorkshire Police this week, as he welcomed 10 new Police Community Support Officers to the front line during a passing out ceremony held at police headquarters in Newby Wiske.

The PCSOs will join North Yorkshire Police's Safer Neighbourhood Policing Teams across the county, where they will work with residents and businesses to tackle some of the day-to-day issues that arise in communities.

The officers have just completed an extensive training course to prepare them for their new careers. As well as learning legislation and safety techniques, they were also involved in community placements, where they learned to consider issues from the point of view of local people, including those with different cultural backgrounds and life experiences.

The PCSOs join the service at a time when new powers are being introduced to help the police deal with anti-social behaviour, which will form part of their duties.
