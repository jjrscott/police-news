North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a bogus electrician that visited a property in Harrogate.

It happened on Morel Grove, Harrogate between 6pm and 7pm on Wednesday 19 April 2017 and involved a man attending a property and showing identification suggesting he was an electrician. The man was allowed into the property and looked in every room in the house.

Enquiries have been made with the electricity company and no employees attended the area on that day.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about anyone in the Morel Grove area who had a unexpected visit from an electrician on or around the 19 April to come forward and make contact.

The man is described as being white, late 40s early 50s, with a shaven head. The man may be linked to a Green Rover hatchback car.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for Quita Passmore. You can also email quita.passmore@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
