North Yorkshire Police is appealing for any information in relation to the removal of barn owls from the wild. On or around 3 July thieves had entered the field and used ladders to get the box down from the tree. Two of the nearly fledged chicks were killed and an adult and chick were removed from the box and taken away.

A male and female adult bird were nesting in a man-made barn owl box that had been placed in an oak tree between Sheriff Hutton and Bulmer. The pair had successfully reared chicks in the location for the last seven years.

The barn owls were being closely watched by locals and were working hard to get their chicks to be ready for fledging.

The incident was reported to the police on 5 July 2017.

Barn owls can be bred legally in captivity but it is an offence to take birds from the wild. It would appear that these birds have been stolen to order.

Police are appealing for any information in relation to either adult barn owls or chicks - have you been offered one for sale in suspicious circumstances or do you know anyone who has bought a barn owl in the last week or so.

All barn owls in captivity will have important paperwork and should have a ring on their leg

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for PC 931 Jez Walmsley. You can also email Jeremy.Walmsley@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 121701194334.
