Police have issued a warning to drug users following the circulation of a batch of red tablets - sold as ecstasy -featuring a Superman "S" logo and linked to the recent deaths of four people in Suffolk and Shropshire.

While the drugs are being sold as ecstasy, they contain large quantities of PMMA which is a particularly harmful and dangerous ingredient.

Provisional tests from the Suffolk investigation indicate the tablets that led to the recent deaths contained PMMA. This is more likely than usual to cause harm or even death to anyone taking the drug.

While there is no specific intelligence to suggest the drugs are being sold in North Yorkshire, police forces across the country are advising drug users of the dangers associated with this particular batch of drugs.

Users of any drug can never be really sure of the contents of anything they take but with ecstasy, which is a class A drug meaning it's illegal to possess and supply, the potential health issues are very real and potentially fatal.

Anyone with information about drugs, and in particular any batch with a superman logo on it, are asked to contact Crimestoppers anonymously and in confidence, on 0800 555 111 or by calling their local police on 101.
