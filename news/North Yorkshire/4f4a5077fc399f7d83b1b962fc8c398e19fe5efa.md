Police are appealing for a public-spirited motorist who flagged down a police officer to report suspicious activity to get in touch with them.

At about 6.35pm on Wednesday 10 June 2015, a motorist, believed to be driving a silver Audi car, flashed his lights at a passing police patrol to report a man trying to sell drills out of a bag on Gladstone Lane in Scarborough.

A 24-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of theft in connection with the incident, and two Bosch drills and a Bosch battery were recovered. He has been released on bail pending further enquiries.

PC Mark Barnard, of Scarborough Police, said: "I am hoping to trace the member of the public who flagged down the officer, as his details were not taken at the time, and he may have important information that could assist the investigation. I would also like to trace anyone who might have been offered the drills for sale, or indeed anyone who might have had drills stolen but has not yet reported it."

Please dial 101 and ask for Scarborough Investigation Hub, quoting reference number 12150096886.

If you prefer not to give your name, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.
