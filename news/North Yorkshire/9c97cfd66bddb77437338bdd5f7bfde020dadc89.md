Police are appealing for witnesses after a man was bitten by a dog in York.

At about 8.15pm on Monday 21 March 2016, a man was bitten by a dark brown Staffordshire bull terrier type dog, causing a large puncture wound to his leg which required medical treatment.

The incident took place in Lawrence Street, near Walmgate Bar.

The dog was on a lead and its owner, who was present at the time of the incident, is described as a white woman, around 5ft 10ins tall, of slim build, aged between 35-45 years old, with shoulder-length dark hair with a fringe. She was wearing a purple and blue rain coat with dark-coloured jeans.

Anyone who witnessed the incident, or can identify the owner of the dog, is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police. Dial 101, select option 2 and ask for PC Louise Harness. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Please quote reference number 12160052806.
