North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses in relation to an assault that occurred in Filey.

It happened at the Muston Grange Caravan Park on the afternoon of Sunday 30 June and involved a physical altercation between a male and a female. The victim, a 29-year old female from Leeds, received a cut lip, swelling and bruising to her face.

A 42-year old male, also from Leeds, was arrested in connection with the assault and has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

We are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident, which is believed to have escalated from a disagreement on Filey beach earlier in the day.

In particular, we are appealing for anybody who may have been staying at the caravan site that afternoon and recalls witnessing the incident that led to police being called.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Liam Cromack. You can also email liam.cromack@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12190117960.
