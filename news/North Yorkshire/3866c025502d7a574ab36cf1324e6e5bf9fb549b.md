Police in Sherburn-in-Elmet are inviting residents to join them and other agencies at a drop-in day in the town.

Lift is a multi-agency event which will see North Yorkshire Police officers join staff from Trading Standards, Horizons drug and alcohol services, IDAS (Independent Domestic Abuse Services) and Citizens Advice Bureau.

PC Neil Himsworth, who is co-ordinating the day, said: "I'd like to invite all Sherburn residents to join us for what promises to be a very positive day. We will have experts on hand offering support and advice, so it's a great opportunity to discuss those 'quality of life' issues that could make a real difference to people in the town."

The event will run from 11am to 3pm in the main car park in the centre of Sherburn-in-Elmet on Saturday 7 February
