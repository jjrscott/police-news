Police are appealing for witnesses following a serious collision earlier this month.

On 3 June 2017 at around 11.20pm, a white Vauxhall Corsa was travelling from Kirkbymoorside towards Pickering when it was in collision with a stationary HGV which was parked in a layby near Keldholme.

The driver and only occupant of the Corsa, a 19-year-old local man, was taken to Scarborough Hospital with serious injuries.

The road was closed for three hours for collision investigation.

Officers want to speak to anyone who saw the collision itself or the white Vauxhall Corsa as it travelled from the town centre of Kirkbymoorside onto the A170 and east towards Pickering.

Please dial 101, select option 2 and ask for TC Mark Patterson, or email mark.patterson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk. Quote reference 12170096879 when passing information.
