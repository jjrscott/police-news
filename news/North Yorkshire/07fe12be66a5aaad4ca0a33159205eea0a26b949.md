Just to confirm that the police incident has concluded at Joseph Rowntree School in York and school has returned to normal daily business.

To reassure parents following a number of rumours on social media, there was no-one with a gun or any other weapon and no-one has been injured.

At around 9.30am today (13 March 2019) the police took a teenage boy into custody after they received information that threats had been on social media.

We realise the sight of police officers at the school caused concern. However we hope parents are reassured that we take all such allegations seriously and worked with the school to minimise disruption and ensure the safety of all pupils.

There will be a full investigation into the allegations to determine who was responsible. In the meantime, we ask people not to speculate on social media and allow the investigation to take its course.

Thank you.
