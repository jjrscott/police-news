Police are appealing for witnesses following a serious collision near to Hellifield involving a car and a motorcycle.

It happened at approximately 1.35pm on Tuesday 18 July on the A682 at the junction with the B6253 near to Hellifield.

The collision involved a blue Peugeot 107 which was travelling along the A682 from Guisburn towards Long Preston and a black and silver Honda motorcycle which was travelling in the opposite direction towards Guisburn.

As a result of the collision the rider of the motorcycle, a 45-year old man from the Blackburn area, sustained serious injuries and was taken by air ambulance to Leeds General Infirmary where his condition is currently described as stable.

The female driver of the car involved, who is aged 74, and from the Leicestershire area sustained minor injuries and was taken to Airedale General Hospital. The road was closed until 7.25pm whilst police investigated the scene.

Officers are appealing for any witnesses who may have seen the collision or seen the vehicles in the area at the time of the collision to contact them.

The road was busy due to a diversion from the A59 as a result of an earlier incident and it is believed a number of people travelling in both directions may have witnessed the incident.

Any witnesses are asked to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for Andy Morton. You can also email andrew.morton@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk.

Please quote reference number 12170126417 when passing on any information.
