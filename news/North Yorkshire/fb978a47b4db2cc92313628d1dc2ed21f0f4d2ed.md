Police have renewed their appeal for information about a collision in which a Darlington man died.

The driver, who police have named as 44-year-old Jason Davison, was in a silver Ford Transit panel van on Cleasby Road, between Cleasby and Stapelton, when the vehicle left the carriageway.

The incident took place on Saturday, 23 January 2016 at 11.20am and the van, which was marked with company livery, was heading in the direction of Stapleton.

Sergeant Ian Pope of North Yorkshire Police's Major Collision Investigation team said: "This is another tragic loss of life on the roads.

"We are working hard to fit the information we have so far so that we can establish what exactly has occurred in this case.

"I want to renew our appeal for witnesses to contact us if they witnessed the vehicle being driven on Saturday morning or they saw the collision. Even if you don't think it is important it may help us with the enquiry."

Anyone with any information if asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for the Major Collision Investigation Team, or email _MCIT@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk_

Please quote incident number 121600 13183.
