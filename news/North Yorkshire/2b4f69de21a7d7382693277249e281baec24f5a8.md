It happened at the rear of Sun Street, Cowling, at about 2.10pm on Monday 23 November 2015 and involved three men who were driving a white flat-back vehicle that was loaded with scrap. One of the men entered a back yard and removed two car batteries without permission.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the public's assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about the men and the vehicle, which was a white dropside flat-back pick-up with an orange light on the cab.

2\. white, short dark hair and beard, wearing dark coloured bodywarmer, long sleeve grey top, dark trousers

3\. white, short dark hair with bald patch on top, beard, wearing dark trousers, dark jacket with florescent stripes on and hat with ear flaps

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for Susan Marklew. You can also email susan.marklew@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
