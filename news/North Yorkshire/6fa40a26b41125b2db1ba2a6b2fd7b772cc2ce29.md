North Yorkshire Police is appealing for information following a burglary which led to the theft of a motor vehicle in Knaresborough.

The incident occurred on Appleby Avenue during the early hours of Thursday, 30 August – possibly between 2am and 3am.

We are particularly interested into speaking with anyone who has CCTV in this area. If possible, we would ask anyone with CCTV to review it, starting with the time between 2am and 3am, to see if they have captured any part of the offence on camera – this could be vital evidence.

Anyone with information which could assist with the investigation is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for 1233 Laura Jobling. You can also email laura.jobling@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, information can be passed on through the independent charity Crimestoppers by calling 0800 555 111.
