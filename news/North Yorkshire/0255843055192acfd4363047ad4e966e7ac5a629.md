Our Coroner's office is appealing to anyone who knew 53-year-old Craig Fryer from Harrogate and can help locate his next of kin.

Sadly Craig died at his home in Woodfield Road, Harrogate on 15 March but officers have been unable to trace his next of kin.

It is believed that Craig has two daughters, one believed to live in Australia and one who lives in the south of England. However, it is unknown exactly where.

If you are Craig's daughter or have information that could help find them, please contact our Coroner's office via email to coroner@northyorkshire.police.uk.

There are no suspicious circumstances surrounding Craig's death.
