Thank you to all who shared our appeal, the necklace has now been located by the owner.

Original release: Appeal for information following theft of elderly Barton woman's unique necklace

North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about the theft of a unique pendant style necklace which was taken from an elderly woman's bedroom.

It happened towards late February or early March 2018 at the owner's home address in Barton.

It is believed the necklace has somehow been removed from the address and possibly offered for sale, pawned to raise money, or melted down.

The item is described as a Nefertiti pendant style, silhouette centre with a twisted wire border, an attached trace link chain with a bolt ring fastener. It is approx. 22ct gold, weighs 36.2 grammes and is valued at over £2,000.

The unique item was commissioned specially for the owner 44 years ago while living abroad and is thought to be extremely rare in its design and as such carries significant sentimental value.

We are requesting the public’s assistance to help establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Richard Grey. You can also email richard.grey@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12180065313
