Harry is a 14-week-old cocker spaniel who is destined to become an explosives detection dog.

He likes to wear his green Halloween jumper at the moment but one day heâ€™ll have to swap it for a hi-vis police harness.

He is currently being puppy-walked by one of our volunteers to socialise him and get him use to everyday situations such as getting to know other dogs, travelling in a vehicle, interacting with people, getting used to traffic and other noises.

Next week he will go to live with our Dog Section Sergeant, Simon, where he will start to integrate into police life, get to know his grown-up canine colleagues, and will be continually assessed for his suitability as a police search dog.

Once we know he has the right temperament and attitude to be a search dog, he will be paired up with his human handler and they will train and qualify together as a team.

He'll then begin his career helping to keep North Yorkshire and its communities safe.

Good luck little Harry, we look forward to following your police career.
