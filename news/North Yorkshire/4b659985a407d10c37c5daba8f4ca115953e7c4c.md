Specialist rural crime police officers are appealing for information after lead thieves caused thousands of pounds of damage to a historic building.

Some time between Thursday 29 and Saturday 31 March 2018, offenders climbed scaffolding and removed lead from the roof of the Temple of Victory, in the grounds of Allerton Park, Flaxby (near Knaresborough).

The damage will cost thousands of pounds to repair.

The 18th-century Palladian-style building is Grade II* listed and is currently undergoing renovation. It is visible from the A168 and A1(M).

Officers from North Yorkshire Police's Rural Taskforce are appealing for anyone with information about the theft to contact them: phone North Yorkshire Police on 101, quoting reference number NYP-31032018-0336.

A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: "North Yorkshire has thousands of heritage sites across the county - they're part of the reason why it's such an attractive place to live and visit. Our Rural Taskforce is working with partner agencies and the wider community to protect such sites, so that others can continue to enjoy them for many years to come.

"Repairing the damage caused to heritage assets is expensive, and the cost to communities can often be immeasurable. If you have an interest in heritage, or live near a historical site, please keep an eye out, and report any suspicious activity to us on 101, or 999 if a crime is in progress."
