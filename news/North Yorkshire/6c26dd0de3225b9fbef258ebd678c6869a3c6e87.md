Officers are trying to trace the owners of a number of high-value bikes which were seized during a police investigation in York.

The items – which include road, mountain and hybrid cycles pictured below – were discovered by officers at an address in Gillygate.

They include:

 * A black Specialized Allez
 * A matte-black Norco Threshold
 * A Calibre Bossnut in red
 * A grey/green Felt 85X
 * A black and white Probike Black Knight

Officers also found a Cannondale bike at the address but believe they may have traced the owner.

A man in his 20s from York has been arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods and a range of other offences. He has been remanded to appear before magistrates in York next month.

Anyone who recognises the items pictured should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for Cheryl Power. You can also contact Detective Constable Power by emailing Cheryl.Power@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
