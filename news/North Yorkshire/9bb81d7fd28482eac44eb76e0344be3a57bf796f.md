Today, Julia Mulligan, the Police, Fire & Crime Commissioner for North Yorkshire, has spoken to the media revealing that she was a victim of a serious sexual crime in the past.

Commenting on the matter, Chief Constable Lisa Winward said:

“It takes courage for someone to speak out about an incident of sexual abuse or rape, as Julia has done today. She has our absolute support, on a personal level as a colleague, and at an organisational level as a police service.

“My message today to anyone who has been a victim of a sexual crime, whether it happened recently or in the past, is that the police are here to help. If you come forward and report the incident, we will provide you with support, investigate the crime, and do everything within our power to bring the offender to justice.

“That said, these matters are extremely personal, so our approach is very much a victim-centred one. In this case, the incident has been logged, but the Commissioner has been clear that she does not want to make an official report to the police, and does not want the matter investigated at this time. That is her personal choice, and we respect it completely.

“If you have been victim of a sexual crime and you don’t want to report it to the police, I would still urge you to seek professional support. You do not have to deal with it alone. In North Yorkshire you can contact Supporting Victims on 01609 643100 or www.supportingvictims.org Or you can contact Bridge House, the Sexual Assault Referral Centre, on 0330 223 0362 or www.bridgehousesarc.org . Bridge House provides free confidential support and practical help to anyone in North Yorkshire and York who has experienced sexual violence or abuse.”
