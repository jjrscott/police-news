Police have issued an urgent warning about dangerous and illegal drugs, believed to be LSD, after officers became aware of five young people from the Colburn area seeking hospital treatment since the weekend.

Enquiries are ongoing to identify the source and supply of the drug – which is in the form of small black paper squares with a red flash design – but officers are extremely concerned that others may have taken or are going to take it.

Inspector Mark Gee, of Richmondshire Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: “Our message is clear: these drugs are inherently dangerous, particularly when taken with other substances including alcohol. It is illegal and could have serious consequences. If you or anyone you are with have taken illicit substances and become unwell, please seek appropriate medical attention as soon as possible.

“Illegal drugs often contain different substances, making it impossible to visually identify what they are, or how strong they are. The effects of this hallucinogenic can be strong, unpredictable and overwhelming to the user, as seen with the hospitalisation this week of a number of young people locally.”

Anyone with information about these drugs is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101 quoting reference number 12210064362, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
