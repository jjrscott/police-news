North Yorkshire Police is appealing for information after a spate of burglaries in the Smeaton area over the weekend.

Four burglaries are reported to have taken place during the early hours of Saturday 13 June with offenders gaining entry to two garages and two sheds before leaving with items from inside. They are believed to have occurred between 1am and 3.30am.

The first burglary was reported as taking place on Main Street, Little Smeaton when a homeowner woke up to find that unknown offenders had stolen a Lay-Z Spa Paris hot tub from their garden (pictured) after gaining entry to the garage to unplug it before emptying it of water.

In the second burglary, another garage was entered at a home on Water Lane, Kirk Smeaton and a little girlâ€™s distinctive pink quad bike (pictured) was stolen.

In the third and fourth burglaries, two sheds were also entered at addresses on Hodge Lane and Water Lane, in Kirk Smeaton and two drills were stolen from one of the sheds. Nothing was stolen from the second shed.

Anyone who witnessed suspicious activity in the area or has information, including any CCTV or dash-cam footage, is asked to call 101 quoting the below incident numbers. Alternatively, please email Anthony.Morton@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk and David.Pegg@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

 * Little Smeaton: stolen hot tub incident - 12200099401

 * Hodge Lane, Kirk Smeaton: 2 drills stolen from a shed- 12200099402

Officers would also like to hear from anyone who has seen or is offered any of the items for sale under suspicious circumstances.

Most reported burglaries are found to be opportunistic and we would like to remind residents to check that their properties are secure and to report any suspicious activity or noises by calling 101 or 999 if an incident is in progress.
