During the Christmas period, there has historically been an increase in the number of purse thefts from shoppers in crowded shops and markets.

This year is no exception.

“Already there have been a number of travelling criminals who have been taking advantage of people who are buying Christmas gifts for friends and family,” said Sergeant Andy Graham, who covers Knaresborough and Boroughbridge.

“Please take extra precautions with your property, and do not leave items such as purses, phones or presents unattended on top of your shopping trolley or bag.

“Can I also please ask that, where possible, items of value are secured and any bags are fastened or zipped up.

“Remember, an open bag is an easy target for any opportunist thief. The same goes for items left in open view in cars such as sat navs, wallets, phones and, of course, Christmas presents.

“By removing the temptation, you are greatly reducing your chances of becoming a victim of crime.”

Suspicious activity should be reported to North Yorkshire Police’s Force Control Room via 101, option 1.

For crimes in progress when an emergency response is required, always dial 999.
