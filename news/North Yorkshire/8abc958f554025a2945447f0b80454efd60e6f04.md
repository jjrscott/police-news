North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a collision that occurred on the northbound carriageway of the A1(M) close to Dishforth.

The collision happened at 3.50pm on Wednesday 24 February 2021, and involved black Hyundai i10 and blue Renault Clio colliding, one of which overturned and came to a stop in the live carriageway on its roof.

The road was partly closed by police and highways staff for over an hour whilst emergency services investigated the scene and to allow the vehicles to be recovered.

We are appealing for witnesses to the collision or anyone who recalls seeing either of the vehicles prior to the collision, to get in touch as soon as possible to assist the investigation.
