Two men have been arrested on suspicion of supplying class A drugs, after police spotted a suspicious vehicle near Selby.

Officers stopped a black VW Golf near Rawcliffe Bridge, Goole, at about 11.55pm on Monday 15 May.

The vehicle was searched, and its two occupants arrested. A 37-year-old man from the Leeds area was arrested on suspicion of driving whilst disqualified and possession with intent to supply a Class A drug. A 51-year-old man from South Milford was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a Class A drug and money laundering.

The 37-year-old man has been charged with driving whilst disqualified and without insurance, and will appear in York Magistrates Court next month.

Both men have been released under investigation while enquiries continue in relation to the other suspected offences.
