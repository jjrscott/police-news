A clampdown on people cycling without lights in York has been hailed a success.

Police officers and PCSOs, supported by volunteer Special Constables, took part in an operation at Bootham, Micklegate and Walmgate bars last night, aimed at keeping cyclists and other road users safe.

The vast majority of cyclists seen by officers were correctly and safely using lights. However, 36 Traffic Offence Reports were issued to cyclists who didn't have lights on their bikes

A number of sets of emergency cycle lights and high-visibility rucksack covers were issued to some people who didn't have lights, to enable them to carry on their journey safely - for example, to young people who would otherwise have had to walk a long distance home.

The lights and rucksack covers have been funded by City of York Council - part of a cycle safety campaign that ran for the first time last year.

Inspector Lee Pointon, of York Police, said: "The operation was really well received, with many pedestrians stopping to make positive comments about the proactive campaign.

"We will undertake further operations over the next few weeks, ensuring that we continue to have a direct and positive effect on the safety of people in the city."

Cyclists are urged to visit www.northyorkshire.police.uk/cyclesafety for police videos and advice on cycling safely.
