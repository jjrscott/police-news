Police have thanked members of the community in Eggborough for their support and understanding after an unauthorised encampment was removed from the village.

As a result of an escalation in incidents linked to the encampment, North Yorkshire Police launched an operation to remove it.

Using powers under section 61 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which allows police to remove trespassers from land, the operation resulted in members of the traveller community leaving the site without incident, from 7pm yesterday.

They have left the North Yorkshire area, and partner agencies are now working with the landowner to clean up the site.

Superintendent Lindsey Robson, York & Selby Commander at North Yorkshire Police, said: “I know that the unauthorised encampment has caused really significant issues and concerns for people in the Eggborough community over the last few days, and I’m very thankful for residents’ patience and understanding while we resolved this issue. I am also grateful to Selby District Council for their support.

“Our response had to be a graduated one, working with partner agencies to consider the safeguarding implications for everyone concerned, before we could use the legislation available to us.

“Officers from the local Neighbourhood Policing Team will be in the village over the coming days, providing a visible, reassuring presence, and speaking to residents about any further concerns they have.”
