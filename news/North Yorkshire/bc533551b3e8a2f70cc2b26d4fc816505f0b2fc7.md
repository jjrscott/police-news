A man from Easingwold has been sentenced to 13-years imprisonment following a 12 month investigation into sexual abuse against two girls which occurred in the late 1980s.

In June 2017 North Yorkshire Police launched an investigation following allegations that 81-year-old Donald Cornforth had sexually abused two woman when they were young girls. One of the girls was aged in her early teens and the other was younger at the time the abuse began.

Investigating officer, Detective Constable Nicky Wareham, said: “This is a tremendous result for the victims involved in this case who showed exceptional courage in highlighting the abuse they suffered at the hands of Cornforth.

“Their bravery continued throughout the trial and I have no doubt their courage and resilience assisted with the conviction that followed.

“I hope this is a clear example that will encourage other victims of abuse to come forward and talk to police knowing that abuse of this kind, no matter how historic, will be taken seriously and thoroughly investigated.”
