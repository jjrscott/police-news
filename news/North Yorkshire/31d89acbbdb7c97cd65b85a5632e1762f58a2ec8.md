North Yorkshire Police Lifestyle Challenge award-winning youngsters Team Lifestyle Café have once more set their sights on raising money for the local community.

Having won not only the Safer York Community Award at last year's Police-led event but also a Lord Mayor's SHINE Award earlier this year, these five from York are only just back from their PGL Adventure Holiday prize but they are already in the kitchen again.

Since last year, they have held a pop-up café to raise funds for the York flood victims and are now busy baking, stirring and icing as they prepare for this Saturday's event. Held once more on the Knavesmire, TLC are hoping to raise much needed funds for St Chad's Greys Beavers, Cubs and Scouts to help them repair the boiler and to fix leaky containers which house their tents and camping equipment.

Lellie, Jimmy, Luke, Ethan and Aidan are on their way to becoming talented chefs with visitors to the café being served pizza, soup, sandwiches, savoury platters and lots of cakes and sweet treats. The team will also be taking the orders and waiting on the guests, who will be asked to make a donation to the St Chad's Greys fund in return for their delicious lunch.

The pop-up café will be held on Saturday 30 April at 128 Knavesmire Crescent and will be open from 10.30am to 2.30pm.
