North Yorkshire residents are invited to discover the trends that are shaping policing through a special new exhibition that is touring across the county.

"Policing in North Yorkshire" will take place at the following venues throughout June and early July:

1 and 2 June - Milton Rooms, Malton
3 and 4 June - St Peter's Church, Harrogate
11 and 12 June - Spurriergate Centre, York
15 and 16 June - Hawdon Institute, Selby
23 and 24 June - Town Hall, Skipton
25 and 26 June - The Street, Scarborough
29 and 30 June - Rural Arts Centre, Thirsk
1 July - Richmond Town Hall, Richmond

The exhibition will give an insight into the number and type of incidents the police deal with in a year, the different roles within policing, and how the police are using technology to target criminal activity. It will also outline the way that North Yorkshire police plans to work in the community in the future.

Commenting on the exhibition, Chief Constable Dave Jones said:

"People are hearing a lot in the news about cuts to police budgets, and it is no secret that all police services are facing financial challenges. But here in North Yorkshire we are working hard to find more efficient and effective ways to protect communities, and we want to share that approach with the public. This exhibition is a great way for people to discover what is happening at North Yorkshire Police, so I hope that people will find a few minutes to come along."

The Police and Crime Commissioner for North Yorkshire, Julia Mulligan, said:

"The financial situation means that all public services are having to make some tough decisions - including the police - so it is important that we help everyone to understand the issues. I'm looking forward to meeting people at these events, and sharing the direction of travel for the North Yorkshire Police."

All "Policing in North Yorkshire" events are free to attend. Event details and booking is available at: www.nypolice.eventbrite.co.uk
