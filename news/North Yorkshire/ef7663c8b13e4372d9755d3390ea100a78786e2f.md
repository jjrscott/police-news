Police were called at around 3am today (Saturday 21 October 2017 by site security at Kirby Misperton, to a report that three protestors had gained access to the hydraulic fracturing site.

Two men and a woman climbed onto a platform 60ft up a rig inside the site and have remained there since.

Superintendent Michael Walker, of North Yorkshire Police, said:

“Once again, emergency services resources will have to be deployed to deal with this situation.

“We have endeavoured to work with people on all sides of the issue, and our approach has been to ask them to work with us to make this a safe and peaceful protest.

“However, when it turns from peaceful protest to deliberate acts that are unlawful, cause unreasonable disruption to others or are dangerous then we need to take action.

“Our immediate concern is the safety and welfare of the protesters. Officers are on site assessing the situation.

“If the safety of those on the rig is put at risk then we will take appropriate action to bring the protest to safe conclusion.”
