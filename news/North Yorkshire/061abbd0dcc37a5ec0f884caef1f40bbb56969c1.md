Detectives leading the investigation into a serious sexual assault in Knaresborough on Sunday morning have thanked the public for their response to the appeal for information.

Detective Chief Inspector Allan Harder, of North Yorkshire Police, said: "I am very grateful to the members of the public who have already contacted me with information in relation to this extremely distressing incident.

"However, our enquiries are ongoing, and I am still appealing for people to come forward. I need to speak to anyone who was in the area of King James's School between 9am and 11am on Sunday 5 April. Any information, no matter how slight or apparently insignificant, could be crucial to this investigation."

Officers are carrying out extra patrols in the area to provide reassurance to the local community.

The victim, a teenage girl from Knaresborough, is continuing to receive support from specially trained police officers.

Anyone who can help with this enquiry should contact North Yorkshire Police by dialling 101 - select option 2 and ask for Harrogate CID.

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. No personal details are taken, information cannot be traced or recorded and you will not go to court.

Please quote incident number 12150055295 when passing on any information about this incident.
