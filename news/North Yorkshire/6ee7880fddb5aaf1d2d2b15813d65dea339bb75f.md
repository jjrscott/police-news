Police have released CCTV images of four men they would like to speak to regarding a number of reports of alleged attempted fraud.

On Friday 16 June 2017 at around 4.45pm the men were seen to visit Marks and Spencers in York City Centre, where one of the men made a purchase of a small value item, but offered the till operative a number of £20 notes and requested change be given back in £10 notes. Another attempt was made at another till minutes later by a different member of the group.

The men were then captured on CCTV at around 5.10pm the same day, entering the Marks and Spencers store at Vanguard shopping park, where an alleged similar attempt was made.

At 5.20pm they were then seen entering the ASDA store on Jockey Lane, Monks Cross and again purchasing a small value item with a large number of £20 notes and requesting the change be provided back in smaller denominations.

Police would like to speak to the men, to determine the full circumstances around these incidents and are appealing to anyone who recognises any of them to call 101 and ask to speak to PC Nikki Jackson. You can also email Nikki.Jackson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
