Police are urging residents to take steps to keep their homes secure, after an attempted burglary in Harrogate.

In the early hours of Thursday 12 February, someone tried to gain entry to a house on Hartwith Drive, Jennyfields, Harrogate. The homeowners were alerted up by their dog barking, and discovered that a window had been forced open. Nothing was taken in the incident.

DC Quita Passmore, of Harrogate CID, said: "North Yorkshire and Harrogate in particular are among the safest places in the country. However, I would urge residents to be vigilant and take steps to secure their homes. Follow the crime prevention advice on the North Yorkshire Police website, at www.northyorkshire.police.uk/7001, or contact your local Safer Neighbourhood Team, who will be able to advise you on the latest home security advice and equipment."

Harrogate District Community Safety Partnership has released a YouTube video featuring PC Amanda Hanusch-Moore, of Harrogate Police, with advice for homeowners on how to keep their property secure. You can watch it at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUdHdkQgbRc

North Yorkshire Police have also created an interactive home security self-assessment tool, BurglarProof, which you can use on a smartphone or other mobile device to ensure your property is a safe as possible: http://burglarproof.nyp.mobi/

Anyone who saw any suspicious people or vehicles in the early hours of Thursday morning in the Hartwith Drive area is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for DC Quita Passmore or Harrogate CID. If you prefer not to give your name, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111. Please quote reference number 12150023561 when giving information about this incident.
