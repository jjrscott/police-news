DC Victoria Lawson joined us last year from West Yorkshire Police and here’s what she had to say when we asked her why she decided to transfer here.

**When did you join NYP and what area do you work in?**

_“I transferred to NYP in June 2017 and work in the Serious Crime Team in Harrogate.”_

**What attracted you to a career with NYP?**

_“It was the force area, the work ethos and employee support.”_

**Can you remember your first day/week with us? What was it like?**

_“The first week was spent at the old HQ in Newby Wiske which was a fantastic location. The weather was beautiful and the trainers were very welcoming and friendly. It was very enjoyable and a very positive first week with NYP.”_

**Is there anything that surprises you about working here?**

_“How beautiful the landscape is and how vast the force area is.”_

**What are the best things about your job/working for NYP?**

_“Nice people, a supportive team, time to investigate crimes, time to give victims a high level of service and a beautiful area to work.”_

**How would you describe your job in three words?**

_“Demanding, enjoyable, challenging.”_

**What would you say to another officer thinking of transferring to NYP?**

_“It is the best decision I’ve ever made in my 21 year policing career._
