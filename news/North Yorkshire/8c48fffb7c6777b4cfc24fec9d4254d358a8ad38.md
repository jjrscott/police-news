A man’s body has been recovered from the River Ouse in York following an incident in the early hours of Saturday 20 April 2019.

Officers were alerted by CCTV operators to suspicious activity in the area of King’s Staith at around 1.19am.

Police officers were dispatched to the scene, but on police arrival a man ran off from the officers and entered the River Ouse a short time later.

A search was carried out involving York Rescue Boat and North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service and the man was recovered from the river just after 3am. Ambulance staff provided medical assistance, but despite their efforts he was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

As is standard practice when someone dies following contact with the police, the death has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.

We are not yet in a position to confirm the man’s name, however he is believed to be aged in his 20s and from the Merseyside area.
