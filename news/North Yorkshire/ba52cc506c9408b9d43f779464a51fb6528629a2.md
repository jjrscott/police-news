A man has been arrested and a suspected stolen vehicle recovered after a call from a vigilant member of the public.

North Yorkshire Police were called at about 5pm on 7 April 2016 with a report of erratic driving of a Ford Transit van on the A19 heading towards Selby.

Officers from North Yorkshire Police's Road Crime Team - working on Operation Hawk, the force's clampdown on cross-border criminality - immediately began a search of the area, and the vehicle was stopped at about 8pm on the A19 near Whitley.

The vehicle had been reported stolen from premises in Northallerton overnight on Wednesday 6 April.

The driver, a 47-year-old man from Leeds, was arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle. He has been released on bail, with conditions not to enter North Yorkshire, as enquiries continue.

To report suspicious activity in your area, call North Yorkshire Police on the non-emergency 101 number. If it's an emergency - for example, if a crime is happening now, or there is danger to life - always dial 999.
