Police are appealing for witnesses following an incident on a road in York.

On Monday 12 September 2016, just after 5.45pm, a cyclist was cycling from Clifton Green towards Rawcliffe Lane.

When the cyclist stopped in the right-hand filter lane for Rawcliffe Lane, a dark-coloured 4Ã—4 vehicle, believed to be an Audi, pulled up behind him. The car nudged the rear tyre of the cycle on several occasions. The cyclist got off his cycle, and the car then ran over it, causing extensive damage to the back wheel, before driving off towards Shipton Road. Fortunately, no one was injured during the incident.

This was a busy time of day on a main road in York, and so police are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or has dashcam footage of it or the car involved, to get in touch.

Dial 101, select option 2 and ask for PC John Armstrong or York Police.

Alternatively, email John.Armstrong291@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk. Please quote reference number 12160166372 when passing information.
