Detectives investigating a burglary at Harrogate are appealing for help to locate three pug puppies that were stolen from a flat.

The incident occurred in the Bilton area between 11pm and midnight on Saturday (1 December 2018).

The suspects made off with three 12-week-old female pug puppies.

As part of extensive enquiries to track down the offenders and safely recover the puppies, officers are urging people to come forward if they have possibly been offered female pug puppies for sale since Saturday evening.

One of the pugs is fawn in colour, another has a black face with a pink smudge and an umbilical hernia, and the third is a distinctive silver colour with an umbilical hernia.

__ The offenders are possibly from the West Yorkshire area, therefore it is important that this appeal is shared across the county border.

If you have information about the stolen puppies or you can help the investigation in any way, please call North Yorkshire Police without delay on 101, select option 2, and ask for the Harrogate Serious Crime Team.

Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.

Please quote reference number 12180224233 when providing details about this incident.
