Deputy Chief Constable Tim Madgwick said: "North Yorkshire Police takes its safeguarding responsibilities extremely seriously and we are committed to protecting children from sexual exploitation and other forms of abuse through a joint approach with our statutory and non-statutory partners.

"This referral to the IPCC demonstrates our approach to openness, transparency and independent scrutiny of mistakes that were made. We fully accept the IPCC's recommendations, and in particular, by way of reassurance, draw the public's attention to the comment made by IPCC Commissioner Kathryn Stone OBE when she said that we have acted promptly to put in place new ways of working following the investigation."
