Police are trying to trace members of the public pictured by CCTV who may have information about a sexual assault in York.

A woman was assaulted as she walked along the riverside path between Bridge Street and the Park Inn between 12.30 to 12.45am on Saturday, July 15 2017.

Detectives stress that the four people photographed walking along Riverside Walk towards Lendal Bridge are not suspects.

However, they may have seen or heard something important but not be aware of it.

A man in his 30s has been charged with sexual assault following the incident and appeared in front of magistrates in York last month.

If you can identify any of the people in the CCTV, or have other information about the incident, contact North Yorkshire Police on 101. Please quote incident number 12170124262.
