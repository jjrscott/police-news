North Yorkshire Police's Firearms and Explosives Licensing Department is giving people the chance to ask questions at a live webchat.

Gun owners and members of the public who are interested in how gun licensing works and how the police administer licences will have the chance to quiz the force's licensing experts at the online event, on Monday 1 June 2015.

Dave Coutts, Head of Firearms and Explosives Licensing at North Yorkshire Police, said: "This is the second firearms licensing webchat we have hosted, and is part of our ongoing drive to make us more accessible to our customers whether they are certificate holders or not.

"Our first webchat last year was very successful, attracting more than 70 live attendees and almost 40 questions and comments. These webchats complement other events we have attended, including open days and roadshows, which have also been very well received."

The firearms licensing webchat will take place between 6pm and 7pm on Monday 1 June 2015, at www.northyorkshire.police.uk/webchat. A transcript will also be available to view at that link as soon as the event has finished.

If you cannot make the live event, you can submit questions in advance on Twitter to @NYPFirearmsLic or at the North Yorkshire Police Facebook page.
