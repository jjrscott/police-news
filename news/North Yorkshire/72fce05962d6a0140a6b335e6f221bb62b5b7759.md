North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a serious assault in Northallerton.

At around 11pm on Tuesday 18 October 2016, a group of five masked men were reported to have forced their way into a property on Vicars Croft.

The men threatened the occupants of the house and seriously assaulted a 26-year-old man before fleeing the area. It is believed they ran off towards Bullamoor Road before leaving the area in a car.

Detective Sergeant Simon Hepburn, of the Northallerton Serious Crime Team, said “This was a frightening attack for the occupants of the house and has no doubt caused alarm among residents.

“I'd like to reassure local people that we believe this was an isolated and targeted incident. Nevertheless, we have increased patrols in the area while extensive police enquiries are ongoing to track down the suspects.

“To help the investigation, I urge anyone who recalls seeing any suspicious activity in the area of Vicars Croft at around 11pm on Tuesday 18 October, to come forward without delay.”

Please call North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Simon Hepburn. Or email Simon.Hepburn@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
