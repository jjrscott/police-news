A man has been sentenced to four years in prison after admitting one count of fraud by false representation and one count of perverting the course of justice.

Jeremy Scott, aged 52, was sentenced at York Crown Court this week after an investigation by North Yorkshire Police found he had defrauded a woman out of more than £25’000.

Scott befriended the victim, a woman in her fifties from Harrogate, in October 2013. Scott claimed to be a hugely successful businessman and told many stories about his high-flying lifestyle. He convinced the victim they should buy holiday property together and persuaded her to hand over tens of thousands of pounds as an “interim” measure.

The victim reported Scott to the police after a long string of excuses from him as to why he was not paying her back the money.

Investigator 5517 Graham-Merrett from North Yorkshire Police who investigated the case said;

“Jeremy Scott preys on vulnerable women, passing himself off as a successful business man having friends and associates in high places and promising wealth.

“His selfish criminal behaviour left his victim in financial despair, suffering with her health and living arrangements.

“Scott has shown no remorse for his actions and it is satisfying he is behind bars where he cannot target other victims.”
