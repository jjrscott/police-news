Police are appealing for witnesses following a fatal collision on the A59 near Broughton.

At 11.12pm on Saturday 23 June 2018, officers were called to a report of a collision between a pedestrian and a car on the A59, close to The Bull pub at Broughton.

The incident involved an orange coloured Vauxhall Corsa travelling away from Skipton and a male pedestrian. As a result of the collision, sadly a 29-year-old male pedestrian from the Keighley area died at the scene. The driver of the car, a 31-year-old man from the Barnoldswick area, was left shaken but unhurt and one passenger in the car received minor injuries.

The road was closed until 5.30am Sunday 24 June 2018, to allow police to examine the scene and conduct enquiries.

Police are appealing for any witnesses to the collision, or anyone who stopped and assisted at the scene to contact them. They are also asking for anyone who saw either the vehicle or the pedestrian, who was wearing a suit at the time of the incident, prior to the collision in the area of The Bull pub, to also come forward.

Please dial 101, select option one and pass the information to the Force Control Room. Alternatively you can email the Major Collision Investigation Team - MCIT@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
