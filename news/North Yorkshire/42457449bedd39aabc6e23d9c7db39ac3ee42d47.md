A man who stole between £40,000 to £45,000 from his mother has been jailed following a North Yorkshire Police fraud investigation.

Michael Anthony Stary, 60, of Calder Avenue, York, pleaded guilty to fraud by abuse of position at York Crown Court and was today (Monday 30 April 2018) sentenced to two years and eight months imprisonment.

In January 2011, Stary, along with his sister, was granted joint lasting power of attorney over his 90 year-old mother’s finances.

However, during a routine check of their mother’s accounts in the summer of 2013, Stary’s sister noticed that regular and large amounts of cash had been withdrawn from their mother’s accounts.

Their mother had been placed into a care home the year previously and did not require the use of such large sums of money.

Following an investigation it transpired Stary had been using money from the accounts to fund his own lifestyle and set up a company.

The Crown Court will now be asked to consider a Confiscation Order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.

Detective Sergeant Elaine Arnott from the North Yorkshire Police Safeguarding Unit said:

“Increasing numbers of safeguarding alerts about financial abuse are being directed to Police.

“As attorney for his mother’s financial affairs, Mr Stary stole thousands to fund his own household expenses, home improvements and luxury holidays.

“ Sadly, Mrs Stary died during the investigation and a family is left broken by her son’s dishonesty.

“The sentence reflects how serious this crime is and serves as a reminder to those entrusted with such responsibility.”
