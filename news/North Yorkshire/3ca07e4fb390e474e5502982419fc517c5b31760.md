The incident occurred at around 1am on Sunday (29 July 2018) as the victim was walking home via Rawcliffe Drive after a night out.

She believes she had been followed from Malton Way onto Rawcliffe Lane before being assaulted on Rawcliffe Drive by an unknown man.

The suspect is described as wearing a grey hooded top with the hood up.

Police enquiries in the neighbourhood, including a trawl of council and private CCTV, are ongoing to establish the full circumstances of the incident.

The victim is being supported by specially trained officers while the investigation continues.

Reassurance patrols have also been stepped up in the area to address any community concerns.

Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward who may have witnessed the incident or possibly recall seeing a man in a grey hooded top in the area at the time of the incident.

In particular, they need to speak to two people who came to the assistance of the victim - a woman and a man who was walking his dog.

If you can help the investigation, please call North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 1, and speak to the Force Control Room.
