Following an incident yesterday (Thursday 3 May 2018) on the A64, a 21-year-old man from Leeds has been charged with criminal damage - recklessly endangering life and attempted section 18 - wounding of a police officer.

Police received calls just before 4pm Thursday 3 May 2018, from distressed motorists reporting a shirtless man walking alongside the A64 near Fulford, who was throwing stones and wood at passing vehicles.

He was located, arrested and taken into police custody.

He has been remanded into custody and is due to appear before York Magistrates in the morning (Saturday 5 May 2018)

Detectives have issued an appeal to any drivers who were travelling along the A64 at the time, who captured any dashcam footage of the incident to contact them. Please dial 101, select option 2 and ask to speak to Mike Holden.
