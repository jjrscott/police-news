North Yorkshire Police has issued CCTV images of a man and a women they would like to speak to in connection with the theft of a mobile phone and handbag from the home of an elderly woman in York.

At approx. 5.30pm on Sunday 25 June 2017 a suspect entered the victimâ€™s ground floor flat on Grosvenor Terrace, York through an en-suite bathroom, whilst the victim was asleep in bed.

They took a mobile phone and large dark red Russell and Bromley handbag from the side of the bed, before unlocking and exiting through the front door and leaving the area in an unknown direction, unseen and unheard.

Bank cards from within the handbag were then used by two women in various shops in York city centre, including International Finest Foods on Walmgate.

Police have released CCTV stills of a man and two women that they would like to speak as they many have important information that could assist the investigation.

Anyone with information that could help to identify them should contact us on 101 and speak to the Force Control Room or email or email InvestigationHubYork@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk.

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
