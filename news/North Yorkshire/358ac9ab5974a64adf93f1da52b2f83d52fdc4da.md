Police are appealing for information after a a female cyclist has sustained serious injuries following a collision with a silver coloured Audi estate car.

The collision took place at 12pm on Thursday 26 May on Hull Road in York. The 20-year-old cyclist was travelling out of York along the cycle path on Hull Road in the direction of Grimston Bar.

On reaching a marked cycle crossing, the cyclist turned right to cross the road, passing through some standing traffic. She crossed in front of a car, entering the other car lane running alongside when she was hit by the silver Audi. The impact threw both the cyclist and her bike into the air.

The collision resulted in the cyclist being air lifted to LGI, where she remains in a serious but stable condition.

Police are appealing for any of the drivers of the cars who were stationary at that point in the road, who may of seen the cyclists passing across the lanes, to contact them on 101 and ask to speak to TC Glen Robinson. Alternatively please email Glen.Robinson470@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk . Please quote reference 12160091974.
