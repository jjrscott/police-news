This evening (6 May 2016), Julia Mulligan was re-elected as Police and Crime Commissioner for North Yorkshire.

Commenting on the election result, the Acting Chief Constable of North Yorkshire Police, Tim Madgwick, said:

"I would like to congratulate Julia Mulligan on her re-election.

"The role of Police and Crime Commissioner is an important one, as the Commissioner sets the strategic direction for the Force and holds the police to account on behalf of the public. At North Yorkshire Police we are always striving to provide the best service we possibly can for our communities, so we welcome that constructive focus on the public's priorities for policing.
