Police are appealing for information after a rare bird of prey was found with gunshot wounds.

The red kite, a large, adult female, was found on Friday 25 March at Low Marishes, north of Malton. It had been shot with a shotgun, but was still alive.

North Yorkshire Police wildlife crime officer, PC Jez Walmsley, said: "This is a magnificent bird of prey that has been deliberately targeted and shot. We are extremely lucky to be able to see these birds in the wild here in Ryedale, and as a community we should be appalled that someone has chosen to try to kill it.

"It is lucky that the bird has been found alive and there is still a chance that it might get to live a life in the wild. However, this does not diminish the severity of the crime and I am appealing to anyone who might have information that could assist me in my investigation."

Anyone with information is urged to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Jeremy Walmsley, or email jeremy.walmsley@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

The bird has received medical attention and is being treated at a specialist rescue centre.
