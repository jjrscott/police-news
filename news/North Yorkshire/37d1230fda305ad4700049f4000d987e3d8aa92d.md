North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about an attempted break-in that occurred on Hampden Street in York.

It happened between 12.30pm to 1.20pm on 14 February 2020 and involved a suspect male who was described as white, approximately 5ft 10in tall, slim build and he was wearing dark clothing. He is believed to have had a long rucksack on his back and possibly two or three other smaller camping bags with him.

A resident has come home to find the above male in an alley down the side of their house. When challenged, the man quickly left. The homeowner has checked their property and found a smashed plant pot on the rear patio floor and a mark/scratch on one of the patio doors.

We are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation or who has information about this man should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Nikki Jackson. You can also email nikki.jackson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk.
