Police in York are appealing for witnesses and information about a suspected "road rage" and criminal damage incident which left a 77-year-old man fearing for his safety.

It occurred between 8.30am and 9am on Tuesday 22 September 2020 when the victim was driving his red Skoda Fabia car on the A1237 from Bishopthorpe towards Clifton Moor.

The victim reported that a cream-coloured van, driven by a man, was driving behind him and got too close. When the victim braked to warn the other driver to ease off, the man in the van is alleged to have driven the vehicle in an aggressive manner and kept flashing the headlights.

The Skoda then turned off at the Tesco filling station at Clifton Moor. The man in the van then appeared, got out of the vehicle, and then started shouting and gesturing to the elderly victim. It is alleged a wing mirror on the Skoda was damaged in the incident.

The victim told officers that a woman passenger in the van was also "shouting and screaming" at him.

We are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about whether any one has dash-cam footage of the incident.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Joseph Danson. You can also email joseph.danson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk.

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12200166731.
