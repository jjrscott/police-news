Police are appealing for information after a woman suffered a broken jaw following an incident in Richmond.

The woman, in her 20s, needed hospital treatment following the attack. She was punched in the jaw through an open car window while she was sitting in the passenger seat of a stationary vehicle. A man who was present in the vehicle with the woman was also assaulted during the attack.

It happened around 9.45pm on Friday 9 August 2019 at Reeth Road, Richmond.

Northallerton CID is investigating the incident. A man in his late 20s has been arrested in connection with the incident, and released on bail while enquiries continue. A further suspect, 32-year-old Ross Hemington, who has links to both Richmond and Darlington, is wanted for recall to prison for breach of his licence and he remains at large. Hemington is wanted by police for questioning in connection with the attack on the woman.

Two further men who were involved in the attack on both the woman and the man remain unidentified.

Anyone who witnessed any part of the incident or has information that could help the investigation, and in particular the current whereabouts of Ross Hemington, should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for Northallerton CID.
