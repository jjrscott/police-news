A Northallerton woman has been given a penalty notice for wasting police time after falsely claiming she was sexually assaulted on her way home following a night out in the town.

The 21-year-old woman claimed she had been attacked by a man who ripped her clothing in an alleyway in the early hours of 6 October 2019.

However, following an investigation by North Yorkshire Police officers, the allegations turned out to be untrue.

A police spokesperson said: “We take all reports of sexual assault seriously and investigate the circumstances fully. In this case, it quickly became apparent that the young woman who claimed to be a victim of an attack was making a false report. We are publicising this to reassure the public of Northallerton.”
