Skipton police are appealing for witnesses after two men were assaulted by youths as they tended to a mother who had fallen and broken her ankles.

The group of four family and friends went out for drinks in Skipton on New Year's Eve. At around half past midnight on 1 January 2015, a woman in the group slipped and fell near Christ Church on Carleton Street and sustained serious injuries to both ankles.

While the group were attending to the woman and waiting for an ambulance, a group of around 5 to 10 youths, aged between 15 and 20 have approached them and a verbal altercation took place. The incident escalated, resulting in the victim's son and a friend of the victim being assaulted by the youths.

The victim's son was punched, head-butted and knocked to the ground, sustaining a broken ankle and facial injuries. The family friend was punched in the face, lost a tooth and suffered bruising to their eye.

Police are appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed the incident to contact them.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact Skipton CID on 01423 539752.

If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote reference 12150000546 when passing on information.
