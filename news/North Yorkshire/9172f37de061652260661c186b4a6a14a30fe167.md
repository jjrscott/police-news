A man has been jailed for stabbing a man in a Scarborough pub.

Lee Alexander Hamilton, 28, of Pavilion Square, Scarborough, was charged with wounding with intent and possessing a knife in a public place after an incident at the West Riding pub on Castle Road, on the evening of 21 January 2017.

He subsequently pleaded guilty, and on 5 May 2017 was handed a 14-year sentence, comprising of a term of ten years in prison and an extended period of four years.

DC Steve Monty, of Scarborough Serious Crime Team, said: “This was a very serious offence, that left the victim with significant injuries that have caused him long-term discomfort. The police investigation and length of the sentence show the seriousness with which such crimes will be dealt with by the criminal justice system.”
