Four men have been arrested after a police pursuit through Scarborough.

A Fiat Punto being driven suspiciously failed to stop for officers on Foreshore Road just after midnight, in the early hours of today, Wednesday 24 May 2017.

North Yorkshire Policeâ€™s Roads Policing Group officers immediately attended the area, and pursued the vehicle out of town northwards, through Burniston and into Ravenscar.

The car crashed into a building in Ravenscar at about 12.25am, and all four occupants were arrested.

An 18-year-old man from the Hull area was arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle, driving whilst unfit through drugs, driving dangerously and failing to stop.

Three men aged 22, 22 and 37, also from the Hull area, were arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle.

All four remain in custody while enquiries continue.
