Police investigating how a man came to be injured in a Scarborough street have issued an appeal for two vital witnesses to come forward.

The 37-year-old local man was found with serious head injuries near The Cask pub on Cambridge Terrace at around 1.30pm on Wednesday 31 January 2018.

Police have issued a specific appeal for two people to come forward.

The first is a man is described as aged in his 30s who walked past the ambulance crew attending to the injured man. As he passed he made a comment that he had seen the man approximately two to three hours ago. The man was walking from the front of The Cask, down Grosvenor Road towards Valley Road.

The second relates to a Facebook follower of “Stuff for sale in Scarborough” who posted a comment that they had information, and went on to describe what they saw. Unfortunately the post has since been removed.

Police are urging these two people to contact them as soon as possible as their information could be extremely important to the investigation.

If you believe that is you, or anyone else with information that could assist office, please contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, press option 2 and ask for Scarborough Serious Crime Team.

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800555111.

Please quote reference number 12180017873 when passing on any information.

The injured man remains in a critical condition in hospital.
