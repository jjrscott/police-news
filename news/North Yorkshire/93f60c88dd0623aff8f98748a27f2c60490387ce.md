A duo have today (26/01/16) been jailed after a vulnerable woman was held at knifepoint and forced to withdraw cash from her bank account.

Kerrie-Ann Harrington, 36, and Adam James May, 28, targeted the woman in the Cheltenham Parade area of Harrogate.

They forced her to withdraw a small amount of money from the cashpoint. They also stole her mobile phone.

However, the attack was thwarted by members of the public, who alerted a nearby Police Community Support Officer.

The defendants - both from Harrogate - appeared at York Crown Court for sentencing today.

Harrington was sentenced to two years, six months after pleading guilty to attempted robbery and theft.

May was sentenced to two years, three months after pleading guilty to the same offences.

The incident took place in July last year.

DC Quita Passmore, of North Yorkshire Police's serious crime team, said: "The sentence handed down to these two cowardly offenders today shows that when we catch people who commit such callous crimes, they will be dealt with very robustly.

"This was a horrible experience for the victim. However, it is important for people to remember that these incidents are very rare in Harrogate."
