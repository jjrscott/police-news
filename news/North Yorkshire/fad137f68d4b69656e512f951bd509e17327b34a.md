A police officer swapped New York for North Yorkshire when he paid a flying visit to police in York and Selby.

Bob Stimpson, a 58-year-old full-time police officer in North Branford, Connecticut, had flown over to this country for a family wedding, and took the opportunity to meet officers in North Yorkshire during his visit.

Officer Stimpson worked a shift in York and Selby on Monday 30 May.

He was accompanied by PC Tony Morton in Selby, and the two took the opportunity to talk about the similarities and differences of policing a town 90 miles away from New York compared to a town 15 miles away from York.

He also joined Inspector David Hunter in York, working alongside officers at a number of incidents - and ended up going off duty late due to his attendance at an ongoing incident.

Supported by the York Branch of the International Police Association, the visit helped officers share best practice in front-line policing.

PC Morton said: "It was fascinating to meet Bob - he has lots of great stories to tell, and we had an enjoyable time working together. He flew back home the following day with all our contact details, and I'm sure he will make a good contact between us and our American colleagues."
