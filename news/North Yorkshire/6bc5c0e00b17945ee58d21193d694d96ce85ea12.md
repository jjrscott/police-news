North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information following a suspicious incident that occurred in York yesterday (Tuesday 28 February 2017).

It happened on Whitby Avenue at around 4pm when a 13-year-old boy, who had just got off the school bus, was approached by the passenger of a blue van.

The passenger, believed to be a man in his mid-20s and wearing a grey tracksuit and possibly a cap, lent out of the window and said ‘come here little boy’. Thankfully the boy did the right thing and didn’t approach the van.

Although we believe this is an isolated incident our advice is to always remain vigilant and never get into a car with a stranger.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the public’s assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

Anyone who witnessed the incident is asked to call North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask to speak to the York Serious Crime team.

Please quote reference number 12170034483.
