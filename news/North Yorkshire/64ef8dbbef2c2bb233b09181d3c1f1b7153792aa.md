North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about an assault that occurred on Scalby Road in Scarborough.

It happened at around 3pm on Friday 6 November 2020 and involved three females of secondary school age.

We are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

The victim was dressed in Graham School uniform and the suspects were dressed in parts of the same uniform.
