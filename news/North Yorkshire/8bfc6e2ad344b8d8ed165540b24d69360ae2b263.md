A man has been sentenced at York Crown Court after pleading guilty to two charges of controlling prostitution for gain.

Gary Enticknap, 43, of Skelton Green, Cleveland, was sentenced to six months imprisonment suspended for two years and ordered to do 200 hours of community service. He was also given a restraining order preventing contact with his victims for five years.

Enticknap used adult websites such as Adultwork.com to set up his own agency, calling it 007 Escorts. He arranged for men to see the women either at their home address or in hotels over two to three months, taking a percentage of the money paid to them.

Working as an escort is not illegal in itself, however for a third party to benefit from it is, and falls into the offence of controlling prostitution for gain.

A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: "Enticknap used these women purely for his own gain. We would encourage anyone in a similar position to these victims to contact the police immediately."
