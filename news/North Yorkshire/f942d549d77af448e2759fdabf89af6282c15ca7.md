North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about an assault that occurred in Skipton.

The incident took place on Gargrave Road at approximately 10am on Monday 4 December 2017 when the victim was walking up past St.Stephens Church, which is condemned. At this time the victim saw around five men, thought to be in their late teens, climbing on the building's old garage.

A verbal altercation took place, which resulted in the group of men getting down from the building and walking towards the victim. The victim was then punched in the face and the group of men made off in the direction of Gargrave Road.
