Police have issued CCTV images of two people they would like to speak to in connection with two separate thefts from a shop in Harrogate.

On the afternoon of Wednesday 31 May 2017, a man and a woman entered the Co-op on Leeds Road, Harrogate. They filled a large blue shopping bag with medicinal goods worth £372.98 before leaving the store without making any attempt to pay for the items.

The man and woman then got into a waiting vehicle, which may have been a blue Ford Mondeo, before driving away.

Later that week, on Friday 2 June 2017, the same man and woman entered the same Co-op store on Leeds Road and filled a shopping bag with items worth £175.02 before leaving the store without making any attempt to pay for the items.

On this occasion, the man and woman got into a waiting white van before driving away.

Officers would like to speak to the two people pictured on CCTV as they may have important information that could assist the investigation.
