Police in Harrogate have issued an appeal after a cat was found dead in a local park with his tail and right ear missing.

On Sunday 6 November 2016, police received a call from a veterinary practice after the ginger cat called Max was found dead in the park between Roberts Crescent and Knapping Hill. He had been missing for 10 months prior to being found dead.

Vets believe that his tail and ear were deliberately severed.

Officers are investigating the incident and appealing to anyone who has any information about where Max has been for the past ten months or has any information about who is responsible for attacking him.

Max is described as ginger with white paws, long white "socks" on his back legs and a white patch on his chest.

After being missing for so long, Max's owners were resigned to the fact that they would probably not see him again, but were horrified after finding out what had actually happened to their beloved pet.

Anyone with any information that could help the investigation is asked to call North Yorkshire Police on 101 and ask to speak to the Safer Neighbourhood Service Desk. Or email neil.himsworth@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote reference number 12160201717 when passing on information.

The RSPCA have been informed.
