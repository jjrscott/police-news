North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a damage-only road traffic collision which occurred in the village of Ravenscar near Scarborough.

It happened just before midnight on Wednesday 15 June 2017 when a black Hyundai i20 collided with a parked taxi outside the Raven Hall Hotel in Ravenscar.

When the driver of the taxi got out to exchange details with the other driver, the Hyundai drove off and out of the grounds. It is believed that it then left Ravenscar heading towards Whitby on the A171.

We are conducting enquiries and wish to hear from anybody who may have seen the Hyundai prior to or following the collision.
