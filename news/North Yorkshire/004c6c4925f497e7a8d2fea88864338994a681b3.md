Superintendent Dave Hannan of North Yorkshire Police, the Silver Commander for Stages 1 and 3 of the Tour de Yorkshire, said:

"The second Tour de Yorkshire has been an incredible success, showcasing the very best of Yorkshire to a world-wide audience.

"From a policing and partnership perspective, I am delighted that the event has again been delivered safely and securely.

"This is testament to the detailed planning undertaken by the emergency services in conjunction with local authorities and the event organisers, Welcome to Yorkshire and Amaury Sport Organisation.

"I pass on my sincere thanks to everyone who has played their part in making this an occasion to remember, including the outstanding support from thousands of residents and visitors who created a carnival atmosphere all along the race route."
