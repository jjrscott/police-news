Police in York are appealing for a woman who was racially abused to come forward.

Officers are aware of reports in the media from a third party about a racially aggravated verbal attack on the woman in York. The incident has not been reported to the police.

It is believed the woman is a young Swedish mother who was with her two young children when she was racially abused in the Fulford area of York on Saturday, 25 June 2016.

Superintendent Adam Thomson said: “I am appealing to the woman who was abused to please contact us and report what happened.

“I am also appealing to anyone else who has any information that could help identify the perpetrators to contact us.

“This type of crime will not be tolerated in the City of York or anywhere else in our county and anyone who behaves in such a way will face the full force of the law.

“I also encourage anyone else who has been the victim of similar crimes, to please contact us. All reports of hate crime are taken extremely seriously and will be thoroughly investigated.

Anyone with any information, or who wants to report an incident of hate crime, is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police. Dial 101, press 1 and pass information on to the force control room.

If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Alternatively, If you do not wish to involve the police you can report a hate crime to Stop Hate UK _www.stophateuk.org/report-hate-crime/_
