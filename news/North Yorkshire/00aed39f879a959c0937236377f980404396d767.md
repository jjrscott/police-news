North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a house burglary that occurred in Stokesley.

It happened on Glebe Road between 10am and 1pm on 14th May 2015 and involved the offender/s forcing entry through a locked door to the home of the elderly residents while they were out.

Whilst inside the offenders searched the premises and stole cash kept in one of the rooms

Sgt Nick Hill, of Stokesley Safer Neighbourhood Team, said "This is a terrible crime committed against elderly residents which has understandably left them very shaken. The victims have lost a large amount of their savings so it's vital anyone with any information comes forward immediately. I would also strongly urge all residents not to keep quantities of cash in their own homes, instead keep it in a savings account or similar."

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the public's assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about any unusual or suspicious vehicles or persons seen in the vicinity around the time of the burglary

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for PC 1275 Foley You can also email Ian.Foley@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
