North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about two suspicious incidents involving a van driver in the Aiskew and Bedale area.

The first incident happened in Aiskew on A684 Bedale Road, near to the railway level crossing, at 4.30pm on Tuesday 1 December 2020.

Two 11-year-old girls who were approached by a man in a white van. He got out and shouted to the girls who became frightened and ran home.

The second incident occurred about 8.15 am on Tuesday 15 December 2020 at the same location. On this occasion the girls were walking to school and the same van and driver drove slowly alongside and in front of the girls. The girls reported the incident to school and police.
