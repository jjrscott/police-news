Temporary Chief Constable Lisa Winward said: “It is very pleasing that North Yorkshire continues to be the safest and lowest crime area in England and Wales.

“This reflects the professionalism and dedication of everyone connected to North Yorkshire Police, the effective partnership working with our local authorities and other community groups, and the vital support from local residents.

“While the 7% increase in crime in our area is lower than the 13% increase nationally, we are not satisfied and we will not become complacent.

“We remain 100% focused on reversing this trend in North Yorkshire through strong neighbourhood policing and our proactive approach to tackling and deterring offenders who come into North Yorkshire from other counties.”
