A man has been jailed for 15 months for possessing indecent images of children.

Craig Scott Murfitt, 30, from Bedale was sentenced at Teesside Crown Court on 14 August 2017 after pleading guilty to two charges of possessing indecent images and one of breaching a Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO).

He was also issued with an indefinite Sexual Harm Prevention Order and ordered to sign the sex offenders register for 10 years.

Murfitt had previously been given a nine-month suspended sentence in 2016 for similar offences and was issued with a Sexual Harm Prevention Order.

The latest offences were discovered during a routine visit by public protection officers as part of monitoring under the SHPO when his mobile phone and tablet were seized. After the devices were examined, officers found further indecent images of children.

Detective Constable Matthew Mitchell of Northallerton Serious Crime Team, said: “Sadly Murfitt did not learn from his previous sentence and has committed further offences for which he has now been jailed.

“For every indecent photograph, a child has suffered the worst kind of abuse imaginable. This sentence sends a clear message that you can't hide behind a screen, the criminal justice system will not tolerate your part in fuelling the demand for these sickening images.”
