North Yorkshire Police are advising residents of the Starbeck and Granby areas of Harrogate to be vigilant following a spate of burglaries which took place in the area overnight between 28 and 29 August 2016.

Three properties in close proximity were targeted – Avenue Street, Greenfields Avenue and Wedderburn Road. It is believed that thieves gained entry through unlocked doors and windows and stole items such as purses, wallets, mobiles and tablets along with a quantity of cash.

Inspector Penny Taylor of the Harrogate South Neighbourhood Policing Team said "Whilst Harrogate is a safe area, the number of burglaries does unfortunately tend to increase over the summer months. With the warmer weather residents may inadvertently leave doors and windows open, which then leaves their property at risk of an opportunistic thief. We advise that all residents check their windows and doors each night before going to bed, to ensure that their home is secure."
