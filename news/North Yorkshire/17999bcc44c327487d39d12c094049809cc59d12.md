An uninsured vehicle has been taken off the roads thanks to the vigilance of a member of the public in Catterick Village.

At 1pm on Tuesday 9 May 2017, a member of the public called North Yorkshire Police on 101 to report seeing a car being driving up and down through the village in a suspicious way.

An officer attended to check out the report, and located a foreign-registered black VW Passat nearby on High Green.

Checks on the two men in the car were carried out; the car was seized by police; and the driver, from West Yorkshire, will be dealt with for having no insurance.

North Yorkshire Police are urging people, particularly in rural areas, to be vigilant, and report any suspicious activity to the police, as part of its Call It In campaign. Even if it doesnâ€™t need an immediate response, every piece of information helps officers build up a picture and could prove vital in bringing criminals to justice.

Call North Yorkshire Police on 101 to report suspicious circumstances, or dial 999 in an emergency.
