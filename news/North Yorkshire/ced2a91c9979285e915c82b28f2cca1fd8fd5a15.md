We are appealing for witnesses and information about an incident that occurred in Scarborough on Friday 7 June..

It happened on Ramshill Road at around 10.15pm and involved three men fighting in the street, at one point stopping traffic as the fight spilled into the road.

Three men from the local area have since been arrested on suspicion of affray and released on conditional bail while enquiries continue.

We are requesting the publicâ€™s help to establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident. In particular, we would like to speak to anyone who may have been on Ramshill Road at that time and may have approached one of these men or anyone whose vehicle was stopped due to the fight taking place in the carriageway.
