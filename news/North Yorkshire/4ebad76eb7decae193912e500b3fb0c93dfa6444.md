NYP have issued 2216 COVID notices in total since March 2020 *.

Speaking at the North Yorkshire Local Resilence Forum yesterday, Superintendent Mike Walker said:

“Sadly this week we marked another very sombre milestone. Covid has now taken over 100,000 lives and our thoughts and condolences go out to all the families who have lost someone to this devastating virus.

“Health experts have also told us despite seeing a decline in infection rates, the death rate will stay at current levels for some weeks to come, which is why it’s so important that we keep going. The decrease in infection rates is good news, but it’s far too soon to say if this is a sustainable downward trend. This is not the time to be complacent. Our hospitals and our NHS colleagues remain under significant pressure, so we must continue to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. Thank you to everyone who is continuing to put the lives and health of others above their own needs by sticking to the restrictions – you are life savers.

“North Yorkshire Police remains committed to our task - keeping people safe. We will continue to engage, explain and encourage public adherence to the regulations and we will continue to take enforcement action against those whose flagrant breaches put other people’s lives at risk.”

*Please note – these are the figures which have been approved for submission to ACRO and may be subject to further change.
