North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about an attempted robbery that occurred at a bus stop on Stonebow in York.

The incident took place between 11.50am and 12.15pm on Wednesday 12 February 2020 when a woman was waiting to catch the bus with her child in a pushchair and her partner who was standing nearby.

An unknown male approached the female, held one of her arms before attempting to grab her phone from her. He was luckily stopped by the female's partner but remained at the bus stop, which was full of other members of the public, as the woman got on the bus.

The male is described as White, in his late 20s, slim build, approximately 5ft 10ins in height, short dark coloured hair, with thin sunken cheeks and a light stubble beard. He was wearing bright orange lensed glasses which were frameless at the bottom and spoke with a European accent.

We are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident. In particular, we are appealing for information from any witnesses who were at the bus stop at the time of the incident.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Joshua Tulip or email Joshua.Tulip@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12200025073.
