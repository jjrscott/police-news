North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a series of attempted shed burglaries that occurred in Harrogate.

It happened at Claro Road Allotments overnight on 19 March into 20 March 2017, where 19 sheds have been identified as having been damaged, some having been entered.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about anyone who was seen to enter the allotment during the night in question. The allotment is private and is kept locked. So far there is nothing to suggest any of the tenants entered the allotment on the night the offences took place.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for Adam Smith. You can also email adam.smith@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12170047027.
