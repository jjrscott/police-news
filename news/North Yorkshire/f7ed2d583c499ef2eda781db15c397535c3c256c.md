Police in Harrogate are urging residents to prevent sneak-in burglaries by thinking about security when enjoying the warm weather.

Officers say people can let their guard down during the summer months, leaving windows open and doors unlocked even when they go out.

Temporary Detective Sergeant Tom Barker of Harrogate Investigation Hub said: "Naturally, people want to leave doors and windows open when the temperatures are warmer.

"Despite North Yorkshire being one of the safest places to live in the country, there are individuals who are intent on stealing property, and will sneak into homes given the opportunity.

"This is a gentle reminder to keep doors and windows secure where possible, particularly if you are leaving the house."

Det Sgt Barker added: "We have a team of detectives in Harrogate Investigation Hub who are committed to making sure that any individuals who are out there committing burglaries will be arrested and prosecuted accordingly.‚Äù

If you see someone acting suspiciously in residential areas, please report them to North Yorkshire Police by calling 101 and selecting option 1. Always call 999 if you see a crime taking place.
