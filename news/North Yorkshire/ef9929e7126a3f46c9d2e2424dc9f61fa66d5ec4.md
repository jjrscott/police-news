Community intelligence led police to disused barn

Yesterday (21 October 2020) officers from North Yorkshire Police’s Catterick Neighbourhood Policing Team attended a disused barn on farmland in the village of Hunton to find a large-scale cannabis grow in its early stages.

Members of the local community had reported suspicious activity at the barn with a number of vehicles and people coming and going to the location between Leyburn and Bedale. Police acted quickly and on arrival at the barn found a well-organised hydroponics system, electricity meters bypassed and a quantity of cannabis plants in the early stages of cultivation.

Local Inspector Mark Gee said:

“We’re very grateful to the local community who reported their concerns and as a result we were able to act quickly and dismantle this operation.

“Often those involved in the actual cultivation and set up on the ground can be vulnerable and may be exploited by organised crime groups so putting a stop to these types of operations has a far wider reaching impact than simply stopping drugs from becoming available in our communities.

“Everyone can play their part by remaining vigilant and reporting any suspicious behaviour to the police so that we can take action.”

If you have any information regarding this location or any other information then please call 101 to report this. If you wish to remain anonymous you can call Crimestoppers on: 0800 555 111
