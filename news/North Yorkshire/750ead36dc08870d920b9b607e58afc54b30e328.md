Earlier today the Metropolitan Police Service announced the occurrence of a terrorist incident at Westminster in which four people died and at least 20 people were injured.

Commenting on the day’s events, the Chief Constable of North Yorkshire Police, Dave Jones, said:

“By now many people will have seen news coverage of the attack that took place at Westminster earlier today. I would like to reassure the public that there is no intelligence to suggest that there has been any change in the level of risk here in North Yorkshire. Nevertheless, in line with other police forces, we will continue to keep our contingency planning under close review, and make careful assessments of the security around any special events.

"On behalf of North Yorkshire Police I would like express my deepest sympathy to those who have lost loved ones, or who have suffered as a result of this attack. Our thoughts are with those people, and with our colleagues in the Metropolitan Police and other emergency services at this difficult time.”
