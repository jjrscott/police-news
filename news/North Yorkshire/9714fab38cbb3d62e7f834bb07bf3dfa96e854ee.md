A 35 year-old man from Beeston, Leeds was arrested yesterday, 6 July 2017, in a joint effort between North Yorkshire Police and West Yorkshire Police.

Originally arrested in connection with a number of offences across both counties, three of which were in North Yorkshire - Boroughbridge, Harrogate and Selby - he was later charged with 14 counts of burglary, five counts of fraud and one count of robbery.

Speaking after the arrest, Detective Constable Quita Passmore of North Yorkshire Police said:

“These awful crimes can have a huge impact on the victims and their families.

“Residents should be reassured that we will work with other forces to maximise resources to enable us carry out the most detailed investigations that we can, and we will work tirelessly to catch and prosecute individuals who commit crimes within our area.

“Anyone who thinks they might have been a victim of burglary or who sees anyone acting suspiciously should report it to the police on 101 or 999 in an emergency.”

The man has been remanded in custody until the trial.
