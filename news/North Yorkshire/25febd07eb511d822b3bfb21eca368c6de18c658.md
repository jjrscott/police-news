A Peterborough man has been jailed for three years and eight months for bringing heroin and cocaine into Harrogate.

Musiiwa Kanhukamwe, 27, was arrested by Harrogate’s dedicated county lines team - known as Operation Expedite - on 4 January 2020, when officers stopped a car he was travelling in at New Park roundabout, Harrogate.

Musiiwa Kanhukamwe

Following a search, heroin and cocaine with a street value of £4,750 was found in his possession. He was subsequently charged with possessing crack cocaine with intent to supply and possessing heroin with intent to supply.

He appeared at court two days later on 6 January and pleaded guilty to both offences. He was sentenced at York Crown Court on 5 February 2020.

Detective Sergeant Marcus Dawson of Harrogate’s Operation Expedite team, said: “North Yorkshire Police is committed to targeting those involved in county lines drug dealing. The swift justice and length of sentence handed out to Kanhukamwe is a clear demonstration of that commitment and the wider criminal justice system’s determination to rid our streets of drugs.”
County lines is a form of organised crime in which drug dealers from urban areas exploit vulnerable people - including children - and force them to deal drugs in smaller towns and cities. It takes its name from the mobile phone lines used by dealers to communicate between towns, take orders & conduct their “business”. The lines are used to advertise drugs for sale and mass text messages are sent to users letting them know where and when they can buy drugs. The lines become valuable protected “brands”.

If you suspect drug dealing in your neighbourhood. Please call the police on 101.

If you prefer to remain anonymous, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

In an emergency always call 999.

The signs of drug dealing can include
• Increased callers at a property at all times of the day or night
• Increase in cars pulling up for short periods of time
• Different accents at a property
• Antisocial behaviour at a property
• Not seeing the resident for long periods of time
• Drug-related rubbish – small plastic bags, syringes
• Windows covered or curtains closed for long periods
