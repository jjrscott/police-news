Officers were contacted by ambulance services at 6.20pm Monday 7 October 2019 with a report of a black Seat Ibiza having left an unclassified road between Bedale and Snape, known as Kings Keld Bank, and collided with a tree.

Sadly, despite the efforts of members of the public and ambulance staff, the 48-year-old male driver of the Ibiza died at the scene from his injuries. The road was closed for around four hours to allow the Major Collision Investigation Team to carry out a full investigation of the scene.
