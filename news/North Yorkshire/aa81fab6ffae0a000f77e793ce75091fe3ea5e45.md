Police in Harrogate have issued CCTV images of three men they would like to speak to following the theft of two bicycles from the bike sheds at Taylors Ltd in Harrogate.

In happened between 7.55pm and 8.10pm on Monday 2 October 2017 when three men were observed on CCTV entering the car park of Taylors Ltd on Plumpton Park, Harrogate before leaving the car park in possession of two bikes.
