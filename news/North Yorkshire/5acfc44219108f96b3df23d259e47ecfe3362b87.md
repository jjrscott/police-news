A Northallerton man who admitted possessing indecent images of children has been handed a suspended jail sentence.

Paul Richard Tonkin, aged 55 and of Thirsk Road, was sentenced to eight months' imprisonment suspended for two years during a sentencing hearing at Teesside Crown Court on Friday 30 January 2015.

He had earlier pleaded guilty to 10 counts of possessing indecent images of children.

Tonkin was arrested on 1 October 2013, after information was passed to North Yorkshire Police from CEOP (Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre).

Detective Constable Sarah Jobe, of Northallerton CID, said: "Possessing indecent images of children is a disgusting offence which Paul Tonkin has quite rightly paid the price for.

"This case shows the value of the police and agencies such as CEOP working together to ensure the safety of children on line."

If you would like to report sexual abuse, you can contact North Yorkshire Police on 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
