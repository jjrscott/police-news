North Yorkshire Police are appealing for information following a burglary at a rural property between Appleton Wiske and Worsall.

It happened at some point between 6.30pm on Tuesday 18 August and 8.30am the following morning.

The suspects broke into the property and stole jewellery including high value watches, electrical items and a cabinet containing two shotguns.

One of the watches is of great sentimental value to the owner as it was presented to their grandfather. It is described as a gold, Smith’s gent’s watch and is engraved on the back with “British Railways in appreciation”. Similar to the watch in this photograph.

Officers are appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time and saw any suspicious vehicles or people to contact them.

They are also urging anyone who is offered the Smiths watch, a 12 gauge Beretta Silver Pigeon shotgun with a distinctive bent sight, or a Baikel standard shotgun for sale, to contact them.

Anyone else who has any information that could assist the investigation including motorists in the area with any dash-cam footage of potential suspicious vehicles, are also asked to get in touch.

If you can assist the investigation, please call North Yorkshire Police on 101 and pass information for incident number 12200144219

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, or online at crimestoppers-uk.org
