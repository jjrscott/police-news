North Yorkshire Police are appealing for witnesses and information about criminal damage to a motor vehicle that occurred in the Castle Car Park, Tower Street, York .

The criminal damage happened at around at 2.30am on Wednesday 26 June 2019 and involved three youths approaching a woman and her partner, who were collecting their car from the Castle car park on Tower Street in York.

The youths then caused damage to the victim's car by throwing cans at it and kicking and punching it.

Police are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident, and would appeal to any nearby businesses with CCTV coverage of the car park to review their footage and contact officers if they have captured any relevant footage.
