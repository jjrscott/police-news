A man and a woman, who climbed up a rig at the hydraulic fracturing site in Kirby Misperton in the early hours of Saturday 21 October, have been brought down safely from the rig.

The 21 year old woman and the 28 year old man have been arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass and criminal damage. They both remain in custody at this time.

The pair were issued with safety harnesses and were helped down safely from the rig by police officers working on the site. The woman came down at 10am and the man at 10.25am, today (Sunday 22 October 2017).

Superintendent Mike Walker said:

“This incident has thankfully been brought to a safe conclusion.

“From the outset, the safety and welfare of the individuals who had climbed the rig was of paramount importance.

“We work with all those involved to make sure any protest activity is as safe and peaceful as possible, however, we have a duty to take appropriate action if this activity poses any danger”.
