With its rolling countryside, picturesque market towns and grand coastline North Yorkshire is undoubtedly a beautiful place to live, visit and work.

However, it’s when our officers start their shifts in the early morning or late at night that the beauty of our county can really come into its own. Here we take a look at some of the best sunrises and sunsets we’ve seen in North Yorkshire through the eyes of our officers.
