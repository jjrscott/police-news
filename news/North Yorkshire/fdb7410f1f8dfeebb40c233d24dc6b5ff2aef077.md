Do you know this man captured on CCTV in Castleton? Officers believe he may hold information vital to an ongoing fraud investigation involving gift cards.

On the morning of Sunday, 9 April, a man entered the co-op store on the High Street and attempted to buy gift boxes believed to be containing gift cards. The gift boxes were scanned and therefore activated before the man left without paying and staff realised the boxes had been emptied with Â£255 worth of gift cards being removed.

A similar offence was attempted in Staithes but the transaction was thwarted.

Anyone who can identify the man in the CCTV is urged to contact North Yorkshire Police quoting reference 12170060310 with information.

If you wish to remain anonymous the independent charity Crimestoppers should be contacted on 0800 555 111.
