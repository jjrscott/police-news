A man is due at court charged with assault in York.

The 29 year-old is suspected of spitting at a member of shop staff and making comments to him about getting Coronavirus at around 7pm on Sunday 29 March.

Officers were immediately deployed to the shop and a man was arrested shortly after.

Following questioning in custody, the man was charged with assault and is due to appear at York Magistrates’ Court on Thursday 7 May 2020.

He has been released on conditional bail until his court appearance.

North Yorkshire Police’s Chief Inspector Fee Willey of York and Selby Command said:
