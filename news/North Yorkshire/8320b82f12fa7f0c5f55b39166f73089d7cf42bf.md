North Yorkshire Police have confirmed that the collar number belonging to the police officer who died over the weekend has been retired.

The force confirmed that the serving North Yorkshire Police officer who died on Sunday 7 October 2018 was PC Mick Atkinson and his collar number, 1066, was retired the following morning after his death.

The officer had started his service as a Police Constable in Scarborough before moving in recent years into the Dog Support Unit as a Dog Handler.

Chief Constable Lisa Winward said:

“Mick’s death this weekend has come as a great shock to all.

“As a mark of respect, his collar number, 1066, has been retired and will not be reissued to any other officer who joins North Yorkshire Police.

"We are all very touched by the kind words from members of the public and our thoughts remain with Mick’s family, friends and colleagues at this extremely difficult time.”
