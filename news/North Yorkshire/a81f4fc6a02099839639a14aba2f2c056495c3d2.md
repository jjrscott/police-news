Extra police patrols are taking place in Craven to combat crimes linked to longer nights.

Officers are focusing on home and vehicle security, as offences can spike at this time of year when the nights draw in.

They will carry out extra patrols this week from 4pm until midnight, concentrating on Crosshills, Kildwick and Sutton – areas that are particularly susceptible to cross-border crime.

Craven Neighbourhood Policing Sergeant Paul Evans said: “Burglars and other criminals like to work under the cover of darkness, so it’s important to be alert at this time of year.

“But if people take basic crime prevention steps and work with us, we can make a real difference not just in catching offenders but also in stopping crimes happening in the first place.

“Our mini operation this week aims reassure people, share crime prevention advice and detect offences.”

Sgt Evans urged householders to take the following advice:

• a well-lit home gives the impression that someone is in
• use timer switchers to turn lights on while you are out
• don’t leave curtains closed during the day, only in the evening and overnight
• lock all windows and doors
• keep valuable items out of view
• keep gates well secured

If you see anyone acting suspiciously around properties, you can report it to North Yorkshire Police on 101. If you see a crime in progress, always dial 999.
