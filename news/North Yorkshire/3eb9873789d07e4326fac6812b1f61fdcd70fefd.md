Police are trying to trace the driver of a van that collided with a car in central Northallerton today.

Officers believe the driver of a red Bedford-type van failed to stop and report the incident.

The incident happened on the roundabout near Tesco at the end of Northallerton High Street.

A car was travelling from the High Street across the roundabout to the A168 when it collided with the van, which approached from East Road.

The van spun before it was driven off in the direction it came from.

The driver is described as a white, middle-aged man of medium build with dark hair.

The van, believed to be V-registration, is likely to have been badly damaged.

The incident happened just after 8.30am today and police are carrying out a number of lines of enquiry to locate the driver.

Anyone who witnessed the incident, recognises the description of the van or has dashcam footage of the collision should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for 1467.
