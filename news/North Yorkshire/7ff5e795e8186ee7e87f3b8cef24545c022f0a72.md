Police are appealing for witnesses after a large number of vehicles had their tyres slashed in Colburn.

Overnight into Tuesday 18 August 2015, more than 20 vehicles parked in Colburn and Brough with St Giles were attacked.

Officers investigating the incidents are particularly keen to speak to two men seen walking in Colburn at about 5.15am, as they may have important information that could assist the investigation.

PC Mark Wood, of Richmond Police, said: "This mindless damage has caused great inconvenience to a large number of Colburn residents. I am appealing for anyone who has any information about these incidents to contact me straight away."

Anyone who can help officers with their enquiries is urged to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for PC Mark Wood, or Richmond Police.

If you prefer not to give your name, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Please quote reference number 12150144142 when passing information about these incidents.

Wednesday 19 August 2015.
