North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about criminal damage that occurred in Scarborough.

It happened on Oxcliff in Barrowcliff, Scarborough between 6pm and midnight on 7 April 2015 and involved a number of properties having their windows broken and a live lamppost being cut down and thrown through a window. Naturally this damage has caused a significant financial loss to the housing associations that own the properties and the council.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the public's assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about anyone who may have seen people acting suspiciously in the area or who witnessed the damage being caused.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for PC Michael Tinsley.

You can also email forcecontrol@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
