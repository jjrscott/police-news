Northallerton Police Station’s front counter service has moved to North Yorkshire Police’s new headquarters at Alverton Court, half a mile across town.

There is no change in the front counter’s opening hours – which remain 8am to 8pm seven days a week – or the services it provides.

That means people can still make enquiries or report crime face-to-face seven days a week in Northallerton town centre.

They also have access to more community facilities at Alverton Court, which is next to the fire station on Crosby Road.

These include a community meeting room which clubs, societies or other community groups can use until 7.30pm, and a charity-run coffee shop.

For more information about the community room, including booking instructions, visit www.northyorkshire.police.uk/about/communityroom
