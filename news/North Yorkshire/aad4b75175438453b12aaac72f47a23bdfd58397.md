Police are appealing for witnesses after a horse rider was injured in an incident on the B6265 between Ripon and Pateley Bridge.

It happened at about 1.30pm on Tuesday 25 July near Sawley, at the junction of the B6265 and Sawley Moor Lane. A small red hatchback car travelling towards Pateley Bridge overtook a tractor which was towing a trailer carrying bales of hay. As it did so, two horses being ridden in the opposite direction became spooked and one threw its rider.

The driver of the red car returned and apologised, but left the scene without leaving any details.

The injured rider, a woman in her 30s, was taken by the Yorkshire Air Ambulance to Leeds General Infirmary, where she received treatment for her injuries before being discharged later that day.

TC Rob Roberts, of Harrogate Roads Policing Group, said: “I need to speak to the drivers of the red hatchback car and the tractor, in order to establish the full circumstances behind this incident. I would also like to hear from anyone who saw any of the vehicles involved. If you have information that could assist the investigation, please contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, quoting reference number NYP-25072017-0272 or email rob.roberts@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk.”
