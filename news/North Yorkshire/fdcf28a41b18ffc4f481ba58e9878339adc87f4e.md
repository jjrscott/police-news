Two men have been arrested and 42 cannabis plants seized from a property in Harrogate.

On Thursday 14 December 2017, officers carried out a warrant under the Misuse of Drugs Act at a house on Regent Terrace. Inside the property, in a first floor bedroom, they found a cannabis grow consisting of 42 plants and growing equipment.

The plants and equipment have been seized and although officers can’t confirm the potential street value of the plants at this time, it is believed to be in the thousands.

Two men from Harrogate aged 49 and 36 were arrested. The 36-year-old was arrested on suspicion of cannabis production and the 49-year-old on suspicion of possessing cannabis with intent to supply. Both men have been released while under investigation.
