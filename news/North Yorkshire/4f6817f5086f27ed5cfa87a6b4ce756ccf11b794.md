Detectives investigating two aggravated burglaries at Cowling, near Keighley, have arrested a 19-year-old man from Bradford.

The first incident occurred at a house on Acre Road just before 4am on Sunday 30 August 2020.

Offenders broke into the property and threatened the homeowner while he was in bed. The owner managed to chase them away.

At around 4.40am on Saturday 12 September 2020, a house was entered on Bannister Walk and again the homeowner was threatened while he was in bed. The offenders made off with the manâ€™s car.

Following extensive enquiries, a suspect was arrested in Bradford during the early hours of Tuesday 22 December. He was questioned and released on conditional police bail while the investigations continue.
