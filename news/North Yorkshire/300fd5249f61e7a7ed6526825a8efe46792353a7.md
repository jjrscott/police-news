A seven-year-old boy suffered cuts and bruises after being struck by a car in Selby.

The collision with the silver Kia Picanto happened on Barlby Road at about 3.25pm on Monday 19 January 2015

The boy was taken by ambulance to York District Hospital with what, initially, were thought to be serious injuries to his legs, body and head.

However, following a medical assessment and treatment, it was confirmed he had escaped serious injury.

Local diversions were in place until 5.25pm while police collision investigators examined the scene.

The driver of the Kia, a 24-year-old woman from Selby, went to the police station as a voluntary attendee to be interviewed in connection with the collision. She was reported for summons for driving without due care and attention and contravening a traffic signal.

Witnesses or anyone with information about the incident are asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Steven James or Roads Policing Group Tadcaster.

Or email Steven.James771@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk quoting reference 12150010514.
