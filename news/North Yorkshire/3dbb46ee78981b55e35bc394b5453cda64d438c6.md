Around 9.50am on Saturday 18 January a fatal incident occurred at Piave Lines Barracks, Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire. A 58-year-old man from Richmond, a contractor, was carrying out maintenance on a Wolfhound military vehicle when he became trapped. He was given CPR but sadly died at the scene.

The man has now been named as Alistair Ferguson and his family have issued the following tribute:

_Alistair Ferguson was a selfless and loving husband, father, grandfather and friend. He greeted everything in life with a smile on his face and a positive attitude._

_Alistair was very committed, dedicated and took great pride in his work whilst employed at DSG/Babcock. During this time he volunteered to be deployed on two tours to Afghanistan and he was truly honoured to serve his country._

_Words cannot describe the shock and grief we are feeling. This tragic death should not have happened and we hope that no family ever has to go through this again._

_We thank everyone for their kind words and ask that you kindly give us the privacy to grieve in peace._

An investigation into this incident is ongoing, led by North Yorkshire Police at this stage and working with the Health and Safety Executive.
