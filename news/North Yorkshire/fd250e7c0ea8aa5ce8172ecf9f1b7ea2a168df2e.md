Our statement following the conclusion of the inquest into the death of Gavin Egan in Scarborough.

Deputy Chief Constable Tim Madgwick said: “Firstly may we offer our deepest sympathy to Mr Egan’s family and friends following his death. Now that the facts of the case have been established through the conclusion of the inquest, we sincerely hope that Mr Egan’s loved ones now have a degree of closure.

“It’s important that our response to the incident is seen the context of the events on the morning that Mr Egan died, including the fact that the initial call from the man who rescued Mr Egan was made to the ambulance service who attended and carried out a 38-minute search for Mr Egan. We were called approximately half an hour after this first call and arrived at the scene 15 minutes later. A further short search was carried out by our officer and discontinued. Tragically, Mr Egan’s body was recovered from the lake later that morning.

“The coroner recognised that the search carried out by our officer was reasonable, given the information available at the time.”
