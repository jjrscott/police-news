North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a collision on Seamer Road in Scarborough.

It happened at 4.50pm on 19 September and involved a cyclist and white BMW or Audi. It is believed the actions of the BMW / Audi may have caused the cyclist to come off their bike.

We are appealing for witnesses to the collision or anyone who recalls seeing the vehicle(s) prior to the collision to get in touch as soon as possible to assist the investigation.

In particular, we are appealing for information about the white BMW / Audi, including any registration plate information or details of drivers.
