A man has been arrested on suspicion of seven different offences after North Yorkshire Police officers stopped a car near Topcliffe.

Officers became aware of a VW Golf in suspicious circumstances travelling through the county on the evening of Saturday 18 April 2020. They followed the vehicle, and it stopped at 5.55pm in Topcliffe, near Thirsk.

Due to a strong smell of cannabis in the car, a drugs wipe was conducted on the driver, which tested positive for cocaine and cannabis.

The vehicle was searched, and officers located suspected class A and B drugs, as well as a number of bank cards.

As a result, the driver, a 25-year-old Harrogate man, was arrested on suspicion of drug driving, driving without insurance, driving without a licence, possession of a class A drug, possession of a class B drug, theft of a motor vehicle, and theft.

Later the same day, he was released under investigation, while enquiries continue.
