Police are appealing for information to trace the driver of a vehicle who may have vital information about a road traffic collision.

On Tuesday 15 May 2018 at 7.55am a road traffic collision occurred on the A168 southbound between the Sowerby on-slip and the Dalton turn off-slip.

Police attended the incident and a black Ford Fiesta, a white Ford Transit van and a black Volkswagen Golf were recovered from the scene. No one was seriously injured in the collision, but the driver and passenger from the Ford van were taken to James Cook University Hospital as a precaution.

However, witnesses at the scene reported another vehicle, which was driving along the carriageway prior to the collision and officers are keen to trace the driver, as they may have information which could assist the investigation.

The car was described as a small black car, which following the collision, is thought to have turned through the crash barriers opposite Rising Sun Farm and continued on the northbound carriageway.

Police are appealing for any witnesses to the collision, or anyone who saw the small black car to contact them on 101, select option 2 and ask to speak to PC Julie Brown. Alternatively you can email Julie.Brown@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
