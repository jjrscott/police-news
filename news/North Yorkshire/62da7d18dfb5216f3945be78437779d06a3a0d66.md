A man is due to appear in court charged with burglary of a boat in Whitby harbour.

At around 4am on the morning of Sunday 27 August 2017, police were alerted by a vigilant member of the public after a man and woman were seen on a passenger pleasure boat in suspicious circumstances.

Officers attended the scene and found a man on board the boat.

Officers arrested the 41-year-old man from Middlesbrough on suspicion of burglary. He was questioned by police and later charged with the offence. He is due to appear at Scarborough Magistrates’ Court on 14 September 2017.

Detective Constable David Adams of Scarborough Investigation Hub, said: “I would like to thank the vigilant member of the public who acted on their instincts and called this incident into the police as it was in progress. Officers were able to attend the scene and swiftly arrest the suspect and recover suspected stolen property.

“Their quick thinking in alerting the police also meant that the risk to the people who'd clambered on board the vessel in the darkness was minimised."
