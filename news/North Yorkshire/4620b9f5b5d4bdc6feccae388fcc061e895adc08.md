****************************************************************************

North Yorkshire Police is appealing for the public’s help to locate missing 55 year-old York man, Nick Gunnell.

Mr Gunnell was last seen around 11.20am this morning (30 June 2020) at his home address on Holgate Road in York and is believed to have visited a business address on Oxford Street shortly afterwards. Officers are extremely concerned for Mr Gunnell’s welfare.

He is over 6ft tall, of a slim build with short, cropped grey hair. We believe Mr Gunnell may be wearing dark blue jeans, a blue v-neck jumper, a blue lightweight quilted jacket and blue shoes with a white sole. He may also be wearing a baseball cap with a Leeds logo on and is possibly carrying a backpack.

Anyone who has any information that could help to locate Mr Gunnell should call 999 for an immediate sighting or 101 with any other information quoting reference: 12200110795.
