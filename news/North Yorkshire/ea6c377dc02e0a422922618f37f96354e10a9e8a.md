North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a car which hit a man walking his dog and then failed to stop.

It happened on Saturday 14 December at 7.15pm on Royal Albert Drive, near to the Watermark Caf√©, in Scarborough.

From information already gathered, the man in his late 50s was crossing the road with his dog when he was hit by the car as it accelerated to overtake another car manoeuvring into a parking bay.

Ambulance services attended the scene and took the injured man to Scarborough General Hospital to be assessed for a spinal injury. The dog was unharmed.

We are appealing for witnesses to the collision or anyone who recalls seeing the vehicle prior to the collision, to get in touch as soon as possible to assist the investigation.

In particular, we are appealing for information about a Honda Civic which may have damage to its bumper or wing mirror.
