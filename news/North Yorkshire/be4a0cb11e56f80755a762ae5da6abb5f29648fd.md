Police are urging residents in rural areas to take extra steps to secure their heating oil, after a theft in Hambleton.

Between 8pm on Sunday 24 and 3pm on Monday 25 May 2020, oil was stolen from a tank at a property in the village of Thornton-le-Moor. Thieves are believed to have climbed over a fence before making off with about £250 worth of heating oil.

If you were in the area at the time, or have information that could assist the investigation, please call North Yorkshire Police on 101, quoting reference number 12200087186.

Inspector Matt Hagen, from North Yorkshire Police’s Rural Taskforce, said: “A domestic oil tank can contain many hundreds of pounds worth of oil, so our advice is take precautions to protect it.

“Measures such as remote oil level gauges, security lighting and a cage with a lockable access point can make a big difference.

“Consider also traditional security measures, such as planting prickly shrubs around the tank, investing in some high-quality locks, and installing a tank close to a house where it is overlooked by a window.

“While North Yorkshire is an extremely safe place, opportunist thieves will target isolated communities in rural areas. By keeping vigilant and increasing the security of your property, you can make a real difference in the fight against rural crime.”
