Police are appealing for witnesses after a fatal collision on the A165 Coastal Road near Burniston, Scarborough.

At about 10.45am on Sunday 13 September 2015, a blue Citroen Xsara Picasso travelling north along the A165 from the direction of Scarborough was in collision with a red Yamaha motorcycle, which was travelling in the same direction.

The pillion passenger on the motorcycle, a 44-year-old woman from Bury, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. The rider of the motorcycle, a man in his 40s was seriously injured, and remains in hospital. The driver of the car, a local man in his 40s, was uninjured.

Anyone who saw the collision, or either of the vehicles involved, is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police.

Police are particularly keen to speak to the driver of a maroon bus or van-type vehicle which passed the scene travelling southbound shortly before the collision occurred, as they may have important information that could assist the investigation.

Please dial 101, select option 2, and ask for TC Mark Hutchings or TC Andy Tucker in the Major Collision Investigation Team. Please quote reference number 12150161613.
