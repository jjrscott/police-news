Officers are appealing to these two men to come forward as they could have important information that could assist the investigation.

If you are the two men or know who they were, please contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for PC Michaela Godridge or email Michaela.Godridge@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
