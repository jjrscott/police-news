***UPDATE*** thank you to everyone who supported our appeal, Nicholas' family have now been traced.

Can you help the Coroner’s office find the next of kin of Nicholas George Douglas?

Sadly 51-year-old Nicholas was found dead at his home in Rowntree Avenue in York yesterday.

Officers have been unable to trace his next of kin and are appealing to family members or anyone who might have known Nicholas and can help locate his family, to contact them.

Anyone who can help is asked to call the Corner’s office on 01609 643181.

There are no suspicious circumstances surrounding Nicholas’s death.
