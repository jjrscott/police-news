Two men have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit theft, after police found a van with false number plates and tools inside.

Just before 1pm on Monday 11 May 2020, officers located a white van in suspicious circumstances parked on Hurricane Way, Sherburn-in-Elmet.

The area has in the past suffered from thefts from heavy goods vehicles.

Police detained a 31-year-old man nearby, and then found a 39-year-old man in the back of the van.

A search of the van, a white Ford Transit, located items including a large wrench and a crowbar. It also emerged that the van was displaying false plates, with the original plates for the van still inside the vehicle.

The van was seized for forensic analysis. Both men were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit theft, fraudulent use of a registration mark, and using a vehicle without insurance. They have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
