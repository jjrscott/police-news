Address in Huntington targeted three times by offenders.

The incidents happened at an address on Firwood Whin in Huntington on three separate occasions.

During the daytime on 7 November 2020, an old black boiler was taken from outside the property and following this, between 11.30am and 12.30pm on 8 November 2020, a white radiator and stainless steel sink were also taken from outside the property.

Between 11.30am on 11 November and 8am on 12 November, a locked garage was entered and four white radiators stolen, as well as an attempt being made to gain entry to the property through the front door. One of the stolen radiators is particularly distinctive as it is large and curved (see image).
