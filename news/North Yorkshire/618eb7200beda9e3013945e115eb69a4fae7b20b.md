North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a vehicle that was stolen from High Bentham.

Between 7.30pm on Saturday 14 January 2017 and 12pm on Sunday 15 January 2017 a red Mercedes van, registration number N612WPY, was stolen from a layby on the B6480 on the outskirts of High Bentham.

The vehicle is very distinctive as it is an old North Yorkshire Fire & Rescue vehicle. The signage has been painted over in red but is still visible underneath.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for PC 830 Barbara PARSONS. You can also email barbara.parsons@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12170008153.
