North Yorkshire Police are appealing for further information to determine the events which lead up to the death of 21-year-old Robert Stephenson in the early hours of 26 March 2016.

Mr Stephenson, from the Pickering area, died following a collision with a Ford Mondeo taxi on Micklegate in York at 2.30am on Sat 26 March 2016.

Police have analysed CCTV footage and are keen to identify two taxis which are seen in the area.

The first taxi they would like to identify is believed to be a silver Toyota Avensis which was travelling down Micklegate on its way into York City Centre. The silver vehicle is seen to stop next to Robert just prior to the collision, pause and then drive off into town.

The second taxi they would like to identify is a black Mercedes S-Class which was travelling up Micklegate out of York, directly behind the vehicle which collided with Robert.

Police are appealing for the drivers of these vehicles or anyone who could assist with the investigation to contact them on 101 and quote reference 12160052322.
