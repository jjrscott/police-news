Statement regarding the Mr O'Neill case

A North Yorkshire Police spokesperson said:

“The judge has made it very clear that he believes Mr O’ Neill poses a risk of sexual harm, and that it is right to have an order against him in place.

“It is of paramount importance for North Yorkshire Police to protect the public from the risk of sexual harm. We will work with the courts to agree suitable prohibitions that will protect the public from the risk Mr O’Neill poses. These prohibitions will be decided on 22 September 2016”.
