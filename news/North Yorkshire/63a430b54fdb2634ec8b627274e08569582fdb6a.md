The men’s health charity, Movember, has launched a new campaign called “Be a man of more words”.

It aims to encourage men to talk more openly about issues that affect their mental health before it develops into crisis.

It’s not always easy to reach out when things get tough, but meaningful conversations early on can reduce the risk of suicide.

More information is available on the website **www.movember.com/suicideprevention**.

This year, on World Suicide Prevention Day, Movember’s message comes straight from men who know better than anyone – watch the **Be a man of more words** video here:

To join the conversation on social media, use the hashtag **#WSPD2020**
