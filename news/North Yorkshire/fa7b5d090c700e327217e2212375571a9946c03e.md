At 12.30am Wednesday 21 June 2017, police received a call from a concerned member of the public regarding sightings of a suspicious vehicle at Snaygill Industrial Estate in Skipton.

A van had been seen driving around the industrial estate in a suspicious manner, without its headlights on.

Within minutes of the call, officers arrived at the industrial estate and following a search of the area, found that entry had been gained to one of the bike sheds, by the side panel of the shed being bent back and two mountains bikes had been stolen.
