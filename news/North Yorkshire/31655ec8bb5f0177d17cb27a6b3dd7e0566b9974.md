North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a burglary that occurred in Gargrave.

It happened on Skipton Road, Gargrave between 9am and 5pm on Thursday 6 December 2018. Offenders used a rock to smash a window to gain entry to the address after which an untidy search of the rooms inside was made.

We are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about any suspicious people or vehicles seen in or around the area at the time. Offenders are believed to have crossed the Cricket Field next to the main A65 so may well have had a vehicle parked nearby.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Rich Sutcliffe. You can also email richard.sutcliffe@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
