Three suspected shop thieves have been arrested within half an hour of leaving McArthurGlen in York with a haul of suspected stolen goods.

Police received a call from the designer outlet at 7.16pm on Tuesday 10 April 2018 to report the theft of sunglasses along with details of a vehicle the suspects were seen to leave in.

Officers were able to track the vehicleâ€™s movements thanks to Automatic Number Plate Recognition technology and located the vehicle travelling north along the A19 towards Thirsk.

At around 7.46pm, Roads Policing Officers intercepted the car and brought it to a stop on the A19 just outside Thirsk.

On searching the vehicle, officers found a substantial amount of other goods which they suspect have also been stolen from various shops in York. These have been seized and include two crates of champagne, 29 separate bottles of champagne, nine bottles of gin, two bottles of whisky, 28 packs of meat and a bag of clothing.

The three occupants of the vehicle, two men aged 44 and a woman aged 38 from Sunderland, were arrested on suspicion of theft from a shop and remain in police custody for questioning.
