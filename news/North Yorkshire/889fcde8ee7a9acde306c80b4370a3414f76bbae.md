North Yorkshire’s coroner’s office has issued an appeal to find the next of kin of 65-year-old Peter Cecil Wilkinson who died at his home in York last week.

Police were called to his home in George Court on 23 May 2019 after a concerned friend raised the alarm as they had not seen him for several days.

Sadly, Peter was found dead in his home. There are no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death.

Enquiries so far have not traced any of Peter’s next of kin. It is believed he previously worked at Nestle and was born in Gosforth, Tyne and Wear.

If you are a relative of Peter or know a member of his family, please contact the coroner’s office on 01609 643123.
