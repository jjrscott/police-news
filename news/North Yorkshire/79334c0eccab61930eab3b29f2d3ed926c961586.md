Officers are urging residents in York to be vigilant following a series of burglaries over the weekend.

Three properties in Thirkleby Way, Stray Road and Bedale Avenue, were targeted overnight Friday 21 October 2016 into Saturday 22 October 2016. Offenders gained entry to the garages at all of the properties, however there was no damage to the doors or locks.

Residents are urged to be vigilant and report any suspicious circumstances to the police. Officers also advise residents to check their garage and home security and consider secondary locks.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police. Dial 101, press 2 and ask to speak to DC Adam Saggers, or email adam.saggers@northyorkshire.pnn.police,uk.

Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.
