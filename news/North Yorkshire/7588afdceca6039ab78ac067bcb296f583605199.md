We are appealing on behalf of the Coroner’s Office to trace the family of Graham Freer, who lived at Croft Close, Easingwold.

Police attended Mr Freer’s address on Friday 5 June due to a welfare concern and sadly they found Mr Freer deceased. There are no suspicious circumstances.

It is believed that Mr Freer, who was born on 4 April 1947, has two sons - Roy Freer and Michael Victor Freer.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the Coroner’s Office on 01609 643123.
