Police are appealing for information to help identify the man in the e-fit.

Officers want to speak to the man in connection with a sexual assault which occurred on Friday 9 December in Stokesley.

The incident happened when a 19 year old woman from the Middlesbrough area was walking on her own along Leven Wynd at 11.30pm. A man grabbed the woman and sexually assaulted her before she managed to push him off. The man ran off towards Levenside.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or who saw the man in the area at the time is asked to contact police. In addition, if anyone thinks they know who the man is then they are urged to get in touch.

Dial 101, press 2 and ask to speak to PC1354 Steven Robinson, or email steven.robinson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
