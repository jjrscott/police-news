Thousands of people who are due to gather in Richmond and Catterick Garrison on Saturday (5 May 2018) for the start of the Third Stage of the Tour de Yorkshire will see a very special policing partnership on display.

North Yorkshire Police’s Neighbourhood Policing Team members will be carrying out foot patrols alongside colleagues from the Royal Military Police.

Commonly known as the “Red Caps”, the Royal Military Police have been longstanding close partners of North Yorkshire Police at Catterick Garrison and other military bases in the county.

There will be a large military presence in both towns as part of the official Tour de Yorkshire celebrations, including marching bands, demonstrations and military vehicles parading on the race route before the riders get underway.

**Superintendent Dave Hannan** of North Yorkshire Police, who is commanding the policing operation for Stage 3 of the event, said: “It is an absolute privilege to be working alongside our colleagues from the Royal Military Police for the Tour de Yorkshire.

“It is another opportunity to demonstrate the effective relationship and mutual respect that has been developed over many years between the forces.

“It is going to be a spectacular sight in Richmond and Catterick Garrison for this friendly and family-oriented event, and the many thousands of people in the crowds can enjoy the occasion knowing they have a very reassuring presence close by to keep them safe and secure.”
