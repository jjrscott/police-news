Officers are appealing to garages, body shops and mechanics that may have repaired a silver car with no rear bumper since Sunday, 6 January as part of their investigation into a serious collision.

At around 4.40pm on Sunday, 6 January a motorcyclist was travelling along the B1222 near Peckfield, Sherburn in Elmet when they were involved in a collision with a car at the junction with the A63. The car did not stop at the scene and officers are keen to trace the driver.

Officers believe the car is a silver saloon, possibly a VW or a Skoda, and it suffered severe rear bumper damage as a result of the collision.

The motorcyclist, a man in his 20s, received serious injuries which required hospital treatment but has since been released.

Officers are keen to speak with anyone who either witnessed the collision or who believes they may know the vehicle involved to contact them with information. Please call North Yorkshire Police on 101 and select option 1.

If you wish to provide information anonymously then this can be done by contacting the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
