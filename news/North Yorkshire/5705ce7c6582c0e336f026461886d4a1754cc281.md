Following an enforced break due to the coronavirus “lockdown”, we’re very pleased to announce that our Volunteer Police Cadet units are back up-and-running and they are on the look-out for new recruits for 2021.

North Yorkshire Police’s Citizens in Policing Team have been working hard to re-start the sessions in line with strict COVID-19 guidelines.

This has involved finding new and independent venues with sole use, so that they can keep the cadets and leaders as safe as possible during the pandemic.

The first group to return was the Scarborough Unit which is now running out of Cloughton and Burniston Village Hall at Burniston. Pictured below, they had their first session on Wednesday 23 September.

The Volunteer Police Cadets are part of a nationally-recognised police uniformed youth organisation which operates in most parts of the United Kingdom. The sessions promote a practical understanding of policing among **all** young people, as well as to encourage the spirit of adventure and good citizenship. For more information please go to **https://northyorkshire.police.uk/jobs/cadets/**.

If you are interested in becoming a Volunteer Police Cadet, please email **kathryn.bean@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk** to be put on a recruitment waiting list.
