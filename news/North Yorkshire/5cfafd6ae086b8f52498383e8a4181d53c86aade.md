North Yorkshire Police is working with the National Trust to investigate damage caused to Brimham Rocks.

At around 8.45pm on Friday, 1 June a group of five young people were seen pushing a rock at the top of one of the crags. This resulted in the rock falling from the crag causing damage to the crag face.

The damage this has caused is irreplaceable and it is now in a potentially dangerous condition. The incident has not only caused considerable damage to both the rock and the crag face, but those responsible also put themselves in danger and have created a potential hazard for other visitors to Brimham Rocks.

If you have any information about the identity of those responsible please contact officers on 101, choosing option 2 and quote reference 12180097959. Alternatively email bill.hickson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk.
