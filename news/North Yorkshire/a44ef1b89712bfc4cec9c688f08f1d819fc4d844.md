North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a theft from B&M; on Seamer Road.

The incident happened at the B&M store on Seamer Road, Scarborough at around 3pm on 1 March 2020 and where a variety of 'LOL DOLL' toys and accessories were stolen to the value of £341.77.

We are requesting the public’s assistance to help establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for anyone who might have been in the store or in the area of the store around the time of the theft. We are also looking to speak to a young female who was in the area at the time wearing dark ripped jeans and a coat with a fur-lined hood as we believe she may have information that could help with the investigation.

Anyone with information should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Alexander Warren. You can also email: Alexander.warren@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
