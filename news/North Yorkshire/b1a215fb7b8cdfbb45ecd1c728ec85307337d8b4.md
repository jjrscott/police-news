Police are urging witnesses to come forward after a serious road traffic collision on the A1 at Londonderry.

At around 1.15am on Monday 1 June 2015, a white Ford Fiesta collided with the central reservation on the southbound carriageway around half-a-mile south of the RAF Leeming flyover near junction 51.

The driver of the car, a 22-year-old man, sustained a head injury in the collision and was taken to James Cook Hospital for treatment, where he remains in a serious condition.

Officers are appealing to any witness to the collision to come forward. They are particularly keen to speak to anyone who saw the collision happen or saw the vehicle prior to the collision itself.

Even a small piece of information may be an important and could assist the investigation.

Anyone with information is urged to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101 - select option 2 - and ask for Traffic Constable Chris Coleman.

Alternatively, information can be emailed to chris.coleman@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

Please quote reference number 12150090556 when passing information about this incident.
