Damage to the Fiat 500's windscreen

North Yorkshire Police is appealing for information after a 22 year old woman suffered a minor head injury as a result of a road traffic collision on Studley Road, Ripon around 9.45pm on Wednesday 31 March 2021.

The incident occurred near to the River Laver Holiday Park and involved a grey Fiat 500 car and a van. The van, described as a drop-side van with a white cab and silver sides, failed to stop after the collision and continued driving towards Ripon city centre.

The female driver of the Fiat 500 suffered head injuries which are believed to have been caused by unsecured timber falling from the rear of the van onto the carâ€™s windscreen.

If you witnessed this incident or have any information which could help identify the van and its driver to help us establish the full circumstances of this incident then please contact Traffic Constable 174 David Minto, Roads Policing Group at david.minto@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk or 101 quoting reference 12210089276.
