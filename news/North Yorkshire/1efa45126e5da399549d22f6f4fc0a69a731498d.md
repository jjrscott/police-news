A historic ruin that inspired artists like J. M. W. Turner has become the victim of graffiti vandals.

Some time during the month of July, damage has been caused on the ruins at Easby Abbey, near Richmond. Graffiti has appeared at the site, which is likely to cost several hundred pounds to remove. The graffiti is a mess of colour, with no identifiable writing or tags.

Easby Abbey was founded in 1152 by Roald, Constable of Richmond Castle. Following its suppression in 1536, it was abandoned and most of its buildings stripped. Later, the picturesque ruins became a favourite subject for artists including J. M. W. Turner.

North Yorkshire Police's Rural Taskforce is appealing for anyone with information about who is responsible for the damage to get in touch. Please call 101, and quote reference number 12180147503, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: “North Yorkshire's rich heritage is a big part of the reason why it’s such a wonderful place to live and visit. Our Rural Taskforce is working with partner agencies and the wider community to protect sites of historical interest, so that others can continue to enjoy them for many years to come.

“Repairing the damage caused to heritage assets is expensive, and the cost to communities can often be immeasurable. If you have an interest in heritage, or live near a historical site, please keep an eye out, and report any suspicious activity to us on 101, or 999 if a crime is in progress.”
