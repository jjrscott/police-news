An 18-year-old man from Bradford currently remains in police custody, after being arrested on suspicion of going equipped for theft, after a barge was broken into at around 7pm, Tuesday 10 October 2017.

Officers were patrolling near the canal bank on Broughton Road, Skipton when their suspicions were raised by two men.

Officers stopped the men, however one resisted, which resulted in a officer being assaulted and the man running off. The other, an 18-year-old man from Bradford, was arrested and after conducting a search, he was found to be in possession of a number of suspected stolen items.

The 18-year-old man remains in police custody. Enquiries are ongoing to locate the second man who ran off.
