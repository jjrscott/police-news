Officers from teams across North Yorkshire Police will be joining up with numerous partner agencies for a day of action across Harrogate District.

Designed to offer opportunities for community engagement and to show proactive policing in action, Operation Culminate’s ultimate aim will be to reduce crime and anti-social behaviour and increase police intelligence and community confidence in the Harrogate District area.

Officers from the local Neighbourhood Policing Teams, Firearms Support Unit, Roads Policing Unit, Rural Task Force, Traffic Bureau, Specials, Volunteers and Police Staff are joining colleagues from British Transport Police, North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Services and the NHS and other agencies; all with the ultimate aim of making Harrogate District a safe place to live, work and visit.

The day of action will take place on Thursday 29 March 2018 and will involve high visibility patrols in known ASB hot spots, local area teams delivering crime prevention advice to householders, proactive patrols of the roads by Roads Policing Group officers, safety camera vans being deployed throughout the district and Community Speed Watch groups deploying in their local areas, to keep local roads safe.

British Transport Police will be carrying out engagement at key locations in Harrogate, ensuring commuters are safe on their journeys and North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue will join local area teams on patrol, to speak to local youths to deliver key safety messages around fire safety.

Speaking about the day of action, Inspector Chris Galley said:

“Operation Culminate has been developed and designed to bring together a number of strands of proactive work, involving our agency partners, into one day that is focused on displaying our joint commitment and intention to tackle a number of issues.

“Our aim is to provide reassurance and build confidence within our communities, whilst detecting, deterring and disrupting criminal activity.

“Harrogate District is already a great place to live, work and visit and by working together with our partners we are committed to ensuring it stays that way.”
