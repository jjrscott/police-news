Hampshire Constabulary is leading a joint investigation with Thames Valley Police into physical assaults against children in Banbury and Bristol, relating to circumcision procedures performed on boys at home.

Mohammad Siddiqui, aged 52, from Birmingham was arrested on Tuesday (July 3) on suspicion of grievous bodily harm.

Mr Siddiqui has been released from custody and remains under investigation.

An address has been searched in Birmingham.

Hampshire Constabulary Detective Chief Inspector Fiona Bitters said: “This is a large investigation and we are already speaking to a number of people in relation to these allegations, however we would like to speak to anyone who may have information that can help us with our investigation or is concerned about a procedure which has taken place privately since 2015.

“We are asking parents or guardians of boys circumcised, or healthcare workers, who have concerns about the procedure, the aftercare provided, or the recovery to come forward.

“We are not investigating the practice of circumcision, we are investigating if any criminality took place relating to an individual’s actions when undertaking this procedure or the aftercare provided.”

Anyone with information can report using the HOLMES National Police Portal https://mipp.police.uk/operation/826 . If this is not possible please call 101 and ask for Hampshire Constabulary quoting Operation Jetson. Alternatively please call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
