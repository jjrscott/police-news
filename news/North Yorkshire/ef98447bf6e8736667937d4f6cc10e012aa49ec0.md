North Yorkshire Police is receiving an increasing number of reports from residents falling victim to ‘ghost broking’ fraud in which car insurance is provided fraudulently by scammers.

Residents may receive correspondence from an insurance company, thanking them for insuring their vehicle with them but the resident receiving the correspondence does not own the vehicle or have any knowledge of it.

This could be because a fraudsters has used your address in order to obtain a better premium or it may be the type of fraud known as ‘ghost broking’.

‘Ghost brokers’ are scammers who offer car insurance that has been obtained fraudulently or using fake documents. Often the person purchasing the insurance is unaware they are a victim of this fraud until they try to claim on the policy.

Victims are sometimes sold fake insurance documents when the policy doesn’t actually exist and other times, a real policy is purchased but using false details to make the price lower.

So what should you do if you receive correspondence as described above, when you have no knowledge of the vehicle it refers to?

Report this and the vehicle details listed to North Yorkshire Police on 101.

And also report it to the Insurance Fraud Bureau online: https://insurancefraudbureau.org/cheatline/#
