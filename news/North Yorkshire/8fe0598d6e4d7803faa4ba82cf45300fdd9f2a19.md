A new project to tackle the negative impacts of excessive alcohol consumption will take to the streets of Selby on Friday night.

As part of the Alternate campaign, which promotes the aims of the North Yorkshire Alcohol Strategy, five films have been created to ask people to think differently about their drinking in the town.

From 6pm to 9pm on Friday 4 September, North Yorkshire Police officers will join partners from North Yorkshire Horizons at the Market Cross with a large video van to premi√®re the films, engage with the public, and promote the campaign's new websitewww.alternatedrinking.org.

The video launch follows an innovative research project in Selby earlier this year, which studied changes in drinking patterns and behaviours such as 'pre-loading', where alcohol is consumed at home before going out into town.

Inspector Ian Mcniff, of Selby Police, said: "The Alternate campaign promotes a simple message - we are asking people to think differently about their drinking. We want everyone on a night out to enjoy themselves, and stay safe.

"Everyone is welcome to come along and view the films and speak to staff on Friday night to find out more about the campaign."
