Police are appealing for information and witnesses after a man was injured in a collision involving a car and a cycle.

Between 9.50pm and 10.10pm on Thursday 17 March 2016, a 25-year-old man was cycling along Manor Drive North in Acomb, York, when he heard a car approaching from behind.

The car then took a left turn onto Malvern Avenue, knocking the cyclist off his bike, causing injuries to his face, hands, knees and groin, which required stitches.

The car involved is described as possibly a Ford Fiesta or Focus in either a green or blue colour. Its driver is described as a woman, possibly 30-40 years old, wearing glasses, with mousey brown or dark blonde hair that was shoulder-length with a box fringe.

Anyone who saw the collision, or has any information about the car involved, is asked to contact PC Carol Thompson of York Police - please dial 101 and select option 2, or email _carol.thompson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk_. Please quote reference number 12160047667.
