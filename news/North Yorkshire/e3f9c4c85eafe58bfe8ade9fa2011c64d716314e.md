Police are investigating after a cat died after being shot several times with an air rifle.

Oscar the cat made his way back to his home in Scagglethorpe near Malton after being repeatedly fired at.

His owner, who is too upset to be identified, noticed the wounds and took him to the vet.

The vet tried to save Oscar by amputating his leg and removing pellets from elsewhere in his body.

However, sadly he died from his injuries a day later.

The offence was reported to police on Tuesday 29 March 2016 although it is believed to have taken place a week earlier. However, the owner was too distraught to report it immediately.

PC Linda Coles, of Malton Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "This was a particularly cruel attack against an affectionate animal, and it has understandably left his owner heartbroken.

"I'd appeal for the public's help in finding whoever who did this, and we will do everything in our power to bring them to justice for this cowardly attack."

The motive behind this incident is not clear and police are appealing for anyone with information to get in touch. Please contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, ask for Linda Coles and quote reference 12160054750.
