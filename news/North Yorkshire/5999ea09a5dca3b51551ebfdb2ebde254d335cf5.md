Police are appealing for witnesses and information following a burglary from commercial premises in York.

Between 5pm on Friday 10 June and 8am on Monday 13 June, offenders have gained entry to a secure compound on Mill Lane, Askham Bryan, and stolen £50,000 - £60,000 worth of SNAP-ON tools and equipment.

Anyone who was in the area over the weekend and who may have seen any suspicious activity or vehicles is asked to contact the police.

Also, anyone with any information about people trying to sell Snap-On tools is urged to call police.

Dial 101, press 1 and pass information on to the force control room.

Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.
