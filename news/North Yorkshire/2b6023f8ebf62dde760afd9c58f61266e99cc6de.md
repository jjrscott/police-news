North Yorkshire Police have issued a further appeal for witnesses following a serious assault in Harrogate.

Police were called at about 1.50am on Sunday 11 October, to a report of a serious assault on Cheltenham Crescent, near the junction with Oxford Street, in Harrogate.

The victim, a man in his thirties, was taken to hospital with stab wounds to his back and arms. He has since been discharged from hospital.

A 41-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of wounding, and a 26-year-old woman arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. Both have been released on bail while the investigation continues.

A number of people were in the area at the time of the assault, and officers are keen to speak to anyone who was in the Cheltenham Crescent and Oxford Street area around that time.

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to contact the Harrogate Serious Crime Team by calling 101 and selecting option 2, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Please quote reference 12150180052 in connection with this incident.
