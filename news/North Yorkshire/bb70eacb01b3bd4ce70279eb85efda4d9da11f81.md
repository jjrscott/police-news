Police are appealing to witnesses following a collision involving a car and a child on a scooter.

At about 9am on Sunday 2 July, a 16-year-old boy was travelling on his scooter along Old Road into the village of Clapham.

Just prior to entering the village the child was struck by a silver or grey coloured Vauxhall Corsa leaving the village and travelling in the opposite direction towards Ingleton.

Although the child was thrown over the bonnet of the vehicle, sustaining leg injuries, the driver failed to stop.
