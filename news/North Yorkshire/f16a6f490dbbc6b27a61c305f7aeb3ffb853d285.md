Scarborough Volunteer Police Cadets raised £298.63 for the Alzheimer’s Society during last week’s National Volunteer Week (1 – 7 June 2017)

They raised the money by packing bags for shoppers in Sainsbury’s supermarket on Tuesday evening (6 June).

The cadets who are aged between 14 and 16, chose the charity after learning about dementia under the society’s Dementia Friends programme which has been adopted by North Yorkshire Police.

PC Tracey Brewster, one of the Scarborough unit’s leaders, said: “Our thanks go to the customers and staff of Sainsbury’s for their support and generosity. The cadets overwhelmingly voted to support the Alzheimer’s Society as their chosen charity, with many of them highlighting the Dementia Friends session they undertook as one of the stand-out moments of their cadet careers so far. They are an outstanding group of young people who should be very proud of themselves – I know we all are.”

Hannah Riley, local community fundraiser for Alzheimer’s Society, said: “Alzheimer’s Society are working to create a dementia friendly generation, and it is wonderful that the cadets were so inspired to take action and to raise vital funds for those affected by dementia. Dementia affects all of us, young or old, and we are calling on more groups of young people to unite with us and help to make a difference.”
