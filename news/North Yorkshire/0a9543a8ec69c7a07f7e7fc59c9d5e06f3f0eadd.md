UPDATE 2.40pm 20 July 2017 - all calls to 101 are now back to normal. Apologies for the inconvenience and thanks to all for their patience.

We are currently experiencing technical problems with some calls to our non-emergency line 101.

Not all calls are affected, but some callers may experience loss of sound from either end.

We will aim to call everyone back as soon as possible if they can't hear the call being answered or we can't hear the caller. If you do not hear from us within an hour of your call, please call back.

We are working with external service providers to rectify the problem.

We apologise for any inconvenience and thank you for your patience while the matter is resolved.

This only applies to calls to 101.
