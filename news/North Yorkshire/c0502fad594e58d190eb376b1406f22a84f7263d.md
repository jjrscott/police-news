Police are investigating after sheep were stolen from a farm near Ingleton.

20 Texel cross sheep were taken from a field near Far Westhouse, Ingleton, between 11 and 14 September 2015.

All the sheep had a red dot mark between the shoulder blades and were marked with the flock tag reference UK125254.

Details of the sheep have been circulated online and shared with partner organisations.

Earlier this month, North Yorkshire Police joined forces with the NFU to launch new specialist training in livestock theft. The initiative also sees officers using special evidence tags on any sheep stopped in transit and suspected of being stolen.
