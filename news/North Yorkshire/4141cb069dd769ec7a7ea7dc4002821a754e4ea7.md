Hundreds of young people in Craven have been given 'crucial' advice on staying safe, thanks to a long-running safety event.

Craven Crucial Crew, which has been running for 19 years, invites young people to attend 'hands-on' safety events, giving them a chance to experience potentially dangerous situations in a safe and supervised environment.

Over the last two weeks, from 19 April to 28 April 2016, 570 Year 6 students from schools in the Craven area have attended daily scenarios, learning about water safety, the consequences of crime and anti-social behaviour, fire safety, domestic abuse, autism, railway safety, safety in the countryside, advice about drugs, internet safety, gas safety and electricity safety.

The event took place at the Play Away Centre, Eshton Grange, Gargrave.

PCSO Jayne Grace, of North Yorkshire Police, said: "Crucial Crew gives young people an entertaining and informative day learning about how they can keep themselves safe, help others, and help make their local communities a safer place in which they live. It's an important message that they'll remember for the rest of their lives.

"I'd like to thank all the presenters for all their hard work and commitment at making Crucial Crew a great success."

The organisations that attended the event include:

 * North Yorkshire Police
 * North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service
 * North Yorkshire County Council
 * Craven District Council
 * IDAS, the domestic abuse charity
 * The Children's Society
 * Northern Gas
 * Northern Powergrid
 * Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority
 * Northern Rail
