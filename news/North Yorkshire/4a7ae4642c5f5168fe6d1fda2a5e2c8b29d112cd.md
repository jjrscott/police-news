The bravery of patrons at a Harrogate social club has been praised, after they restrained a weapon-wielding man.

On 25 February 2018, Malcolm Paul Johnson assaulted a customer in a social club on East Parade, Harrogate. He left, but later returned carrying an imitation firearm (an air pistol) and a machete.

A number of members of the public having a drink at the bar intervened and disarmed him, eventually managing to get him away and the victim to safety. North Yorkshire Police officers located Johnson and arrested him a short time later.

Johnson, 52, of Dragon Parade, Harrogate, pleaded guilty to drink driving, possession of an imitation firearm, possession of a knife in a public place, affray and assault.

On Friday 13 April 2018 at York Crown Court, he was jailed for a total of four years and banned from driving. The judge commended the patrons of the club for their bravery.

DC Rebecca Prentice, of North Yorkshire Police, said: “Members of the public displayed great courage in restraining Johnson, eventually managing to get him away and the victim to safety. They did this not knowing whether the gun was, in fact, real or not – putting themselves in potential danger to assist someone else.”
