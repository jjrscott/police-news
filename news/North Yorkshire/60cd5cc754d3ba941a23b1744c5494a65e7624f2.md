Police are trying to trace a woman who was knocked over backwards during an incident of disorder in York over the weekend.

Officers need to speak to the woman, who was knocked over backwards and appeared to bang her head, next to the main doors of Club Salvation, in George Hudson Street, at about 2am on Saturday 31 October 2015.

The woman was dressed in a white 'angel' outfit, and was helped up and comforted by a man in a 'skeleton' outfit.

A 20-year-old York man has received a caution for assault in connection with the incident.
