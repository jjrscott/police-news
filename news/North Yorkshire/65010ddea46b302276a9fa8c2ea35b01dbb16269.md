North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a fail to stop collision that occurred at Smallways A66 Motel.

It happened at approximately 9.50pm on the 14 April 2015, on the A66 heading east towards Scotch corner opposite the A66 Motel.

A small red car pulled out of the junction and failed to cross the carriage way causing a grey Landrover Defender to swerve, lose control and flip over onto its side. The driver of the red vehicle then made off from the scene heading south towards Newsham.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the public's assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about the red vehicle that failed to stop.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for Mark Price.

You can also email Mark.price@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
