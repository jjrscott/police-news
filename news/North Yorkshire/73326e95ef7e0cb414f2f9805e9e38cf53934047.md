Police in Skipton are hosting a crime prevention awareness event to encourage green-fingered residents to keep their allotments safe and secure.

Officers are working with Skipton Town Council to sow the crime prevention message at the Middletown Allotments on Friday 12 June 2015.

From 6pm to 7.30pm officers will be available at the East Castle Street entrance to answer common questions or discuss any allotment security issues. There will also be a 15-minute crime prevention talk at 6.30pm - anyone who would like to attend is welcome to bring along a deck chair or similar to sit on.

PCSO Amy Sharrad, of Skipton Police, said: "During the event we will be able to answer any questions allotment-holders may have regarding the security of their allotment, garden or shed."

The event will be hosted by PCSO Amy Sharrad, PCSO Ruth Pearson and PC Liz Rutter. For more information, contact Skipton Police by dialling 101 and select option 2.
