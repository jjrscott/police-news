Selby Police are appealing for information after 20 graffiti tags appeared in the town.

The tags appeared in the early hours of Saturday 16 January 2016, on Finkle Street, Micklegate, Millgate and Ousegate.

In particular, police want to speak to two men seen in the area at the time. They are described as aged between 16 and 19 years old. One was wearing a dark-coloured jacket and had short brown hair, spiky on top. The other man was shorter, wearing a dark-coloured jacket with a hood, skinny dark jeans and white trainers.

Some of the graffiti is offensive in nature. Inspector Michelle Falkingham, of Selby Police, said: "The offensive nature of this graffiti is wholly unacceptable, and has caused concern in the local community. An investigation is underway to identify those responsible, and I would urge anyone who has any information to contact the police."

__

Anyone with information about the graffiti is asked to contact Selby Police by calling 101, or Crimestoppers anonymously 0800 555 111, quoting reference 12160008871.
