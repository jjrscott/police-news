The family of a man who died last week following a collision on Marine Drive in Scarborough have paid tribute to a “much loved dad, brother, grandad, uncle and friend”.

He has been identified as 59 year-old Michael John Sanders from Brough with St Giles.

Michael’s family have provided the following tribute to him:

“Michael John Sanders gone too soon. He was a much loved dad, brother, grandad, uncle and friend. A great loss for everyone who was blessed to be part of his life.

“He will be sadly missed but we will see him again one day."

Police are continuing to appeal for anyone who witnessed the collision, or has any dash-cam footage, to come forward if they haven’t done so already.

The collision happened at around 4.45pm on Sunday 19 July on Scarborough’s Marine Drive and involved a black and orange Honda CBR motorcycle, which was being ridden by Mr Sanders, and a red Ford Transit van.

Mr Sanders was taken to hospital where he sadly died from his injuries.

Anyone who has any information that can assist the investigation is asked to email MCIT@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk or call North Yorkshire Police on 101 quoting reference number 12200123271.
