Officers are appealing for witnesses and dash-cam footage following an altercation between the rider of a motorcycle and the driver of a pick-up truck.

At around 5pm on Friday, 22 February the driver of a silver coloured Mercedes-Benz pick-up truck and the rider of a silver Yamaha motorcycle were travelling south on the B1365 from the direction of Hemlington, Middlesbrough towards Stokesley.

The incident began just after the village of Tanton and the junction with a minor road that leads to Great Ayton, known as Blackmore Road (which is just after the stone bridge) and continued to the area known locally as the 'Strikes Roundabout' before heading on the A172 and the A173 towards Easby.

Anyone who was in this area and either witnessed the manner of driving of the vehicle or caught footage on their dash-cam is urged to contact North Yorkshire Police quoting reference 12190033288.

Information can also be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
