A man who sexually assaulted a woman on Wooden Hill Lane in Romanby has been sentenced.

Connor Joseph Atkinson was made to sign on the sex offender’s register for five years and given a Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO) for ten years when he appeared at York Magistrates’ Court on Thursday 29 March.

The 19-year-old (pictured) approached the victim, who was in her 40s, and sexually touched her through her clothing as she was walking along the lane near kennels at the back of the football field.

The incident happened just after 7pm on the night of Sunday 13 August 2017.

North Yorkshire Police launched an investigation following the incident, including a public appeal for information and Atkinson was arrested on the same day of the incident.

He was charged with one count of sexual assault, which he pleaded guilty to.

Detective Constable Neil Brodhurst, of Northallerton Serious Crime Team, said:

“Atkinson has been convicted of this offence and I hope that his conviction shows how seriously this type of offence is treated and serves as a warning to others.

“I would like to thank the victim for her courage in coming forward to the police. With her support, our officers were able to quickly locate her attacker and build a case that led to him admitting the offence and being sentenced.”
