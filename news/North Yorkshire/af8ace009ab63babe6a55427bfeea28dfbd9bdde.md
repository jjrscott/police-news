North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information after jewellery was stolen.

The incident happened in Badger Gate, Threshfield at around 7.30pm on 16 December 2019 where a car parked outside the owner's address was entered and a supermarket insulated freezer type bag was stolen which contained various items of jewellery.

Police are appealing for information or witnesses to help establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for anyone locally who saw a man in dark clothing wearing a dark jacket with the hood up in or around this location at the time. After taking the bag from the vehicle he ran quickly out of Badger Gate and onto Wharfeside Avenue carrying the freezer bag. The area was very quiet at this time and his behaviour running quickly from the scene would have been unusual to see.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for PC 1728 Rich Sutcliffe. You can also email Richard.sutcliffe@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12190229907.
