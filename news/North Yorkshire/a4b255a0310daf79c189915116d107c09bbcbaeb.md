Officers are appealing for information to help identify the men in the CCTV images, following an incident at a Co-op in York.

**** It happened shortly before 6.15pm on Thursday 26 October 2017 when two men entered the Co-op on Tang Hall Lane together.

A man went to the meat aisle and proceeded to fill an ASDA carrier bag with beef joints more than fifty pounds. A female member of staff in her sixties challenged the man and picked up the ASDA bag which was on the floor. The man then grabbed the bag back from the member of staff and verbally threatened to stab her before running out of the store.

The other man picked up two bottles of Smirnoff Vodka worth nearly thirty pounds from a box on the shop floor and walked out of the store with the bottles without making any attempt to pay for the items.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police. Dial 101, press 2 and ask to speak to PC Kristoffer Griffiths or email Kristoffer.griffiths@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Please quote reference number 12170192451 when passing on any information.
