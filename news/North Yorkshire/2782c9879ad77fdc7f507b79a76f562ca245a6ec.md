At about 10.20pm on Saturday 26 November, a PCSO from North Yorkshire Police’s Rural Taskforce on patrol noticed a Ford Transit van behaving suspiciously in Kellington, near Selby. The vehicle was spotted again, in Selby town centre, at about midnight by North Yorkshire’s Police Road Crime Team, but it failed to stop when requested by officers.

It was then pursued by specialist North Yorkshire Police units for about 20 minutes, until it was brought to a stop near Darrington, near Pontefract.

Three men, aged 19, 22 and 28, all from Leeds, were arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle and going equipped for theft. The 19-year-old was also arrested on suspicion of drug driving, failing to stop, dangerous driving and driving without a licence and insurance. The van was seized, as were a number of tools found inside.

All three have been released on bail, with conditions not to enter North Yorkshire, as the investigation continues.
