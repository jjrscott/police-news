Today the Police and Crime Commissioners of South and North Yorkshire announced that Dave Jones, Chief Constable of North Yorkshire Police, will assume command of South Yorkshire Police for an interim period whilst a permanent Chief Constable is recruited.

For the period of this interim appointment, Deputy Chief Constable Tim Madgwick will become Acting Chief Constable at North Yorkshire Police.

Commenting on the announcement, Acting Chief Constable Madgwick said:

"It is right that the police service as a whole pulls together to support the situation in South Yorkshire, for the sake of the communities and the force.

"We are fully behind our Police and Crime Commissioner's decision to support South Yorkshire Police through this interim posting for our Chief Constable. It will be a challenging post, but from our experience of Dave Jones we know he will make a very professional and positive contribution.

"Meanwhile, we have a strong team in place here, and we will continue to work very hard to police North Yorkshire effectively, and to keep communities safe."
