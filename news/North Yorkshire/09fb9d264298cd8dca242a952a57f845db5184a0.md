Police investigating a series of incidents involving bogus tradesmen in York have issued efits of two men they want to talk to.

Two suspects involved are believed to have targeted elderly residents across the city. Extensive enquiries into the incidents are ongoing.

Anyone who recognises either of the men, or has any information about their activities, is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police.

Please dial 101, select option 2, and ask for DC Ian Richardson or the York Investigation Hub. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Please quote reference number 12160041609 when passing information.

Officers are continuing to advise residents not to be taken in by these men and not to answer their door to anyone they are not expecting.

Always check before you answer the door and use a door chain if you have one. Don't be afraid to say no to them.

If you are aware of any repairs that need doing, always contact a reputable tradesperson yourself, or seek help from your family, friends or neighbours.
