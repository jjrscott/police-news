Police have issued CCTV video of a man they would like to talk to in connection with the theft of high-value pairs of glasses in Harrogate.

On 29 September 2016, a man entered the Boots store in Cambridge Street, Harrogate.

He placed several pairs of glasses into a carrier bag, and left without making any attempt to pay.

A similar incident took place at the same shop on 2 September 2016.

Officers want to speak to the man pictured in this video, as he may have important information that could assist the investigation:

Anyone who recognises the man is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police. Please phone 101, select option 2 and ask for Adam Smith, or email adam.smith@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk. If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12160177414.
