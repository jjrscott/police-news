At about 6.35pm on Thursday 3 November 2016 a woman returned home and found the rear kitchen door wide open. Her husband had only just left the property five minutes earlier.

As she walked from the kitchen to the bottom of the stairs she found the man who brushed past her and left the property via the kitchen door.

Nothing appeared to have been stolen but a bedroom light had been left on by the offender suggesting he had been upstairs.

The suspect is described as being white, aged around 19 years old, 5ft 6ins tall, slim build, short brown hair with a pointy nose, a pale complexion and smelled of body odour. He was wearing dark clothing at the time.

Anyone who recognises the man in the efit, or who has any information about the incident, is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police by calling 101. Please select option 2 and ask for PC Rob Spalding or Thirsk Police or Robert.Spalding@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
