Communities in York will be brought together thanks to local police officers – and the ‘beautiful game’.

North Yorkshire Police are working with York City Football Club Foundation and PlayFootball to engage different local communities in a football tournament later this year.

On Sunday 3 September, a seven-a-side football tournament will take place at PlayFootball pitch on Stirling Road, Clifton Moor. The aim is for community groups, including young people and minority groups, to put forward teams to take part in the event.

The tournament will run from 10am and 2pm, and 12 teams of seven players are required. Food and drink will be available, and there will be music from local bands.

PCSO Jamie Gibson, of York Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: “This tournament is a great opportunity for everyone to join in and have fun – but just as importantly, it will raise awareness of the different communities in York and North Yorkshire, and help bring them even closer together. I’d urge anyone who’d like to join in to get in touch – please email at rachel.simpson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk to get signed up.”
