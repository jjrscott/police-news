All incidents are currently under investigation.

North Yorkshire Police and the Army are carrying out extra reassurance patrols in the area and officers are asking residents to be vigilant and if they have to leave their property for any reason, to make sure it is secured and valuables are removed.

Acting Superintendent Mark Grange of North Yorkshire Police, said: "We have seen the best of human nature over these past few days, and the now the worst. I would like to reiterate my message to those who choose to add further misery to residents who have already suffered, North Yorkshire Police is doing everything possible to bring you to justice and make no mistake, you will face the full force of the law.

"I want to take this opportunity to remind residents to be vigilant and ensure property is as secure as it possibly can be, especially if they are not staying overnight."
