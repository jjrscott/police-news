Another great day in Harrogate as the UCI Championships got underway with the Team Time Trial Mixed Relay.

Although the weather wasn't as good as yesterday, the drizzle didn't dampen the spirits of everyone who turned out to cheer on the riders along the route and watch all the action unfold on the big screen in the fan zone.

Well done to the Great Britain team who took the bronze medal position.

Once again our officers were out and about around Harrogate, making sure everyone was safe and sound and interacting with the public.

Chief Inspector Charlotte Bloxham said: "For the second day in a row we had no serious incidents. Despite the damp weather, the public again turned up in large numbers and I would like to thank everyone for their impeccable behaviour. Here's to the next seven days."

Our web page northyorkshire.police.uk/lxuyhxzj has more information on how we are keeping you safe and sound during the championships, with links to day by day race information and road closures.
