Police are appealing for information after two masked men broke into a property on North Road in Stokesley and stole £320 in cash and bank cards, whilst the elderly homeowner was at home.

At around 1.15am on Wednesday 22 November 2017, the victim was reading in bed, when two men wearing face masks entered her home via a rear door.

After making an untidy search of the house, the two men moved onto the homeowners bedroom. As she attempted to call 999, one of the men grabbed the phone from her hand.

The elderly victim managed to get out of the bedroom and make her escape from the front door of her home and raise the alarm with a neighbour.

She was unhurt, but left very shaken and has required medical treatment since the incident.

Investigating officer DC Catherine Skelton said “This is a cruel and cowardly crime which has left the elderly homeowner in a very distressed state. If anyone has any information which could assist the investigation, I appeal to them to come forward and share it with us.”

Police are requesting that anyone who was in the area at the time, who saw anything suspicious, or has any information which could assist the investigation to contact them.

Please dial 101, select option 2 and ask to speak to DC Catherine Skelton from the Northallerton Serious Crime Team. Please quote reference 12170209479. Alternatively you can email Catherine.Skelton@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.
