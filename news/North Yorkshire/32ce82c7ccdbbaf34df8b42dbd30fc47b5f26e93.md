A new campaign will give youngsters at a Scarborough school advice on how to respect their community, through interactive workshops delivered by police and community safety officers.

he Respect campaign will be delivered at Barrowcliff School, Scarborough, throughout the week beginning Monday 16 May 2016.

The multi-agency project will highlight and tackle issues within the community which have been raised by local residents and children, through workshops led by a variety of local agencies.

The workshops will focus on:
• Neighbourhood and environmental issues (e.g. anti-social behaviour; noise nuisance; dog fouling; litter)
• Multi-culturalism (e.g. anti-racism and embracing differences)
• Road safety (e.g. careful crossing on the roads; Be Safe, Be Seen)
• Emergency services (e.g. the roles of police and fire officers; hoax calling)
• Internet safety (e.g. cyber-bullying; using the internet respectfully; who can help if things go wrong)

The final workshop will work towards large wooden lettering spelling RESPECT, designed and created by the children - one letter per year group. The finished product will be hung at various locations on the estate, to promote respect and act as a visual reminder of the young people's work carried out during the campaign.

The week will culminate in a 'sharing assembly' on Friday 20 May, and will see the introduction of 'Respect Ambassadors' within the school, nominated each term by young people themselves.

The agencies involved in the Respect campaign are North Yorkshire Police, Scarborough Borough Council (Community Safety Officer), North Yorkshire County Council (Community Cohesion Worker, Prevention Services and Road Safety Officer) and Yorkshire Coast Homes, all working in partnership to cover a wide range of topics using skills and expertise from the most appropriate organisation.

The Respect campaign secured funding from the "Barrowcliff Big Local" Small Grant Scheme. The money has been used to purchase, arts and crafts equipment, lanyards, costumes and props.
