Police are appealing for witnesses to a serious road traffic collision that occurred on the A66 near the Fox Hall Inn, Ravensworth.

At 12.30pm, Friday 19 May 2017 a lorry tanker travelling eastbound was involved in a collision with a green Skoda Yeti outside the Fox Hall Inn.

As a result of the collision the car struck an electricity pole, bringing power cables down across the road. The lorry had been carrying corrosive chemicals but was nominally empty.

The two occupants of the car, a 59-year-old man and a 60-year-old woman from the Worksop area, were taken to James Cook hospital with serious life changing injuries.

The tanker driver, from Hartlepool was not injured in the incident, but left very shaken.

A third vehicle was damaged by debris from the collision.

As a result of the collision the A66 was closed to allow the police to carry out a full investigation, to establish the cause of the collision and to allow the power lines, which had been brought down to be reinstalled.

Anyone who was travelling along the A66 who witnessed the collision, or anyone with information which could assist the investigation is asked to contact TC Martin Usher on 101 or email Martin.Usher@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
