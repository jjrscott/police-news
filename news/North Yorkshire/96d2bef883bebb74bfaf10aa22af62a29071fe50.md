Police in York have arrested two people after a laser was shone at a police helicopter during a search for a missing man.

At around 2.45am on 26 September 2018, The National Police Air Service, based in West Yorkshire, were assisting North Yorkshire Police with the search for missing Stuart Aiken from York when the laser was shone at the aircraft from the area of Ouse Bridge.

Officers in the helicopter guided officers on the ground to two suspects, a man aged 46 and a woman aged 29, who were arrested on the bridge on suspicion of endangering an aircraft. The two, who are of no fixed address, remain in police custody for questioning.

Inspector Andy Godfrey of York Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: " It goes without saying how dangerous it is to distract or try to blind a aircraft pilot. The consequences could have been catastrophic for the crew and members of the public on the ground."

Stuart has since been found in the Osbaldwick Link Road area of York and is receiving appropriate medical treatment.
