North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about an incident of hate crime that occurred in York.

It happened at around 5.45pm on 27 February 2019 the victim, a woman in her twenties, was walking through the two sets of doors of the main entrance to the Pear Tree Farm restaurant, Monks Cross Drive, York.

An unknown man, also going through the entrance doors, began to verbally abuse the victim in an aggressive tone, causing significant fear, alarm and distress to both the victim and the patient she was caring for who was in a wheelchair. The unknown man then proceeded to follow the victim to her car, which heightened her fear.

We are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

Anyone who was in the restaurant at the time of the incident is asked to contact police.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for Chris Dalby. You can also email chris.dalby@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
