A retired Greater Manchester police officer who stole more than £90,000 from St Robert’s Church in Harrogate, has been ordered to pay the money back by a Judge at York Crown Court.

Peter McNamara, 71, from Asenby near Thirsk, worked as an administrator at the church and the attached conference centre between May 2007 and October 2014. He is currently serving a two year prison sentence after being found guilty of two counts of theft at York Crown Court in October 2018.

He appeared in court last week under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and was told he would have to pay back a total of £103,711.56 to the Diocese of Leeds.

A/DI Jonathan Rowland, of the force's Economic Crime Unit, said: “Whilst securing a conviction and sentence is vital in these cases, so is the follow up work that goes on after criminal court proceedings. North Yorkshire Police, wherever possible, will seek to use available legislation in order to redress the financial damage done to a victim.

“The order placed on Peter McNamara, will ensure he is prevented from having any financial gain from his shocking crime of stealing form the local church. If he fails to pay what he owes, he will once again be put before the courts.

“The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 is a powerful tool which allows us to demonstrate to the court how a convicted criminal has benefited financially from their crime, and then ask the court to order the money is paid back. Our Financial Investigators work hard to ensure that in every case where it is possible for money to be paid back, it is put before a Judge for consideration.”
