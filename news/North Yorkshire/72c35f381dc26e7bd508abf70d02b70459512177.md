A man has been jailed for 18 weeks after he stole cycles worth thousands of pounds in the Hambleton area.

Craig Evans, 31, of Hazel Court, Middlesbrough, pleaded guilty to cycle theft and handling stolen goods at Northallerton Magistrates Court yesterday (Tuesday 3 February).

Evans targeted cycles left insecure in Stokesley and Great Ayton - propped up outside a café, and in one case on a park bench right next to where the victim was sitting.

In a three-week period from mid-July to August 2014 he stole:

 * A Scott Foil cycle worth £3,000 in Stokesley
 * A Cube Analog cycle worth £800 in Great Ayton
 * A Giant Anthem cycle worth £1,800 in Great Ayton

He also admitted handling a stolen Carrera Kraken mountain bike, worth £600.

Evans advertised the stolen cycles on online classifieds websites at a fraction of their price.

PC Alastair Gill, of Stokesley Police, said: "This case shows that we will not tolerate travelling criminals coming into North Yorkshire intent on committing crime, and ruining local residents' quality of life. If they do, be in no doubt, they will be pursued, identified and arrested."
