North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information after an incident involving two vehicles in Farnham near Knaresborough. The vehicles have then been involved in a collision and a man has had a substance thrown in his face requiring hospital treatment.

It happened on Farnham Lane between 4.20pm and 4.40pm on Wednesday 25 July 2018 and involved four males who were possibly in a dark blue Mazda vehicle.

This vehicle is alleged to have pursued a grey/black Peugeot Bipper van and caused a collision with it, before a substance has been thrown into the driver's face. The victim was treated at Harrogate hospital.

We are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information from anyone who was travelling in this area at the time and may have seen either of these vehicles driving in an erratic matter or involved in a collision or may have dash cam footage of these vehicles.

We are particularly keen to trace the driver of a white Volvo and a truck driver who may have been involved in near-misses with these vehicles.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, quoting reference 12180136103

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
