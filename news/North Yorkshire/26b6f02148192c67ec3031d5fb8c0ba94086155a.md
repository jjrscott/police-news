At 6.10pm on Monday 7 November 2016, a collision occurred between an elderly pedestrian and a black BMW 1 series on Levenside, Great Ayton.

The pedestrian, 80 year old Edward Roy Sarbutts from Great Ayton, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

Extensive enquiries into the incident have revealed that there were two vehicles travelling in front of the BMW prior to the collision. The drivers of these vehicles will almost certainly have seen Mr Sarbutts to their right. Officers urge the driver of these vehicles to get in touch.

The driver of the BMW, a 21 year old man, remains on police bail whilst enquiries continue.

Anyone who witnessed the collision or who has any information is asked to contact police. Dial 101, press 2 and ask for TS Hamish Halloway or email MCIT@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
