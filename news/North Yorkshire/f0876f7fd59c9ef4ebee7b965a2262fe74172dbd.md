Earlier today, a North Yorkshire Police disciplinary hearing found that the actions of PC 1347, Simon Ryan, amounted to gross misconduct and he was dismissed from the Force.

In accordance with national regulations introduced in May 2015, the hearing had an independent Chair, and members of the public and the media were able to attend.

Commenting on the decision of the panel, Acting Deputy Chief Constable, Paul Kennedy, said: "As a whole, North Yorkshire Police personnel are rated very highly by the public for the standards of service they provide, and for operating in a fair and respectful way. So it is very disappointing when an individual officer acts in a manner that is not up to the high standards that the public have come to expect.

"There will be some people who view the officer's actions as an ill-judged joke, but when an officer's honesty and integrity are called into question it is not a laughing matter.

"We respect the decision of the panel and the independent Chair, and the officer has consequently been dismissed from North Yorkshire Police."
