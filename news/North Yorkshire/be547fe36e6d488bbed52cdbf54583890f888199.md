Coaches belonging to Morse Coaches, based in Sheriff Hutton and serving much of York and Ryedale, have recently sustained a bout of damage and vandalism whilst being used by local schools.

During the last few weeks of the winter term, the company has had several of their buses damaged by school children from some of the area's secondary schools.

This has included graffiti on windows and seats, some of which is offensive, as well as damage to seats.

PC Alan Robson, of the Malton Neighbourhood Policing Team , said: "Damage to property is treated seriously by the police, the coach company and the schools involved, and we all are working together to identify those responsible.

"We are very lucky to live in an area of the country with a low level of crime and a high level of respect for fellow residents.

"This behaviour will not be accepted and anyone with information regarding those responsible is urged to come forward as soon as possible."
