Police are appealing for witnesses after a sneak-in burglary at Great Smeaton.

At sometime between 12pm and 3pm on Thursday 7 May 2015, thieves entered an elderly woman's home through an insecure door.

The victim, aged 91 who was at home at the time, later discovered that a gold caterpillar with ruby eyes was stolen. The item was awarded to soldiers who jumped from disabled planes in World War Two.

Some cash was also stolen in the burglary.

Officers are appealing to anyone who saw anything suspicious in the Great Smeaton area around the time of the incident to get in touch.

Anyone who can help officers with their enquiries is urged to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101 - select option 2 - and ask for PC Neil Brodhurst.

Alternatively, information can be emailed to neil.brodhurst@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you prefer not to give your name, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Please quote reference number 12150075324 when passing information about this incident.
