Police are appealing for information about the burglary of a property on Byland Road in Coxwold, near York.

They would particularly like to speak to anyone in the area with CCTV, who may have captured footage of any suspicious behaviour in the village at the time of the burglary.

At around 3.10am Saturday 20 January 2018, thieves broke into a house on Byland Road and stole a number of items including a laptop, an amount of foreign currency and passports. It is also thought that thieves attempted to steal the homeowners car, but were unsuccessful.

A person wearing light coloured clothing was seen to make off in the direction of Byland Abbey, towards a waiting car.

Detectives are keen to speak to any home or business owners in the area who have CCTV, who may have recorded footage of the thieves or the vehicle.

They would also like to speak to any foreign exchange desks or travel agents, who may have been approached by people attempting to change currencies relating to Indonesia, India and Laos.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police on 101, select option 2 and ask to speak to Gary SmithOwen of Northallerton Investigation Hub. You can also email Gary.SmithOwen@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
