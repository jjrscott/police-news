A Scarborough man who shouted, swore and threatened police officers has pleaded guilty to a public order offence in court.

On 5 April 2019 at 6.30pm, Adrian Charles Norman, 56, was arrested after officers attended a separate incident at an address in Woodland Avenue, Scarborough.

He was taken to custody, and subsequently charged with using threatening words towards two North Yorkshire Police officers with intent to cause fear of violence â€“ a public order offence.

Norman, of Woodland Avenue, appeared at Scarborough Magistrates Court on Friday 5 July 2019, where he pleaded guilty. Magistrates deferred his sentence until 5 December 2019 at the same court, with the expectation that he keeps out of trouble and pays existing court fines in the meantime.
