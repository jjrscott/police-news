Police have stepped up patrols in Harrogate, after a man exposed himself in two incidents in the borough.

On Wednesday 15 June 2016, a man exposed himself to a mother and child cycling along the Bilton to Ripley cycle path in Harrogate, at about 7.10pm. The woman shouted at him and he ran away.

On Thursday 23 June 2016, a man exposed himself to a different woman on Nidderdale Greenway, a remote part of Nidd Gorge, near Scotton, Knaresborough, at about 4pm. She shouted at him and he walked off.

Based on descriptions provided by the victims, it is believed that the two incidents are connected.

Inspector Penny Taylor, of Harrogate Police, said: “These are both very disturbing incidents, which are totally unacceptable. We are treating them extremely seriously, and are increasing patrols in the area. Please be reassured that we are doing everything we can to find this man.

“I would like to appeal for any witnesses, or anyone with information that would help us to identify the man responsible. I am also asking for anyone to come forward if they have been a victim of a similar incident and not yet reported it to the police.”
