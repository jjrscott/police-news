North Yorkshire Police has issued an update about the fatal collision in Scarborough today where those who stopped to help were initially asked to isolate due to a coronavirus link.

The accident happened at about 11.45am today (Sunday 31 January) at the junction of College Lane and Filey Road in Scarborough.

Sadly, the driver of the car was taken to hospital where he died.

In the earlier appeal, police explained that someone at the scene had tested positive for coronavirus and that those who stopped to help would therefore need to isolate.

Following further enquiries, it has now emerged that the person who had tested positive for coronavirus did so on 6 January and therefore those people who came into contact with them do not need to isolate as previously thought.

A spokesperson said: "Our thanks once again to those who stopped to help and our apologies for any confusion this may have caused.

"Please can we ask that you avoid any unhelpful speculation that may add to the distress of the manâ€™s loved ones. Our thoughts are with them at this very sad time."

Anyone who saw what happened or has any information is asked to call 101 or email the Major Collision Investigation Team at MCIT@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk quoting reference number 12210049306
