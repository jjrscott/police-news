A new puppy has joined North Yorkshire Police and begun the process which could see her one day qualify as a fully-fledged police dog.

The four-month old Belgian Malinois joined the force a few weeks ago - and has been named 'Diesel' in honour of the police dog killed in Paris last month.

She has been assigned to a volunteer puppy walker who will care for her, and ensure she gains experience of a variety of situations, including socialising with people and other animals, busy traffic, crowds of people and loud noises.

Such exposure at an early stage is vital for her to progress through to her basic training, and ultimately become a General Purpose Police Dog.

Sergeant Simon Whitby, of the North Yorkshire Police Dog Section, said: "The name Diesel was chosen out of respect for the police dog that died in a raid on an apartment block in Saint Denis, Paris, in November. The death touched us all, and having the name live on is a wonderful way to respect Diesel's memory."

As she grows and throughout her training period, Diesel will be continually assessed for her temperament, personality and suitability as a police dog.
