The men, aged 49 and 31, are due to appear in front of Scarborough magistrates at a later date.

**Original post 30/09/2020 - 10am:** Two suspected vehicle thieves are in custody after two men were seen trying the doors of parked vehicles in Scarborough last night.

At around 11.15pm on 29 September, police were alerted when a member of the public heard someone in their garden trying to break the lock of their motorcycle.

The men left the scene without the bike, but were then seen trying the door handles of parked vehicles as they made their way along Trafalgar Road towards North Marine Road.

Thanks to a combination of information from the public and CCTV operators, officers arrested the pair 15 minutes later on North Marine Road .

The men, aged 49 and 31 were arrested on suspicion of attempted vehicle theft and remain in custody at this time.

Police urge members of the public to be vigilant, make life hard for would-be thieves by taking as many crime prevention measures as possible.
