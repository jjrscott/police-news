Police are appealing for witnesses to a serious collision, which occurred at 4pm Friday 7 August 2020 on the A171.

A black Audi A4, which was travelling towards Whitby and a red Ford Fiesta, travelling toward Scarborough collided near to the turning for Robin Hood's Bay.

Two adults and two children travelling in the Fiesta were transported to hospital by land ambulance and a third child was airlifted to James Cook Hospital by Yorkshire Air Ambulance. The occupants of the Audi received minor injuries. The road was closed until 7pm, to allow emergency services treat the casualties and the scene to be investigated.

Officers are asking any witnesses to the collision or anyone who saw either vehicle prior to it, who did not speak to them at the scene, to contact them. They would particularly like to speak to anyone who captured dashcam footage of the vehicles or the collision itself.

Anyone with information which would assist the investigation is asked to dial 101, selection option 2 and ask to speak to Traffic Constable Mark Patterson or Traffic Constable Michael Rowan. You can also email Mark.Patterson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk or Michael.Rowan465@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
