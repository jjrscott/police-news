Four people have been arrested on suspicion of shoplifting offences, after being challenged by a security guard and later caught by police as they left North Yorkshire.

At about 12.40pm on Sunday 30 July 2017, a group of people were approached by store security in Debenhams at Monks Cross, York. The group dropped some items of clothing and made off from the shop in a blue Citroen C3.

Details of the vehicle were passed to North Yorkshire Police Roads Policing Group patrols, and it was spotted heading west on the A64 and stopped just after 1.30pm.

Four people in the car, two men aged 35 and 61, and two women aged 23 and 32, all from the Leeds area, were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to steal from a shop. They have been released under investigation while enquiries continue.
