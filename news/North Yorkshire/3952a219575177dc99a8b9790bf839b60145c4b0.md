Police investigating a three-vehicle collision near Harrogate are appealing for a driver to come forward who did not stop at the scene.

The collision occurred on the A661 at Plompton, close to Plumpton Rocks, at around 7am on Monday 4 February 2019.

It involved a silver Skoda Octavia, a silver Mercedes CLA 220d AMG and an unknown vehicle.

The Skoda was travelling towards Spofforth from Harrogate when it struck the oncoming unknown vehicle. This caused the Skoda to lose control and it collided with the Mercedes, which was heading towards Harrogate, further down the road.

Both the driver of the Skoda and Mercedes suffered minor injuries.

The unknown vehicle which did not stop will have sustained damage to its offside (or driverâ€™s side), specifically to the offside wing mirror area.

We are seeking witnesses to this collision. Can you recall seeing what happened? Have you observed someone that same morning whose vehicle was sporting fresh damage to its offside wing mirror? Do you have any dash-cam footage that could assist the investigation?

If you can help, please call North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for David Minto. Or email david.minto@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk. Please quote reference number 12190020972 when providing details about this incident.
