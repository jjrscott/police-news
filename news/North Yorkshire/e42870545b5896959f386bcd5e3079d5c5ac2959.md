We are now in a position to provide an update in relation to the incident at Lightwater Valley Theme Park near Ripon on 30 May 2019 involving a seven-year-old boy.

To clarify, the injured boyâ€™s age is seven, not six as previously believed.

The boy was taken by air ambulance to Leeds General Infirmary after an incident at Lightwater Valley on Thursday 30 May 2019.

On arrival at hospital, the child was assessed and found to have injuries that would not have been apparent at the scene of the incident.

The child remains in a critical but stable condition in hospital.

Although this is a joint investigation by North Yorkshire Police and The Health and Safety Executive, the HSE currently has primacy.
