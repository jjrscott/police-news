North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a fatal four-vehicle collision at the Fox Lane junction just north of Chapel Haddlesey on Friday 9 December.

It happened at approximately 6.20pm and involved a grey Citroen C1 car, a grey Ford Ranger pick-up truck, a grey VW Jetta car, and a blue Honda motorcycle.

Sadly, the 24-year-old man riding the motorcycle, who is from the Goole area, was pronounced dead at the scene.

We are appealing for witnesses to the collision, or anyone who recalls seeing any of the vehicles involved prior to the incident, to come forward as soon as possible.

This includes any motorists who came across the collision scene after it occurred, but did not stay to speak with the police.
