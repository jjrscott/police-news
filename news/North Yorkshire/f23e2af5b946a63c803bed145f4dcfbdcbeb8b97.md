Officers are appealing for witnesses to a near-miss head-on collision involving two police vehicles and a blue Suzuki Swift.

Officers are appealing for witnesses to a near-miss head-on collision involving two police vehicles and a blue Suzuki Swift.

The two marked police vehicles were travelling from Scarborough to attend an incident in Filey along the A165 at around 12pm on Monday, 5 November.

After the vehicles had passed the SPAR Petrol Station in Lebberston they were involved in a near-miss with a car travelling in the opposite direction. Fortunately, the vehicles did not collide and no injuries were reported. One of the vehicles then continued to make their way to the incident which they were originally called to.

A 19-year-old woman has been interviewed in connection with the incident and is currently assisting officers with their enquiries.
