Two members of the public have been praised by North Yorkshire Police after rescuing an 86-year-old man from his car that had entered the River Nidd in Knaresborough.

Emergency services were called at around 10.35am on Saturday 6 August 2016 after a member of the public saw the Mercedes enter the river from Conyngham Hall’s car park.

Two men (and a dog) rushed into the water and rescued the man from his submerged vehicle before handing him over to ambulance staff.

The driver, who is from the Wakefield area, suffered cuts and grazes and was taken to hospital for checks, but was otherwise unhurt.

Inspector Clive Turner of North Yorkshire Police praised the two men who went to the man’s aid. He said: “There is no doubt that the men who came to the rescue have saved the man’s life. The vehicle ended up completely submerged and without their quick thinking and very brave actions, the outcome could have been tragic. Rivers are dangerous bodies of water and the two men risked their own lives in the process. We extend a very big thank you to them, they should be extremely proud of what they have done.”
