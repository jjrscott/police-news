Thanks to everyone who shared our appeal, we have now located the family of York man, William (Bill) Douglas.

William was found dead at his home on 17 October after a concerned neighbour raised the alarm as they had not seen him for a few days.

Officers have not been able to trace any next of kin for William and are appealing to anyone who has information that could help find them.

If you knew him or can help trace his family or next of kin, please contact the coroner's office on 01609 643614 or email coronersyork@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

Williamâ€™s death is not being treated as suspicious.
