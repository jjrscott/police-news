Specialist public protection officers from Scarborough have brought a registered sex offender to justice.

Samuel Richard Thompson, aged 26, of the town’s Falsgrave Road, pleaded guilty to all 10 charges at Harrogate Magistrates’ Court on Friday (19 February 2021).

The offences included five Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO) breaches and five Sex Offender Notification (SON) breaches.

These were imposed by York Crown Court in April 2018 after he was convicted and handed a 24-month suspended prison sentence for causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.

However, an initial failure to notify offence led to further admissions by Thompson.

Digital evidence was then gathered which showed Thompson had further breached these measures which are designed to deter and detect reoffending. This includes the monitoring of online activity and ensuring browsing history is retained.

He was arrested on Wednesday (17 February 2021) and charged to court the following day.

The SHPO breaches involved Thompson deleting the Kik, Tinder and Whisper apps from his mobile phone, and deleting two chat histories on WhatsApp with unknown females which were of a sexual nature.

The SON breaches consisted of him failing to notify the police about new profile and usernames within three days on Snapchat, the No Mad gaming platform, the Only Fans social media platform, and on the Whisper and Kik social and dating apps.

Thompson has been remanded in custody and he will be sentenced at York Crown Court on 12 March 2021.
