North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a burglary that occurred on Cromwell Terrace in Scarborough.

The burglary happened at a flat on Cromwell Terrace in Scarborough between 7.30pm and 11pm on Friday 25 September 2015 when burglars entered the flat by smashing the door and searched through the property.

The occupant was not at home at the time and officers were alerted by a neighbour. At this stage it is unclear what has been taken, however substantial damage was caused to the door.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the public's assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for DC 877 Millington in Scarborough Investigation Hub. You can also email Vicky.Millington@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
