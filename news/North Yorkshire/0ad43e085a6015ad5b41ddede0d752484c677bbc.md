Police are appealing for information and witnesses after a burglary in Skipton.

Sometime between 8.30am and 4.45pm on Tuesday 3 May 2016, a house in the Gainsborough Court area of the town was broken into, and a number of items were stolen.

We are conducting enquiries and are appealing for anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area, or has any information about the incident to get in touch.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for DC Paul Smith or the Harrogate Investigation Hub. If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
