North Yorkshire Police is recruiting to fill a range of posts to help prevent accidents and save lives on North Yorkshire's 6,000 miles of roads.

The Traffic Bureau is looking to recruit Safety Camera Officers and Traffic Bureau Support staff to join them in supporting North Yorkshire Police's road safety strategy.

To help people understand the role of the Traffic Bureau, a short film has been produced which shows the day-to-day of the roles, but also explains the importance of the overall contribution the team makes to preventing people being killed or seriously injured on our roads. The film can be viewed here and will be shared across the force social media channels.

Speaking about the roles, Traffic Bureau Manager Dave Brown said "The roles are an ideal opportunity to make a real difference by contributing to road safety and supporting casualty reduction in our region. The Traffic Bureau is a vibrant team and the ideal candidate would be someone who could work both independently and as part of a team, be flexible in their working environment and have integrity and honesty."
