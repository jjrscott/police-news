Police are appealing for witnesses following a serious collision on the A165 today (Wednesday 27 May 2015) involving a car and two motorbikes.

The collision occurred at about 8am, on the A165 just north of the Dotterel Inn at Reighton. The two bikes were in collision with a white Mini One which was making a U-turn in the road.

One of the motorcyclists suffered serious injuries and was taken by air ambulance to Hull Royal Infirmary. The other motorcyclist also suffered serious injuries, and was taken by ambulance to Scarborough Hospital. The two men's injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.

Police are particularly keen to speak to the driver of a white box van which was ahead of the Mini One at the time of the collision, who may have important information that could assist the investigation. It was not involved in the collision and did not remain at the scene, and the driver may not have been aware that a had collision had taken place.

Anyone with information is urged to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for TC Gareth Gilleard, or emailgareth.gilleard@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk. Please quote reference number 12150087619.
