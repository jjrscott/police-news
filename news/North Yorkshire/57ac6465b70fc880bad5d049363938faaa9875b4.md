Police have issued CCTV images of three people they would like to speak to in connection with a theft from a shop in South Milford.

On the afternoon of 25 October 2016, a woman and a man entered the BP petrol station shop in Low Street. The man stole boxes of chocolates, making no attempt to pay for them. The woman left the shop when spoken to by staff. Another man was waiting outside the shop.

The man and the woman had also entered the shop on a previous occasion.

Officers would like to speak to three people pictured on CCTV, as they may have important information that could assist the investigation.

Please dial 101, select option 2 and ask for PC Lucy Hammond or Selby Police - or email lucy.hammond@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
