A man is due at court charged with offences connected to a suspected roadside scam.

The 40-year-old from Middlesbrough, who is originally from Romania, was arrested on Sunday evening (3 April 2016) after allegedly targeting a motorist on the northbound A1(M) on-slip at Wetherby services.

The victim, a 76-year-old man from Northumberland, was flagged down by the man at around 7pm. He claimed the grey Renault Laguna car had run out of petrol and needed money urgently. He allegedly offered to exchange a low-value European currency for British pounds.

The man got in the victim's car and they drove towards Leeming Bar.

The victim was able to alert the police who acted quickly to arrest the man.

Following questioning in custody, he was charged with fraud by false representation and theft of a mobile phone.

He is due to appear at Northallerton Magistrates' Court on 29 April 2016, 9.30am, court room 1.

Inspector Mark Gee, of Richmond Police, said: "While police enquiries continue to investigate this and other similar incidents across the county, we urge people to be aware of possible roadside scams involving cash for fuel or tyre repairs.

"It is also vital that people keep reporting suspicious activity to the police or Crimestoppers. Please make that call and we will do everything we can to help."

Please contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 1, and speak to the Force Control Room.

Or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 55511 and quote reference number 12160057587.
