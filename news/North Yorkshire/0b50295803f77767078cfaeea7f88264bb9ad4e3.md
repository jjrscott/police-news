Police are appealing for information after damage was caused to a Harrogate primary school.

It happened at Richard Taylor Primary School in Bilton at some point on Sunday 20 December when damaged was caused to the school pavilion and a classroom window.

Officers are requesting the publicâ€™s assistance to help establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information about persons who have been seen in the school premises whilst the school has been closed.

The school has recently suffered a number of incidents of anti-social behaviour, all of which has caused alarm to the school community.
