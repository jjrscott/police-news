Police are appealing for witnesses to a road traffic collision which occurred on the A19 just after 1pm yesterday (Wednesday 6 April).

The incident happened on the A19 Southbound near Escrick, York, and involved an HGV and a black Mini.

The 28 year old female driver, who is from the York area, was taken to the LGI by air ambulance with a serious head injury. The woman remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition.

It is believed a large stone object has come off the road and struck the windscreen of the mini.

We are appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident to contact North Yorkshire Police. Dial 101, press 2 and ask to speak to TC Dean Turner or TS Paul Cording.

Please use reference number 12160059399 when passing on information about the incident.

There was a full road closure of the A19 between Escrick and Riccall whilst emergency services worked at the scene.
