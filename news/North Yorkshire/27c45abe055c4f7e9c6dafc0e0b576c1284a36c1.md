This morning, North Yorkshire Police executed a search warrant at a property on Salisbury Terrace, York.

During the search, a quantity of Class A drugs was discovered. A 38 year old man was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply and currently remains in police custody.

Temporary Police Sergeant Tim Craven, from City of York Safer Neighbourhood Team said:

"This Operation is the latest in a number of joint initiatives involving City of York Police, Neighbourhood Support Teams and partnership agencies, targeting those who commit crime and anti-social behaviour.

"The drugs we found today were destined for the streets of York's City Centre and this will not be tolerated. We will remain relentless in our pursuit of those criminals who supply drugs in our city.

We are committed to keeping York a safe place in which to live, work and visit."
