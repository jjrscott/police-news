North Yorkshire Police are appealing for information following an incident in Draughton where a horse was seriously injured after it was allegedly spooked by a group of six people on quad bikes and a motorcycle.

It happened at around 3.50pm on Sunday 24 March 2019 on Jowetts Lane and resulted in a rider being thrown from their horse.

Enquiries suggest the group may have travelled from the Bradford area, having been sighted in Queensbury at around 1.30pm.

It is believed they then headed towards Keighley, going through Laycock and Sutton-in-Craven to Crosshills, before going towards Draughton where the incident occurred.

Following the incident it is thought they travelled back to the Bradford area via Addingham and Ilkley.

A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said: “This was a serious incident, which could have resulted in life-changing injury to the rider and horse. Extensive enquiries are ongoing, and any photographs, videos, dashcam, CCTV footage or information that could help identify this group would be gratefully received.”

If you can assist, then please contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, quoting ref 12190053024.
