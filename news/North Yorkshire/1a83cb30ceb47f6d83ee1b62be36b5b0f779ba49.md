Police are appealing for information following a break-in at a property in Sutton-in-Craven.

Police were contacted at 4.10am Tuesday 14 August 2018 by a homeowner in Sutton-in-Craven, who had been woken up by two masked men searching her bedroom.

The men demanded the woman’s car keys, believing her car was a BMW parked outside of the property.

When the woman handed over the car keys to another vehicle, both men left the property, leaving the keys and her car.

A North Yorkshire Police spokesperson said:

“This is a disturbing incident which has left the homeowner understandably shaken and upset.

“We are appealing for anyone who lives in the Sutton-in-Craven area, who noticed anything unusual or anyone acting suspiciously in the area of North Row to contact us. You may have vital information which would assist our investigation. We’d particularly like to hear from anyone in the vicinity who has CCTV footage and believes they may have recorded these men leaving the area.

“Please contact our Force Control Room on 101 and pass on the information, quoting reference number 12180150783.

“If you would prefer to remain anonymous please contact the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
