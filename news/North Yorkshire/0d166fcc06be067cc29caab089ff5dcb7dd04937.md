North Yorkshire Police have now made 74 arrests for drink and drug driving since the launch of Operation Attention at the beginning of the month.

The third week of the campaign has seen another 26 arrests made and the highest drink driving reading being registered by a 40-year-old woman arrested in Richmond who blew 180 - over 5 times the legal limit.

Since 1 December:

• 17 drug driving arrests made

• 57 drink driving arrests made

• 15 arrests made where alcohol levels were more than double the legal limit

• Highest reading so far - 180 - provided by a 40-year-old woman arrested for drink driving in Richmond - over 5 times the legal limit

• 57 men arrested

• 13 women arrested

• 10% arrests - charged with failed to provide

Sgt Andy Morton of the Roads Policing Group said:

"The message is loud and clear: drink driving costs lives. It's as simple as that. If you take a chance and get behind the wheel after drinking or taking drugs, you are not only putting your own life at risk but the lives of innocent members of the public."

"The high number of arrests so far shows how serious and committed we are to catching drink and drug drivers and bringing them to justice. Remember, if you take the chance and think you can get away with it, we are waiting to catch you."

"We continue to appeal to members of the public that if they know of someone driving under the influence of drink or drugs - please contact North Yorkshire Police on 101 or report anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555111."
