Police in Knaresborough have issued photos of some suspected stolen jewellery and are appealing for the rightful owners to come forward.

The jewellery was found in a pillow case at the side of the A59 near Whixley between York and Harrogate in May 2015.

Officers believe they were dumped by the thieves as they are not of significant value.

Anyone who believes the items are theirs is asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for PC Robert Howe.

Or you can emailrobert.howe@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

Please quote reference number 12150086976 when calling.
