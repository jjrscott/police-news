North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about the shooting of a heron that occurred in Raskelf.

The bird was discovered by a member of the public with an injury to its wing on the afternoon of Saturday 7 May 2016 and was taken to a vet in Ripon.

Unfortunately the level of the injury to the bird meant that it had to be euthanised.

We are conducting enquiries and are requesting the public's assistance to help determine the full circumstances surrounding the incident.

In particular, we are appealing for information from anybody who saw or heard shooting in the area on Saturday 7 May 2016.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation should contact us on 101, select option 2, and ask for Clare Mayes collar number 1835. You can also email clare.mayes@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12160080587.
