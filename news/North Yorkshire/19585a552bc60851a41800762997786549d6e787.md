Officers investigating the tragic death of 15 year old Josh Reeson have today arrested three more people in connection with the incident.

An 18-year-old man and two teenage boys, aged 16 and 17, were arrested on suspicion of Conspiracy to supply Class A drugs. The 17 year old was also arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs. All three have been released on conditional bail.

Josh was taken to York hospital by ambulance in the early hours of Sunday 27 September 2020, where he died later that day after having taken illegal drugs.

Josh and his friend left an address on Fulford Road around 3.10-3.15am and from there they walked down Fulford Road towards town, they then double back slightly and went down Broadway West.

The two boys then walked back on to Fulford Road, where they met a female friend near to the junction of Maple Grove.

It is at this point, on the junction of Fulford Road and Maple Grove that Josh became ill. A relative of Joshâ€™s friend called the ambulance and stayed with him until it arrived.

A 15 year old girl, 16 year old boy, 33 year old woman and 37 year old man remain on conditional bail.

Two teenage boys, aged 14 and 15 remain under investigation.
