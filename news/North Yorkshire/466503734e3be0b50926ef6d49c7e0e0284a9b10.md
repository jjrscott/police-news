Officers investigating after a cow was found dead with a rope around its neck in Whitby have made two arrests.

Two local boys aged 13 and 14 were arrested on suspicion of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal on Tuesday 2 June 2015.

They have been released on police bail to allow for further enquiries.

The Aberdeen Angus cow was found dead in a field on New Gardens, Green Lane, Whitby on Sunday 31 May 2015.

Officers are still appealing for information from the public. They would especially like to hear from people who saw anyone carrying rope in Helredale Road, the Calla Beck area or at the park at Eastside community centre on the evening of 30 May 2015.

North Yorkshire Police would like to clarify that, despite some recent reports, they have not offered a reward for information.

Anyone who can help officers with their enquiries is urged to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101 - select option 2 - and ask for PC Neil Graham or Whitby police.

If you prefer not to give your name, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Please quote reference number 12150090224 when passing information about this incident.
