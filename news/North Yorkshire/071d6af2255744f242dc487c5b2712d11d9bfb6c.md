A 20-year-old man from Selby has been found guilty of dangerous driving and disqualified from driving for 12 months.

Liam James TURTON, from Thorpe Willoughby was also ordered by York Magistrates to pay £485 in fines and costs.

On the 16 April 2016 at 8.55pm TURTON was sighted driving a Ford Fiesta ST by an officer from the forces Roads Policing Group near the Wishing Well roundabout on the Selby bypass.

TURTON approached the roundabout at high speed and as he continued in the direction of Selby swing bridge, the officer observed him overtake multiple vehicles by using the hatched area in the centre of the road, hitting speeds of between 100mph and 120mph, missing a gritter lorry travelling in the opposite direction.

Prior to the swing bridge TURTON again dangerously overtook another vehicle at approximately 100mph and approached the next roundabout, going all the way around intending to retrace his route, when the officer brought his reckless behaviour to an end.

Commenting on the sentence Traffic Constable Mark Patterson, who was the arresting officer that evening, said

"TURTON’S driving was completely inappropriate for the public road. He showed no regard for the safety of himself, other road users or the passengers in his vehicle by travelling at speeds in excess of double the limit for the road."

"The sentence shows that North Yorkshire Police Roads Police Group and the courts take instances of dangerous driving very seriously and clearly demonstrates that we will pursue, arrest and prosecute anyone who decides to drive in this manner."
