Police are appealing for witnesses after a stolen vehicle was found abandoned in a ditch on Felixkirk Road near Thirsk.

The grey Mercedes A Class was stolen from a property in Ingramgate in Thirsk after burglars broke into the house and stole the car keys.

The vehicle subsequently crashed into a ditch on the road that leads to the village of Felixkirk from Sutton Road, and was reported by a passing motorist at 7am on the morning on 31 July, however, the occupants of the car had left the scene by that time.
