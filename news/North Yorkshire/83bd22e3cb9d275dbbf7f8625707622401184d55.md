Officers from Counter Terrorism Policing North East have this morning (Monday October 30, 2017) been granted a warrant of further detention for two 14 year olds from Northallerton, who were arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences on Saturday.

Their detention is now authorised until Wednesday 1 November 2017 and the boys remain in West Yorkshire for questioning.

Both boys were arrested as part of an ongoing police led investigation on Saturday October 28. Since the weekend, searches have taken place at a number of locations in the Northallerton area. These include searches at three residential properties, which have now concluded.

Assistant Chief Constable Phil Cain, of North Yorkshire Police, said:

“North Yorkshire Police are supporting officers from the North East Counter Terrorism Unit with their investigation and searches.

“Officers believe that this is an isolated incident and the wider community are not at risk.

“We appreciate the cooperation of local residents whilst the investigation continues.”
