Following an earlier appeal for information about an assault on a woman in Harrogate in the early hours of Saturday (3 August), police have now confirmed they are investigating a further two attacks which they believe are all linked.

As well as an assault on a 26-year-old woman in Franklin Road at around 3.30am on Saturday, two other attacks have been reported with similar circumstances in Cold Bath Road and Park Parade late on Friday and early Saturday (August 2 and 3).

In each case the victims reported being followed, before attempts were made to take hold of them.

North Yorkshire Police is asking residents to be vigilant but be reassured that we are investigating these incidents and are taking appropriate measures, including increased patrols in the area .

Sgt Paul Schofield, from Harrogate CID, appealed for anyone with information about any of the attacks to come forward.

He said: "We would especially like to speak to a man who helped one of the victims when she was distressed at the bottom of Cold Bath Road, and also a woman who was waiting at the bus stop in the area of Walkers Passage who may have seen what happened. If anyone has any information concerning the incidents, or has concerns that they may have been followed, then please call 101."
