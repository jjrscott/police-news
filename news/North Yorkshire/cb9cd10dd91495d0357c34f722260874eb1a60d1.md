North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about a trap which has injured a pet cat in Barkston Ash.

The cat was found on Church Street, Barkston Ash on Saturday morning the (11th April) with it's leg caught in a Gin trap. The trap was tied to a piece of wood which was being dragged behind. It is believed the cat got caught in the trap somewhere else in the areas and was trying to get back home with the trap on it's leg.

This trap was approximately 10 inches in length. Gin traps are illegal due to them having teeth in the grips.

Anyone with information about the trap or who saw it in the area around the time of the incident or in the days leading up to the incident is asked to contact police. Dial 101, select option 2, and ask for PC Martin Temple. You can also emailmartin.temple@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If anyone finds a trap please be careful and do not touch it anywhere near the jaws.

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
