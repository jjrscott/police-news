Eight men have been arrested in York on suspicion of conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine.

North Yorkshire Police executed arrest warrants at addresses around the city early this morning. They included travellers' sites in Osbaldwick and James Street.

A police helicopter provided support for the operation, which began at around 6am.

The eight men arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to supply class A drugs are aged between 19 and 43.

A 20-year-old woman has also been arrested on suspicion of money laundering.

Investigations are ongoing and all nine people are currently in custody.

Officers from a number of policing teams across York took part in the operation, including York's Safer Neighbourhoods Teams which are continuing to support nearby residents.

Acting Detective Inspector Nichola Holden said: "Police successfully executed nine arrest warrants across York today.

"All nine people have been arrested and they are currently in custody as enquiries continue.

"In the meantime our officers are continuing to provide reassurance to nearby residents and their communities."
