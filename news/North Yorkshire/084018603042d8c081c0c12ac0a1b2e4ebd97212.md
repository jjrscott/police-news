St Mary’s church yard is a peaceful, historical beauty spot next to Old Church Lane on the hill side above Pateley Bridge. .

It is lovingly cared for by local volunteers. Within the yard are the remains of St Mary’s church including the intact bell tower. The base of the tower and the entrance to the stairs up the tower are kept secure with two, padlocked, wrought iron gates.

During the weekend of 28-29 January 2017 vandals caused damage to the church tower. On Monday morning, 30 January, a volunteer who helps with the upkeep of the yard discovered that vandals had attacked the old tower. Both of the iron gates were damaged and had been forced open. The damage to one of the gates is serious and it will be expensive to repair or replace. The vandals had entered the tower and written graffiti on stonework inside the tower. The graffiti included names "Dan", "Gaz", and "Taz".
