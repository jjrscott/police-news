North Yorkshire Police believes that the Sowerby Primary School website had unauthorised content posted by a virus which seeks out servers with weak security software.

Inspector Chris Galley, of North Yorkshire Police, said: "Other organisations and businesses both locally, nationally and internationally have had their websites compromised in a similar manner in recent months and there is no suggestion that Sowerby Primary School was deliberately targeted in any way.

"The school have now removed their website and enquiries to establish the origin of the content are ongoing.

"It is important that all organisations with a public facing website ensure that they have sound security software in place to reduce the risk of similar incidents occurring."

Sowerby Primary School sent out a message reassuring parents last night that this was not a specifically targeted threat and that there was no risk to children attending school. Both governors and police officers attended the school this morning as a reassurance to families.

Pete Dwyer, North Yorkshire's Corporate Director of the Children and Young People's Service said: "We have been working closely with the police on this matter. Our schools place great importance on website security but we understand that despite all best efforts public and corporate websites can be compromised in this way from time to time.

"We are reassured by the police in this case that this was a random breach and that children are not at any risk."
