Detectives are investigating after a woman’s handbag was snatched in Scarborough today.

The victim was walking between Cayton Low Road and Morrisons in Eastfield through the snicket at the side of the A64.

She was approached from behind – possibly by two people – and forced to the ground.

Her handbag was then stolen before the offenders made off. It is thought they went back towards Cayton Low Road.

The victim sustained only minor injuries but is understandably very shocked and upset.

The incident took place at around 4.40am today.

The handbag is black with a flap-over fastening. It contained a silver matchbox-sized tobacco tin which does not fully close and other personal possessions including paperwork.

The Serious Crime Team in Scarborough is investigating this incident and appealing for information, specifically any sightings of people acting suspiciously in the area, or anyone with information about the people involved.
