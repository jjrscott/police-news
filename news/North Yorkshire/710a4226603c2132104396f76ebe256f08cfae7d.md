A man who led police on a high-speed pursuit while he was high on drugs then crashed into an oncoming vehicle has been sent to prison.

Ashley Paul Coupland, 29, of Garforth, Leeds, seriously injured the driver of the other vehicle during the incident on the A658 at Pool Bridge, Harrogate.

Coupland failed to stop for police on the night of Friday, 1 March and made off from officers.

The pursuit ended after a head-on collision with another vehicle.

The 29-year-old was charged with a number of driving and drug offences, including causing injury through dangerous driving, driving while under the influence of drugs and possession of a class B drug, namely cannabis.

On Monday, Coupland was sentenced at York Crown Court to 28 months imprisonment and a 50-month driving ban.

After the case, PC Geri Tunney of Harrogate response said: “Coupland showed a complete disregard for his own safety and the safety of other road users on that night, all in the name of trying to evade police.

“His actions were both extremely dangerous and reckless and will not be tolerated on our roads.”

PC Tunney added that she hopes the sentence handed to Coupland serves as a warning and deterrent to other road users and highlights the dangers of driving whilst under the influence of alcohol or any other substance.

“The outcome could have been far worse and it is fortunate that this incident did not result in a fatality,” she said.
