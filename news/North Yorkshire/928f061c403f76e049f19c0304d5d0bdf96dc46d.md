A 33 year old woman from Northallerton has been jailed for more than two years for burglary offences.

Melissa Yvonne Duncan pleaded guilty to two counts of burglary at York Crown Court on Monday 16 July 2018. She was sentenced to 876 days in prison and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £170.

On 8 June, Duncan committed burglaries at two properties in Northellerton, one in Upwell Road at around 1am, and one in Springwell Lane, between 2am and 2.30am.

The resident at the property in Springwell Lane was a 98 year old woman who is deaf and lives alone. The victim of the burglary in Upwell Road was a young man who is wheelchair bound.

DC Sarah Jobe, Officer in the case, said:

“Melissa Duncan has shown no regard for the law or for wanting to turn her back on criminality and causing harm to others.

“Melissa’s crimes caused alarm and fear in her victims. I am pleased she is behind bars, where she can’t target those who are vulnerable and cause misery in communities”.
