North Yorkshire Police have released an e-fit of a man they would like to speak to, after a distraction theft took place in Harrogate.

The victim was walking back from Harrogate town centre and was making his was along the bridge on Dragon Parade, at around 1.20pm on Wednesday 16 January 2019.

As he was walking along the bridge, a man on a grey and red mountain bike rode past him and stopped and asked him the time. As the victim responded, another male on a bike approached him from behind, assaulted him and removed the backpack the victim was carrying. Both men then made off.

Officers have released an e-fit of the first man who asked the victim for the time. He is described as around 6ft 2in tall, white, approximately 20-years-old , with a slim build and was wearing light blue tracksuit bottoms and a matching blue hoodie. He had his hood up when he approached the victim and spoke with a local accent.

The other man who took the backpack was riding a black bike with white pin stripes and was wearing dirty, grey jogging bottoms and a dark coloured North Face jacket.

Any witnesses to the incident, or anyone who recognises the man from the e-fit, or can provide an identity for either man from the descriptions given, is asked to dial 101, select option 2 and ask to speak to PC Lucy Mills. You can also email Lucy.Mills@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
