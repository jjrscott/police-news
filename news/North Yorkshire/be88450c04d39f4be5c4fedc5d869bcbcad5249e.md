Police investigating a cannabis farm which was discovered in a unit on Ingleton Industrial estate on 17 December 2014, have arrested three more people in connection with the investigation.

This brings the total number of arrests so far to four.

Officers carried out the latest arrests on the morning of Monday 26 January 2015, when two men aged 45 and 19, and a 17-year-old boy, were arrested at two addresses in Bentham. As a result of the arrests, Â£2,500 was seized from one of the properties and equipment believed to be used in the cultivation of cannabis and worth thousands of pounds, was seized from an address in Halton, Lancashire.

All three have been released on police bail while police enquiries continue. A 20-year-old man who was arrested when the cannabis farm was discovered, remains on police bail.

Around 130 cannabis plants were seized from the industrial unit at the time it was uncovered.

Officers are urging anyone who has information about drug cultivation or drug dealing in their area, to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101.
