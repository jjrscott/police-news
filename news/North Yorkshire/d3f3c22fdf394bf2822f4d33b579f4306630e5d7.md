Police are appealing for witnesses following a collision on the A61 on Thursday 19 November 2015.

The incident happened at around 6.45pm at the junction on Melmerby Green Lane and involved a silver Nissan pickup and a blue Nissan Qashqai.

The Qashqai was being driven from Ripon towards the A1M by a local woman and the pickup had been approaching the junction from the Melmerby direction, driven by a man from the Pateley Bridge area.

Neither of the drivers sustained any injuries, however the road was blocked for a short time whilst the vehicles were recovered.

It is believed that there were a number of vehicles following the Qashqai along the A61 towards the A1M when the collision occurred and police would like to speak to the drivers of those vehicles.

Anyone who witnessed the collision is asked to contact police. Dial 101, press 2 and ask to speak to TC Steve Wright.

Please quote reference number 12150205838 when passing on information about the incident.

Monday 23 November 2015.
