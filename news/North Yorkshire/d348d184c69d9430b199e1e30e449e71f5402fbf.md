A spokeswoman said:

“For this campaign, we were drawing on the experience of officers on the ground, that vulnerable young people who are at a cross-roads in their lives sometimes don’t feel that they have any power. No person should feel they have no way out of victimization.

“This deliberately hard-hitting campaign was to get across the message that exploitation is not a life that anyone has to live, and that the police are there to support people who are at risk, and who need help. No victim of child sexual exploitation is to blame, and that is not the message we set out to give in our campaign.

“We have received some positive responses to the campaign, but we have also received feedback from people who didn’t feel our message was clear.

“It’s important to us that we listen to the public – and especially to the young people we’re trying to reach - so we’ve withdrawn the campaign on social media so we can do some more testing with our target audience”.
