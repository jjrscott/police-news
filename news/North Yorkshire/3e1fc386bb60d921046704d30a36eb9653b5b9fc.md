Man wanted on recall to prison now in police custody

A quantity of the drugs discovered

A 38 year-old York man has today been arrested after he was wanted on recall to prison for breach of licence and for failing to attend court earlier this year.

While attending the property in Acomb to make the arrest, officers found a large quantity of class C drugs and drugs paraphernalia. As a result the man was further arrested on suspicion of possessing class C drugs with intent to supply, and a 28-year-old woman who was also present at the property was arrested on suspicion of the same offence. On arrival at custody and following a search, the woman produced a package containing suspected class A drugs and was further arrested on suspicion of possessing class A drugs.

The arrests followed a morning of proactive patrols by officers from across York Neighbourhood Policing teams aimed at targeting street dealing of drugs in the city. Officers made a number of stop searches, locating a small amount of drugs as a result.

The man and woman currently remain in police custody.
