Selby residents targeted by fraudsters offering help with errands.

North Yorkshire Police is warning local residents not to accept help from unknown individuals knocking on doors and offering support with shopping for food and essentials.

Officers in Selby have had reports of two individuals taking bank cards and cash from housebound or self-isolating residents on the premise of purchasing supplies but then making off with the cards or money.

The individuals are described as between the ages of 25-30 years old and of a scruffy appearance.

If you have been offered any shopping services and/or have been the victim of any losses please contact North Yorkshire Police on 101.

If you live in Selby and can help identify the individuals who have been knocking on residentsâ€™ doors or you have been offered such shopping services or possibly been a victim, please call:

If you wish to remain **anonymous** , you can pass information to **Crimestoppers** on **0800 555 111.**
