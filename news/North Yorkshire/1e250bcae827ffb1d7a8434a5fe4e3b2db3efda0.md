Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was seriously injured when her car hit a lorry on the A1 in North Yorkshire.

The collision happened on the north-bound carriageway between junction 47 (Allerton Park / Knaresborough) and junction 48 near Boroughbridge.

At around 11.40pm on the night of Saturday 2 March 2019, a white Nissan Juke driven by a 24-year-old woman from West Yorkshire collided with the rear of a red lorry that was travelling in the inside lane at the time.

The driver of the lorry was uninjured.
