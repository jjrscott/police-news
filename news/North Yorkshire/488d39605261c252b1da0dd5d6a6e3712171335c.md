Three men have been arrested after a high-speed police pursuit around York.

North Yorkshire Police officers were on patrol in York in the early hours of this morning, when they became aware of a suspicious vehicle travelling along the A64 eastbound towards the city.

At about 2.30am, they caught sight of a car matching the description on the B1224 near the roundabout with the A1237 outer ring road.

The car, a white Seat Leon, accelerated away from the police, first north along the A1237 and then south back towards the A64, reaching speeds of 100mph. Officers pursued it and deployed a stinger to try to bring it to a halt.

At one point, the Seat drove along the wrong side of the A64, travelling east on the westbound carriageway.

A short time later, the car was found abandoned in a hedge near the York Designer Outlet shopping centre.

As a police dog and the NPAS police helicopter made their way towards the abandoned car, officers put a cordon round the area. At about 3am, the helicopter directed officers towards some activity near Germany Beck, which turned out to be three men in a tree.

The three men, 38, 23 and 16, were arrested and taken to custody. They have been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, failing to stop, and burglary and theft offences. They remain in custody at this time. The car was seized for forensic examination.
