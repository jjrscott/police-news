Quad bike owners are being urged to take extra steps to protect their vehicles, after a number of thefts in the Selby area in recent months.

Three quad bikes have been stolen from rural parts of Selby district in the last four months, in Camblesforth, Church Fenton and Escrick. Quad bikes have also been taken from rural areas elsewhere in the county, including Kirkbymoorside and Whitby, over the same period.

Now the local Safer Neighbourhood Team is calling on quad bike owners to ensure that they do everything possible to make life hard for rural criminals.

Sergeant Chris Jones, of Selby Police, said: "North Yorkshire is a very safe place, but unfortunately quad bikes, plant and other farm machinery are attractive targets for travelling criminals.

"While I don't want rural residents to be unnecessarily concerned, I do want them to take basic crime prevention measures to keep their valuable property safe."

People are urged to:

 * Avoid leaving quad bikes running unattended
 * Consider property identification - many quad bikes are unregistered and therefore not easily identifiable
 * Report suspicious people and vehicles loitering near isolated rural properties
 * Install adequate lighting, CCTV and strong locks to deter offenders

In addition, PCSOs across Selby have been using social media and visiting rural premises to get the crime prevention message across.
