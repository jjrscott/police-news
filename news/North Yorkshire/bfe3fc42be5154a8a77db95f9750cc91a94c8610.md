North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information about the theft of a car, which is believed to have been involved in a burglary at Creepy Crawlies play centre in Wigginton, York on Sunday 26 August 2018.

On Wednesday 22 August 2018, a silver coloured Ford Mondeo estate was stolen in York, sometime between approximately 6pm and 11.30pm.

The car, which contained tools and had a set of ladders on the roof, had been left by its owner in a yard bounded by Heworth Green, Eastern Terrace, Parade Court and East Parade. The yard is accessed from East Parade.

At approximately 2.50am on the morning of Sunday 26 August 2018, officers believe the car was used when thieves broke into Creepy Crawlies play centre on Wigginton Road, York and stole a safe from the premises. Half an hour later at 3.20am Sunday 26 August 2018, the stolen Mondeo was found by the Fire Service, burnt out on Corban Lane in Wigginton.

While making their enquiries, officers received a witness report stating that on Sunday 26 August 2018, a blue car was seen in a ditch near the burnt out Ford Mondeo. The blue car was then seen to be towed away by another car.

Police are appealing for the publicâ€™s assistance with their enquiries and are particularly interested to hear from anyone who witnessed the blue car being towed away from Corban Lane, where the burnt out Ford Mondeo was found, or anyone with information which would assist the investigation. Please contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask to speak to Alastair Foy. You may also email alastair.foy@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12180159261.

A 35-year old man from York was arrested on Monday 17 September 2018, on suspicion of theft of a car and burglary. He has since been released under investigation.
