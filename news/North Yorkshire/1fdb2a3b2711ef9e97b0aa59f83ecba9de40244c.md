A man from Merseyside has been arrested after a report of thefts from vehicles at a garage in York.

Police were called at 12.45pm on Thursday 21 January 2016 with a report that a number of satnav memory cards had just been stolen from several vehicles at a garage on the York Business Park.

Officers immediately began a search of the area, and at 2pm a suspicious vehicle was stopped near Appleton Roebuck.

Items of suspected stolen property were recovered from the car, and the driver, a 27-year-old man from St Helens, Merseyside, was arrested on suspicion of theft from a motor vehicle.

He has been released on bail, with conditions not to enter North Yorkshire, as police enquiries continue.
