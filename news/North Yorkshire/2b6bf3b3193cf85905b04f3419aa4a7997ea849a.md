North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses and information following an attempted robbery on George Hudson Street in York around 11pm on Saturday 5 December 2020.

North Yorkshire Police is currently conducting enquiries to locate the two suspects. The first suspect is described as a white male, around 25 years of age and of skinny build. He was wearing a beige Gucci baseball cap with red and green through it and a black waterproof coat with dark trousers which were tucked into white socks and trainers.
