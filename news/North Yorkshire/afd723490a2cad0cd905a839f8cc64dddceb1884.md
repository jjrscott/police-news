Earlier this week we made contact with Mr Tymon's lawyers to ask for his views on the incident at Simonstone Hall, and how - as the central person in this matter - he wished us to proceed.

This morning we received a letter from Mr Tymon's lawyers indicating that he does not wish the police to pursue an investigation on his behalf.

We understand the letter was also issued to the media.

We are grateful to Mr Tymon for clarifying his position, as we can now take this fully into account. This is North Yorkshire Police's usual approach.

We have some final interviews to complete with guests who witnessed the incident as their perspectives also need to be considered.

When these conversations are complete, we will issue a statement on our website as appropriate.
