Bernard the cat was shot with an air rifle in the Malvern Avenue area of York between 9am on Monday 9 March and 5pm the following day.

Bernard has had to have an operation to remove the pellet from his lower back which was close to his spine the cost of which has had to be paid by Bernard's owners.

In a separate incident, another cat called Harvey, was shot with an air rifle in the Fulford or Heslington area on 15 March 2015 between 12pm and 4pm.

He was shot at either close range or with a high powered air rifle. Harvey has been treated by a vet for his injuries and is currently being cared for in Leeds. Harvey was very lucky to come through this incident and had a pellet removed from between his heart and lungs.

Do you know who was responsible for either of these cruel attacks or have any information that could help our investigation?
