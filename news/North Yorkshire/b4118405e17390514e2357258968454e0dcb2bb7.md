Police in Harrogate are appealing for witnesses and information about a suspected stabbing incident on New Year’s Eve.

Officers were alerted to the Esso service station on the A59 Skipton Road at 10.10pm on Monday (31 January 2018) after a seriously injured man had turned up at the forecourt.

Paramedics confirmed that the 24-year-old man had suffered wounds to his body. He was taken to hospital by ambulance for emergency treatment. He is currently in a stable condition.

Extensive police enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances surrounding what officers describe as an “isolated incident”. There are no known risks to the wider public.

At this stage, it is believed the man sustained the injuries in the Roberts Crescent area before he went the service station on foot.

Work is continuing to identify potential suspects.

In the meantime, officers are urging people to come forward who may have witnessed the incident or possibly have information that could assist the investigation.

If you can help, please call North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2, and ask for the Harrogate Serious Crime Team.

Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.

Please quote reference number 12180242491 when providing details about this incident.
