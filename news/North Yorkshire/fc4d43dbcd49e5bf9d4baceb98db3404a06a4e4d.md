February is LGBT+ History Month.

As today marks the beginning of LGBT+ History Month, we want to say that we support this important opportunity to promote equality and diversity - for the benefit of us all.

It’s important we understand the legacy of discrimination and abuse faced by the LGTB+ community and it’s crucial we learn from history and make sure we do better today.

Throughout the month, we will be providing opportunities for colleagues to learn about LGBT+ History and what our roles are in making sure nobody in any of our communities suffers harm just because of who they are.

Don’t let your community be blighted by intolerance and hate - stand up and speak out for those who may not be able to, or may not have the confidence to do so.

You can report hate crime to North Yorkshire Police, either as a victim or for someone else, on 101 or 999.

You can also contact Supporting Victims in North Yorkshire to report a hate crime, or TruVision – A National Reporting Hate Crime Centre.

If you feel that you are not ready to speak to the police or report the crime, there are other agencies you can contact to get support;

Community Safety Trust - a National Jewish reporting Centre for hate crime

Tell Mama – A National Muslim Reporting Centre https://tellmamauk.org/

Galop – A National LGBT reporting centre https://www.galop.org.uk/
