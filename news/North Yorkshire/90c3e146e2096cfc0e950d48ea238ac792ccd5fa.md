A man who subjected his elderly neighbour to a campaign of harassment has received a fine and restraining order.

Scott Lillywhite, 46, of Meadow Lane, Eastfield was found guilty of harassment at Scarborough Magistrates’ Court on 18 February 2019.

He was given a surcharge to pay victim service £85 and made to pay £85 costs to the CPS.

A restraining order was also granted by the court against Lillywhite to protect his 93 year-old victim meaning he must not approach, or communicate with or her directly or indirectly for any reason whatsoever.

Lillywhite targeted his victim over a period of approximately four years by causing damage to the victim’s property and being verbally abusive and aggressive.

Police Constable John-Simon Coleman, of North Yorkshire Police’s Filey and Eastfield Neighbourhood Policing team, who led on the investigation said:

“Lillywhite’s alarming and distressing behaviour towards his victim caused years of grief and angst.

“The outcome of this case demonstrates that we take reports of harassment very seriously and recognise the suffering felt by victims, which can be extremely distressing.

“I encourage other victims of harassment to contact the police and make a report by calling 101.

“If you feel threatened or require emergency assistance, always dial 999.”
