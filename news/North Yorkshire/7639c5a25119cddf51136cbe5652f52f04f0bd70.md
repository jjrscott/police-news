Police are appealing for information and dash-cam footage after a lorry was broken into at Barton Lorry Park in the early hours of Monday morning.

At around 2.30am on the morning of 10 June 2019, a lorry parked up at Barton Lorry Park on the A1 near Scotch Corner was entered by a number of suspects who arrived at the park in a van.

The driver of the lorry was woken as the suspects attempted to steal boxes of shoes contained in his trailer and load them onto another lorry nearby.

One of the suspects later threatened the lorry driver.

As the suspectsâ€™ vehicle tried to leave the park, the victim blocked its way with his own vehicle and approximate eight suspects then left the area on foot.

Police are appealing to anyone who was in the area between 1am and 5am who may have seen anyone on foot or who has been flagged down either on the A1 or the roads nearby to contact them.

They would also like to hear from anyone who has any dash-cam footage that might have captured the suspects at the side of the road.

Anyone with any information is asked to call North Yorkshire Police on 101 and pass information to the Force Control Room.

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote reference number 12190104328.
