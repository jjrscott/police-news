North Yorkshire Police has now completed its routine enquiries following the incident at Hawes involving Mr Jeremy Clarkson, and we will not be pursuing this matter any further.

North Yorkshire Police takes a thorough and victim-led approach to all investigations.

Last week, the person at the centre of the incident, Mr Tymon, said that he did not wish the police to take action on his behalf. However, at that point we still needed to speak to some members of the public who were present at the time of the incident, who had been affected by the event, and whose views also needed to be considered.

Now that all the interviews are complete, we have properly established that there is no need for further police action.
