Police are appealing for witnesses after a cyclist was injured on the B1365 between Stokesley and Middlesbrough.

Between 4.50pm and 5pm on Thursday 5 May 2016, a woman in her fifties was cycling on the road near Tanton Farm. A silver Transit van passed her closely, causing her to fall to the side of the road. She was badly injured from the fall, with a broken collar bone and broken ribs.

Police are appealing for any witnesses, or anyone with information about the incident to get in touch.

PC Adam Gatenby, of Northallerton Police, said: "I want to speak to anyone who saw this incident, or who knows the driver of the silver van. There were other cars following the van, so those drivers may have seen or captured on dashcam something that may be able to assist the investigation."

Please call North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for PC Adam Gatenby or Northallerton Police, quoting reference 12160079176.
