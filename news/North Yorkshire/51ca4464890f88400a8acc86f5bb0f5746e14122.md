North Yorkshire Police are urging rural residents to be vigilant, and appealing for witnesses, after the theft of a large part of a drystone wall.

Up to 50 capstones were stolen from the wall near Pateley Bridge, with thieves making off with a 10-metre row of the triangular stones.

The theft of expensive dressed stone from drystone walls has an economic impact on rural communities, and damages North Yorkshire's cultural heritage.

The stones were stolen during the days prior to Tuesday 24 April 2018, possibly during the day on Monday 23 April. The quantity of stones taken would have required a vehicle such as a van or truck to carry away. The vehicle would have been parked at the side of Top Wath Road, presenting an obstacle for passing vehicles or walkers.

If you have information about this crime, or have any suspicions about work in which used triangular capstones have suddenly appeared since April 23, please call North Yorkshire Police on 101. Select option 1, and quote reference number 12180070221. Alternatively, email bill.hickson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

North Yorkshire Police's Rural Taskforce is supporting the Heritage Watch campaign, urging local communities to be on the look-out for theft and criminal damage that destroys the countyâ€™s cultural heritage.
