Police in York are hosting a property marking event at Acomb Explore on Saturday 12 August 2017.

Police Support Volunteers will be on hand to mark people’s valuables using the ‘dot peen’ security marking machine.

Dot peen marking involves using a tungsten carbide-tipped pin to indent an object with dots to create a visible, permanent unique number. The unique number will be registered on a database, vastly increasing the chances that it will be reunited with its owner if it is lost or stolen. The technique can be used on everything from bikes and golf clubs to power tools and laptop computers. To find out more, visit www.northyorkshire.police.uk/whatisdotpeen

Inspector Lee Pointon, of York Police, said: “Marking your property is one of the most effective ways to protect yourself from being a victim of crime. Criminals will see the permanent unique number, and know immediately that your property is too hot to handle. If the worst happened and you were targeted, marked property is far harder to sell on, and we are much more likely to be able to return it to you.

Inspector Pointon added: "My thanks go to our volunteers who are running the event and to Acomb Explore for their tremendous support."

The event is open from 10.30am to 12.30pm on Saturday 12 August 2017 at Acomb Explore (library). Everyone is welcome and there is no limit to the number of items you can bring along to be marked.

The property marking event is an extension of the Acomb Explore “Keeping safe community drop-in” scheme which was piloted earlier this year to take policing services into the community.
