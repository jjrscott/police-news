Police have issued CCTV images of two men they would like to speak to in connection with a theft from a Knaresborough shop.

On 2 March 2017, two men entered Boots at the St James Retail Park, and selected items from the shelves including Givenchy fragrances and an electric toothbrush.

One of the men was stopped by staff and handed over the goods he had tried to conceal, but the other man managed to make off. It is suspected that the men have stolen four or five bottles of Givenchy fragrance worth about Â£40 each.

Police have issued CCTV stills of two men they would like to speak to, as they may have important information that could assist the investigation.

If you recognise either of them, please call North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for PC Peter Macmillan, or email peter.macmillan@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. Please quote reference number 12170035790 when passing information.
