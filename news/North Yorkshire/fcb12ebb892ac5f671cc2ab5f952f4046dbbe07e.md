North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses following a collision between a bike and a four-wheel drive vehicle in York.

The incident happened on the Lord Mayor’s Walk/Gillygate/ Clarence Street junction at around 5.50pm on Friday (May 26).

It involved a bicycle and a four-wheel drive, possibly in blue, which did not stop at the scene or report the incident to the police.

Police believe that the cyclist’s rear wheel was clipped by the vehicle while she was cycling away from traffic lights on Gillygate and travelling onto Clarence Street.

The cyclist fell, sustaining injuries to her arms and face.

Unfortunately no members of the public stopped at the time to assist, or provide information to the cyclist or attending police officer.

Anyone with information that could help the investigation should contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for Luke Alderson.

You can also email luke.alderson@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12170091025 when passing on information.
