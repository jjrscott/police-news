North Yorkshire Police has opened the voting on the 2017 Public Choice Award, which gives the public the opportunity to decide who wins this most highly coveted trophy.

Each year, North Yorkshire Police holds an Annual Award ceremony to recognize the achievement of Officers and staff who have demonstrated particular courage, compassion or inspiration at work.

The highlight of the Award ceremony (which this year will be held on 2 November) is the Public Choice Award – which is voted on by members of the public.

This year’s nominees include:

 * PC Charlotte Thorpe, who is based at Northallerton, for a painstaking investigation which stopped a stalker
 * PC Richard Farrar, based at York, whose policing instincts kept a knife-man at bay
 * PCSOs Sean and Annie Simpson, based at Ryedale, whose care and compassion helped a woman with mental health issues to survive a crisis
 * PC Russ Buckroyd and PC James Scott, based at Tadcaster, who carried out a river rescue that prevented a girl from losing her life
 * Acting Sergeant Kimberly Copestake, Tadcaster, a firearms officer whose campaigning work has helped to break down the barriers to women taking on this vital role in the police service
 * The leaders of the Volunteer Cadet programme in Scarborough, who are helping young people to realize their full potential

Commenting on the Award, Chief Constable Dave Jones said:

"The Police and Crime Commissioner and I launched the Public Choice Award two years ago, and it has proved incredibly popular. Last year literally thousands of members of the public voted, and it really does mean a great deal to win this award. Our job is to keep people safe and that can throw up some very challenging situations. Knowing that people appreciate what you do makes a huge difference to our officers and staff, and the Public Choice Award is a great way to show that support. We have six inspiring stories to vote on this year –all very different - so I would like to encourage as many people as possible to go to our website and cast their vote."
