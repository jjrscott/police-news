North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses after a man died when his van collided with a bridge support at Stapleton near Darlington.

The collision happened at 11.20am on Saturday 23 January 2016 when a silver Ford Transit van, driven by a 44-year-old man from Darlington, was travelling along Cleasby Road and hit a bridge support underneath the A66.

Sadly the man died from his injuries.

Police are appealing to anyone who was travelling in either direction along Cleasby Road and saw the Transit van either before the collision, or anyone who witnessed the actual collision, to contact them.

Anyone with any information if asked to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for the Major Collision Investigation Team, or email _MCIT@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk_

The road was closed to allow emergency services to deal with the incident and for collision investigators to examine the scene. It reopened at around 5.40pm.
