Two men are in police custody today after being arrested on suspicion of theft from a motor vehicle and going equipped for theft in Selby.

A member of the public reported that his car had been broken into at about 3am this morning, Monday 5 June, on Barlby Road, Selby.

Police officers attended the location immediately - and within 30 minutes of the call, had arrested two men nearby. A rucksack containing tools was also located.

The men, aged 22 and 25, were arrested on suspicion of theft from a motor vehicle and going equipped for theft.
