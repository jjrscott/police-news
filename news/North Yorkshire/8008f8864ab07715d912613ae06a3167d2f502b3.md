A 28 year old man from York has been charged with a public order offence after verbally abusing a Police Community Support Officer (PCSO).

The incident was reported by members of the public after a video showing the offence was posted on Facebook.

Sergeant Kevin Kelly of the York response unit said:

"My thanks go out to all of our social media followers who reported this incident.

"My colleague, based in York, was simply carrying out her duty, preventing crime and keeping the public safe, when she was verbally abused by a member of the public who thought it was "just a bit of fun" to video the incident and post it on social media.

"This type of despicable behaviour will not be tolerated and as this case clearly shows, there will be serious consequences when we catch those who commit this type of offence.

"Thank you to those people who support the police. As police officers, we want to help our communities be safe from harm, so please continue to support us and report any incidents to us on 101".
