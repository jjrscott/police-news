Police are appealing for witnesses and information after a home was burgled in York.

Among the items stolen were expensive items of jewellery and dozens of model cars.

The burglary occurred between 5.15pm and midnight on Saturday 11 January 2020, at a house in Tatton Close, York.

The offenders gained entry by unbolting a side gate to the back garden, then using an implement from the shed to open a ground-floor window.

An untidy search was then made inside the property, and a quantity of jewellery amongst other items were stolen. This included a collection of about 50 Hot Wheels cars.

The offenders also took a sports bag to remove the stolen property.

Some of the stolen items are pictured here:
