Around 11.15am on Wednesday 4 November 2020, a blue Vauxhall Astra travelling along Station Lane in Wormald Green, turned right onto the A61 towards Harrogate. As the Astra pulled onto the A61 carriageway, the car collided with an HGV which was also travelling towards Harrogate.

The HGV continued on its journey without stopping so details of the vehicle and driver are currently unknown but it is believed to be either white or grey in colour.

The male driver of the Astra was uninjured in the collision.

North Yorkshire Police is appealing for anyone who may have seen a white or grey HGV with damage to its nearside (passenger side) travelling on the A61 towards Harrogate around the time of the incident. If you have any information which could help establish the full circumstances of this incident, please email TC David Minto on: david.minto@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk or call 101, press option 2 and dial ext 3174.
