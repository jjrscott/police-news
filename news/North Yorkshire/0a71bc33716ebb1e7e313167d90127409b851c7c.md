Police are appealing for witnesses after an incident on a bus near York.

On Tuesday 27 June 2016, at about 11.20am, a mother and her two sons were travelling on the number 13 bus to Copmanthorpe.

While on the journey, one of the boys, aged 3, got up and moved seats, sitting down on the right-hand side of the bus, opposite a woman on the left-hand side.

The mother then started to walk towards her son, and on doing so the woman sitting opposite took hold of the boy's forearms and attempted to pick him up, saying "come on young man, go sit with your mother".

The boy became very distressed and the woman attempted to pick the young boy up again by his forearms, but he managed to wriggle free.

He suffered reddening to his forearms and was very upset and distressed by the incident.

The woman involved is described as white, medium-brown hair tied in a low ponytail, slim build, in her fifties, wearing a mid-length skirt and carrying a satchel.

There were around six or seven other passengers on the bus who may have witnessed the incident.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or can provide any information about it is asked to contact PC Gemma Churchward. Dial 101 and select option 2. Please quote reference number 12160113739.
