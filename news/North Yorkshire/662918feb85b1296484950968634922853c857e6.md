We have postponed our planned sale of historical items from our old headquarters in Newby Wiske following feedback from retired officers. We had already retained an number of items prior to the planned sale and these are due to go on display at our new headquarters in Alverton Court. We are now going to review the remaining items that were destined for auction.

Assistant Chief Constable Amanda Oliver, said: “My thanks go to the retired officers who have raised this issue. We have now decided to postpone the auction due to the level of concern and feedback we have received about the sale.

“Although a great deal of work and consultation was carried out to review each item before they were put up for auction, and we did in fact, retain a large number of artefacts prior to the proposed sale, we will carry out a further review before any sale goes ahead.

“The review will also include a decision on the most appropriate location to hold the auction in future.

“We will keep members of the public informed about the outcome of the review through our website.

“In the meantime as part of the review, we will consult with people who have an interest in the items, including the North Yorkshire’s Association of Retired Police Officers before we make any final decisions.”
