At 9.14pm on Tuesday 10 November, a technical issue affected our Force Control Room in York.

mergency 999 calls were immediately rerouted and answered by our colleagues in Humberside Police.

However, some people may have experienced difficulty using the 101 emergency number.

Business continuity plans have been followed and all calls are now being answered by North Yorkshire Police normally. We would like to reassure members of the public that 999 emergency calls continued to be answered throughout.

We would ask anyone who called the 101 non-emergency number tonight but was unable to get through to call us back, and we apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.
