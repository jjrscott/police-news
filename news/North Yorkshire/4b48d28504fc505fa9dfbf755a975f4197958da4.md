North Yorkshire Police is appealing for a woman who was seen getting into a vehicle in York in the early hours of this morning to come forward following concerns for her safety.

She was seen entering a vehicle which contained three men on the Lawrence Street junction with Foss Islands Road at approximately 2.40am on Monday 13 November 2017.

The vehicle is described as a silver hatchback. It was seen to perform a U-turn in the Enterprise Rent-A-Car car park before travelling towards Hull Road.

It is unclear if there is anything to be concerned about, and there have been no reports to suggest otherwise, however we need to be certain that nothing untoward has happened. .

In particular, we are appealing for the female and the three men to come forward or information to help us to identify them.

If this is you, or you can help identify the woman or three men, please North Yorkshire Police on 101.

If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote the North Yorkshire Police reference number 12170203966.
