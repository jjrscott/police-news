North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses in relation to a 2-in-1 burglary that occurred in Scarborough.

It happened at a property on Nelson Street between 2am and 6:30am on Wednesday 12 December 2018 when a residential property was entered and the car keys stolen.

A number of additional enquiries are currently ongoing to establish the identity of the offender(s).

PC Liam Cromack, who is investigating this incident, said, "I am appealing for anybody in the area of Nelson Street who may have seen anybody acting suspiciously during the early hours of 12th December to come forward, particularly those who may have seen the vehicle being driven away from the address."
