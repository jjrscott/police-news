A man has been given a police caution after admitting shooting wild birds in his own and neighbouring gardens in the Seamer area of Scarborough, simply because he disliked being disturbed by the sound of their calls and songs.

North Yorkshire Police received a report in March 2018 from local residents, after they found several dead birds in their garden and heard the sound of an air weapon being discharged nearby.

When interviewed by police, the man, in his 70s, said he believed he was within his rights to shoot the birds if they were causing a nuisance and disturbing him.

PC Graham Bilton, who is the wildlife crime officer for North Yorkshire Police in the Scarborough area, said: "Members of the public need to be aware that all wild birds, active nests and eggs are protected within the UK, with very few exceptions which are strictly controlled under licence."

He added that people should seek advice from relevant organisations, including the police's specialist wildlife crime officers, the RSPCA or the RSPB if they are in any doubt as to what they can legally do.

The man was issued with a police caution for killing non-Schedule 1 wild birds and firing an air weapon beyond his premises. As a requirement of the caution, the man has had to dispose of the air rifle in question.
