Police investigating a sexual assault against a teenage girl in Thirsk are appealing for information.

The 15-year-old was approached by a man outside the Crown and Anchor pub in Sowerby.

She was walking along the road and was next to the sign for Gravel Hole Lane when the man confronted her and touched her inappropriately.

The girl fled back up Gravel Hole Lane away from Sowerby Road and the man is believed to have gone towards Thirsk on Sowerby Road.

The victim is vulnerable and is not able to give an exact date, but detectives believe the incident happened between Sunday 11 February and Tuesday 13 February. It was reported to police yesterday.

The suspect is described as white, tall and aged 40 to 50.

He had scruffy, unwashed, greasy hair, bushy eyebrows, a large unkempt beard and crooked, discoloured teeth.

He was wearing a T-shirt and tracksuit trousers. He spoke with a non-local accent, possibly from the North East or Merseyside.

Anyone who saw anyone matching his description in the area or has any information that could help detectives is urged to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for Nicola Pattinson.
