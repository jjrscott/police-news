Officers want to talk to the man about an incident at the Esso petrol station on Harrogate Road in Leathley.
On 17 May the driver of a van filled up with £20 worth of fuel and left without paying. Subsequent investigations lead officers to believe that the registration number of the van was false.
Officers are asking members of the public to contact them if they can help identify the man.
If you have any information please contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for PC George Frost or email George.frost@northyorkshire.pnn.police.uk
If you wish to remain anonymous, you can pass information to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
Please quote incident number 12160085948.
