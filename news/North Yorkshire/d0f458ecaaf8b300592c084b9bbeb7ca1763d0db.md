Police in North Yorkshire are warning people not to be taken in by conmen making phone calls about bank fraud and claiming to be police officers.

The warning comes after a member of the public from Ripon took a call from a man claiming to be a detective who was investigating a fraud on their bank account and asked for bank account details including Personal Identification Numbers (PIN).

He asked them to call back on the police non-emergency number101, to verify his identity. The victim's phone call to 101 then appeared to be re-routed back to the suspects who held their line open.

Thankfully, in this instance, the intended victims did the right thing and did not give any bank details over the phone. They became suspicious of the caller and reported the incident to the police.

North Yorkshire Police are warning members of the public not to be taken in by this scam. A police officer will never, ever ask for your bank account security details.

Please don't ever give your bank account details to anyone who calls you out of the blue.

Please also wait at least five minutes and ensure you have a dialling tone before you make another call from your phone.

Anyone who wants to report a fraud can contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or online at www.actionfraud.police.uk or your local police on 101.

In an emergency always call 999.
