A woman has been reunited with her bike after it was believed stolen from York District Hospital whilst she was working last Thursday night (14 May 2020). The woman finished her night shift to discover her bike lock had been cut and her bike taken at some point during the night or early morning.

North Yorkshire Police Community Support Officers on patrol in the city, spotted a man riding a bicycle which appeared to match the description of the stolen one. Officers questioned the man and were able to establish this was the stolen bike, which has now been returned to its owner.

The 31 year old man has been arrested on suspicion of theft and is currently in police custody.
