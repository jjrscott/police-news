North Yorkshire Police are appealing for witnesses to an alleged robbery of takings from a taxi driver on Sunday 25 October in Brompton-on-Swale.

The alleged robbery took place as the taxi driver made a drop off at the The Crown Pub on Station Road, Brompton-on-Swale at around 5.30pm on Sunday 25 October.

As the suspect walked away in the direction of Brompton Court, the taxi driver sounded her horn to draw attention to the individual.

The suspect is decribed as a white man in his early 30's with a slim to medium build. He wore thick, dark rimmed glasses and spoke with a local accent. He was also described as having a large nose.

North Yorkshire Police are appealing to any witnesses who were in the area at the time of the alleged robbery who may have heard the beeping horn or who recognise the description of the suspect, to get in touch.

Please contact Northallerton Serious Crime Team on 01609 789 418 and quote reference 12150189458.
