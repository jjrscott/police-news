A simple police check of a vehicle seen driving erratically in York has led to an arrest for intent to supply illegal drugs and a knife taken off the streets.

At about 9.30pm on Thursday 4 July, two PCSOs from Yorkâ€™s Neighbourhood Policing Team were on proactive patrol when they spotted a suspicious black Fiat Punto on Fourth Avenue.

The car came to a stop, and the five occupants were spoken to. Officers attended, and the driver, an 18-year-old man, was reported for summons for driving without insurance and without a licence.

Due to a strong smell of cannabis coming from the vehicle, it was searched, and another of its occupants, a 17-year-old boy, was found to be in possession of drugs and a knife.

He was arrested on suspicion of possession of class A and class B drugs, possession with intent to supply class B drugs, and possessing a knife in a public place. He remains in custody at this time.

The car was also seized.
