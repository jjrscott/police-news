People across the county will be able to find out more about police activity and performance from this month, by viewing one of North Yorkshire Police's most important regular meetings live on the internet.

The Corporate Performance, Delivery and Scrutiny Board, which takes place once a month, is chaired jointly by the Police and Crime Commissioner and the Chief Constable to monitor progress against the Police and Crime Plan - the document which sets out the priority areas of action, based on consultation with the public.

From June, the Board meeting will be streamed live over the internet to allow members of the public to view the proceedings as they happen.

At 1pm on Monday 22 June, people will be able to go to the Police and Crime Commissioner's website to watch what happens and discover what is discussed at this high level meeting.

Commenting on the decision to live-stream the meeting, the Police and Crime Commissioner, Julia Mulligan, said: "The public helped to decide the priorities for the police service in North Yorkshire, so it is right that the public should be able to check on how well those priorities are actually being delivered. The Chief Constable and I want the business of policing in our county to be as transparent as possible, and the live-streaming and recording of this meeting will help to achieve that."

Dave Jones, Chief Constable of North Yorkshire Police, said: "Being open and accountable is an important part of maintaining public confidence in the police service, so the Commissioner and I welcome this new development. It is a chance for people to develop a more in-depth understanding of the work that we do through North Yorkshire Police and the Commissioner's office to keep the public safe and improve victim care. I hope that as many people as possible will take the opportunity to view the meetings."

**To watch the Corporate Performance, Delivery and Scrutiny Board meeting live, go to www.northyorkshire.police.uk/scrutinyon Monday 22 June between 1pm and 3pm.**

A recording of the meeting will be available on the same page soon after.
