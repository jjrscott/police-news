Detectives in York are appealing for information about an assault that left a man in hospital.

It happened on Tanner Row, York, at approximately 12.40am today.

A man in his 20s was taken to hospital with head injuries, where he remains in a serious condition.

Two men in their 20s have been arrested in connection with the incident. One has been released under investigation while enquiries continue. The other currently remains in police custody.

Police believe that, while the assault took place in Tanner Row, it could have stemmed from an incident that happened inside a nearby nightclub earlier in the evening.

Detectives are urging anyone who witnessed either incident, or has other information that may help the investigation, to contact North Yorkshire Police on 101, select option 2 and ask for York Serious Crime Team. You can also contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Please quote incident number 12170224662 when passing on information.
