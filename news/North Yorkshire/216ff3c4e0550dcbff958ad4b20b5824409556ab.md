A 27 year-old man from the Rochdale area is due to appear in court after three Rolex watches were taken from a York jewellery shop.

The man was arrested following a police pursuit which took place on numerous roads including the A63 and A1 on Saturday 26 January 2019. A number of police resources including the police helicopter assisted the operation.

After questioning in custody the man was charged with:

 * Theft from a shop
 * Failing to stop
 * Driving a motor vehicle dangerously

He has been remanded in custody to appear at York Magistrates’ Court on Monday 25 February 2019.

PC Mark Grimes, leading the investigation, said:

"Following our original appeal, information provided by a number of partner organisations in the York area and the local York City Neighbourhood Policing Team enabled us to locate a vehicle being driven by a man matching the description of the suspect.

“This case highlights the importance of partnership working and how small pieces of information, when received, can significantly help police investigations.”
