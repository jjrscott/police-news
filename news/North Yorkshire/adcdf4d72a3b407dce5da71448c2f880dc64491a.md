Over the past few days, we have been contacted by concerned members of the public, who have seen media coverage about Jeremy Clarkson's actions at Simonstone Hall, and who want to know what action the police are taking.

No-one who was present at the hotel during the incident came forward to report an offence to the police. Nonetheless, we have a duty to investigate where we believe an offence might have been committed, and that is what we have been doing with this case.

We have already spoken to some people who were in the hotel at the time, but there are still others we need to speak to, who could help us to determine exactly what happened. Also, as is usual in these circumstances, we have made contact with Mr Tymon through his lawyers, to ask him to speak to us so we can ascertain how he wishes to pursue this matter.

When these routine enquiries are completed, we will be able to assess whether or not further action needs to be taken from a police perspective.

Meanwhile, we'd like to reassure the public that the matter is in hand, and we dealing with it responsibly and proportionately.
