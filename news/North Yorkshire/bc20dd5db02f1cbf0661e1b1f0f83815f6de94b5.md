A man in his 50s has died following a collision near Pickering.

A blue Mini Cooper was travelling along the A169 Malton Road when it veered off the carriageway, through a fence and came to a stop in a garden.

The incident took place at around 9.50pm yesterday (14 May) near the Black Bull Inn.

The man in his 50s, believed to be the driver, was pronounced dead at the scene.

A second man, in his 20s and believed to be the passenger, was taken to hospital for treatment. His injuries were not believed to be life-threatening.

Both men are from the Ryedale area.

Ambulance crews and the fire service also attended. Nobody else was injured.

North Yorkshire Police is appealing for witnesses to the incident, or anyone who saw the vehicle shortly before the collision.
