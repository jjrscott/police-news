A man who was caught with cocaine worth £38,000 in his home has been jailed for four-and-a-half years.

Officers discovered the solid 475.9g brick of cocaine, £22,000 in cash and a set of digital scales in a bedroom at Shannon Bush's home in Queensway, Cambridge, after carrying out a warrant on 21 September last year.

Bush, 26, was not in but was arrested two days later. He initially denied possession with intent to supply class A drugs but changed his plea to guilty on the first day of his trial and was sentenced last Thursday (12 April).

PC Daniella Lewis said: "Bush was a member of a local organised crime group, which we worked relentlessly to disrupt.

"We will not tolerate the supply of drugs and will take robust action against anyone suspected of being involved."

A Proceeds of Crime Act direction hearing will take place on 5 July at Peterborough Crown Court.

Bush jailed for four-and-a-half years. 475.9g of cocaine was found at Bush’s home £22,000 in cash was found at Bush’s home
