A Peterborough man has been charged with various driving offences including taking a vehicle without consent.

Daniel Holmes, 38, was arrested yesterday afternoon (3 September) in Orton Goldhay in connection with a missing vehicle.

He has since been charged with two counts of taking a vehicle without the owner's consent, driving while disqualified and without insurance, handling stolen goods and making off without payment.

Holmes, of no fixed address, has been remanded in custody to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court today (4 September).
