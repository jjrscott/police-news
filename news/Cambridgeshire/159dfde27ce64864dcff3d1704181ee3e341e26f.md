A teenage drug dealer who tried to hide Â£500 worth of cannabis in a bush has been jailed for 11 months.

Joseph Lyon, 19, was spotted by officers as they arrived at a house in Crispin Close, Impington, on Friday, 8 June, following reports of an unlicensed driver in a red Ford Mondeo the previous day.

Lyon was walking towards the Mondeo with a rucksack but ditched the bag in a bush when he saw the officers approaching. He was arrested after 50 grams of cannabis, scales and small plastic bags were found in his rucksack.

Lyon, of Crispin Close, was sentenced at Cambridge Crown Court today (17 August) after pleading guilty to two counts of possession of a class B drug with intent to supply. He received 11 months for each count, to run concurrently.

DC Martin Hardy said: "Lyon set out that day with a clear intention to break the law and this prosecution demonstrates how seriously we and the legal system treat drug dealing."
