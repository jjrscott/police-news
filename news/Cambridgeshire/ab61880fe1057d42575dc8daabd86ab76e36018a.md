Officers are appealing for information following two robberies that took place last night in Cambridge.

The first incident took place at Parker's Piece at around 10.50pm.

A group of 10-15 youths approached four teenaged victims on bikes and circled them before members of the group demanded that they empty their bags.

Other members of the group then told one of the victims to hand over his coat and wallet before they fled the scene towards Gresham Road.

Ten minutes later on Coleridge recreational ground, three teenagers were approached by what is believed to be the same group.

They asked for the victim's names and all produced weapons including wooden batons when they did not respond.

One of the victims was then assaulted and left with a serious facial injury before the group fled.

DS Graham Newton said: "This has been a terrifying incident for the victims, who have been left physically injured and emotionally shaken.

"I urge anyone who saw these incidents take place or who can tell us who is responsible to get in touch."

Anyone with information regarding this incident should call police on 101 quoting 35/24113/18 and 35/24118/18, or visit www.cambs.police.uk/report. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
