A man has been fined after he assaulted a police officer who stopped a car he was travelling in.

Adam Gulrajani, 29, was a passenger in the vehicle, which was pulled over in Barton Road, Cambridge, on 13 June 2017.

When the driver failed a roadside breath test he began to resist arrest. Gulrajani got out of the car and grabbed the officer from behind and pulled him backwards causing him to fall and injure his knee.

Gulrajani, of Heslerton Way, Barrington, at the time of being detained, denied assault with intent to resist arrest. However, yesterday (24 April) at Huntingdon Magistrates' Court he was found guilty.

He was fined £500, ordered to pay a further £500 compensation to the officer, a victim surcharge of £50 and £625 costs.

PC Luke Charlton said: "The assault caused a serious knee injury which has left the officer unable to continue frontline duties.

"We take assaults on officers incredibly seriously and will always seek to bring perpetrators before the courts."
