Detectives investigating the stabbing of two men in Werrington last weekend have made an arrest.

A 21-year-old man from Orton Goldhay was arrested on Sunday morning (8 November) in connection with the incident which took place in Storrington Way at about 1am on Sunday 1 November.

The victims, men aged 18 and 21, were both stabbed multiple times but managed to get to a nearby house where first aid was given and an ambulance called.

Both men were taken to Peterborough City Hospital where they were treated for multiple stab wounds, however they were both discharged later the same day.

The 21-year-old suspect was also arrested in connection with the stabbing of a 25-year-old man in Amberley Slope, also in Werrington, on 5 October.

Further offences of criminal damage, blackmail and fraud are also being investigated.

He has since been bailed to return to Thorpe Wood Police Station on 4 December.
