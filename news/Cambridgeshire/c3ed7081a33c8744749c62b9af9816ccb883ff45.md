Officers have increased patrols following two attacks on sex workers in Peterborough.

The first incident took place on Sunday (23 September) at around 4am, when the victim was picked up in a silver ford and driven to Crown Street before being attacked by a man described as white and possibly having an eastern European accent.

The second incident happened on Tuesday (25 September) between 11.30pm and 1am. The victim was picked in a small, dark car on Burghley Road and assaulted on Bishops Road by a man described as white and possibly having an eastern European accent.

DS Gareth Williams said: "Any information that could lead us to those responsible is crucial and I would urge members of the public to come forward. We are working with local charities and agencies to provide safety advice to sex workers in the city.

"The victims of these attacks have been left understandably shaken and we want to do everything we can to ensure that this does not happen again."

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 quoting incident 27 of the 25 September or report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report. Alternatively, you can report anonymously by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or visit crimestoppers-uk.org
