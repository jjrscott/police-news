Officers have released CCTV images of a man they would like to speak to in connection with a knife-point robbery in Peterborough.

At about 5.30am on 1 January a man threatened the victim with a knife and demanded he hand over his phone in an alleyway off Broadway, between Tesco and O'Neill's nightclub.

The victim, a man in his 20s, handed over the phone, which also contained his bank card, driving license and about Â£30 cash within the case.

The suspect ran off on foot and the victim was left uninjured.

Anyone with any information should call police on 101 or visit www.cambs.police.uk/report, quoting crime reference number 35/123/20.
