A second full gang injunction has been issued in Peterborough to an 18-year-old man from Paston.

Liam Smith, of Sheepwalk, was served the injunction order today (Friday, 13 March) for his involvement with a group of youths who identify themselves as the 'Paston Boys'.

PC Alice Ward, from the Neighbourhood Policing Team in Peterborough, said: "For the last two to three years the local community in Paston has suffered at the hands of this group. We have received report after report about anti-social behaviour, criminal damage, carrying of weapons and violence.

"Crimes have been raised and investigations carried out in an attempt to take action against the boys, however victims have often disengaged due to fear for their personal safety and that of their properties, and reprisals from the gang."

Gang injunctions allow courts to place a range of prohibitions and requirements on the behaviour and activities of a person involved in gang-related violence. These conditions could include prohibiting someone from being in a particular place or requiring them to participate in rehabilitative activities.

They aim to prevent serious violence from occurring, break down violent gang culture and engage gang members in positive activities to help them leave the gang.

Conditions of Smith's injunction forbid him:

 * From covering or obscuring his face by either wearing a face covering such as a balaclava or mask, or using an item of clothing to cover his face, for the purpose of concealing his identity or intimidating others
 * Entering Honeyhill Road, Paston
 * From approaching any student attending Honeyhill Learning Centre, Paston, or waiting outside the Honeyhill Learning Centre
 * From entering the Chadburn Centre, Paston
 * From being in the company of 11 other specified people in any public place
 * From causing harassment, alarm or distress to any person, including emergency service workers
 * From being in possession of any offensive weapon in a public place
 * From touching or using a motorcycle unless the motorcycle is owned by him and is properly insured and taxed

In the event of a breach, a power of arrest is attached to all conditions, and Smith will be in contempt of court and may be sent to prison. The injunction will remain in place until 12 March, 2022.

PC Ward added: "We have been working tirelessly to get these injunctions in place for our local community. These boys have been causing so much distress to both residents and businesses, and have shown no respect for the law.

"Gang injunctions are a valuable tool in preventing gang-related violence alongside a range of other prevention, detection and enforcement measures."

Interim injunctions have been served on four other members of the 'Paston Boys', aged 14, 15 and two aged 17, imposing temporary conditions on them all.

Hearings to apply for full injunctions on the other four members are due to take place in the coming months.
