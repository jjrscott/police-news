A closure order has been secured on a property in Trumpington following police action.

Officers from the Cambridge City Neighbourhood Policing Team submitted an application to Cambridge Magistrate's Court following multiple reports of anti-social behaviour at 26 Wilson Court.

The closure order was granted on Tuesday (9 March) and the property will be closed for three months.

PC Helena Campbell from the team said: "In recent months we've had reports of drug taking, littering, noise and general anti-social behaviour all related to the property.

"We hope this closure order will not only reduce the anti-social behaviour coming from the address, providing respite for other residents, but allow the tenant to access further support, engage with partner agencies and have a steady and stable home to live in."

The closure order states the house be closed in accordance with the Anti-Social Behaviour and Policing Act 2014 and only permits access to the tenant, housing and support services and emergency services until 9 June. If anyone is found on the premises unlawfully they render themselves liable to arrest.
