A man who was caught on CCTV burgling a Cambridge home has been jailed.

Scott Reynolds, 31, of HMP Peterborough, was sentenced to 16 months imprisonment at Cambridge Crown Court yesterday (7 February) after pleading guilty to one count of burglary.

The court heard how in November last year, Reynolds was captured on his victim's home security cameras scaling the garden fence of a property in Radegund Road before climbing onto the roof and leaving via the front door with a white bag.

Reynolds made off with a Playstation, games and a laptop worth more than Â£1,000.

Officers were able to identify Reynolds through CCTV footage from the property.

Detective Sergeant Graham Newton said: "Reynolds is a prolific thief who, thanks to this sentence, won't be on our streets for some time.

"We urge residents to look out for each other and report any suspicious behaviour to police."

Jailed: Scott Reynolds
