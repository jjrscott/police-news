Police have released an image of a man they would like to speak to in connection with a distraction burglary in South Cambridgeshire.

A report was received yesterday (29 October) after a 77-year-old man had his wallet stolen from his home in Cantelupe Road, Haslingfield.

A man visited the house at about 3pm offering gardening services before excusing himself and taking the victim's wallet.

Anyone with information or who recognises the man in the picture should contact police either by speaking to a web-chat operator on our website www.cambs.police.uk/report quoting 35/73674/20 or, if you do not have access to a computer, by calling 101.
