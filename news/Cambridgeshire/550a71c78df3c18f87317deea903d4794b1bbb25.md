Do you recognise these men? We'd like to speak to them in connection with a theft of a wallet last year.

On 11 October, cards that were in the wallet were used to carry out transactions and withdraw cash in Cambridge totalling more than Â£3,400.

Officers are keen to identify the men in the CCTV images and urge anyone who may know who they are to pass on information by reporting online at www.cambs.police.uk/report and quote 35/36789/18, or you can call 101.

Do you recognise these men?
