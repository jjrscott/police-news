A man caught with a stash of drugs and cash in his car has been jailed.

Ardin Muja, of no fixed abode, was spotted by officers slowly driving around Cherry Hinton Hall car park in his Vauxhall Astra on 9 July.

Suspecting he was there to deal drugs, officers from the Southern Neighbourhood Support Team stopped and searched the 23-year-old and found a sock with 11 bags of cocaine inside and Â£250 cash.

At Cambridge Crown Court on Friday (14 August) after previously pleading guilty to possession with intent to supply cocaine, Muja was sentenced to 27 months in prison.

PC Hannah Brooks from the team said: "We're committed to finding and putting people like Muja before the courts so they can be sentenced for the crimes they have committed."
