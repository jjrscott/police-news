We've released CCTV images of two men we would like to speak to in connection with a theft in Peterborough.

On Tuesday (13 February) three handbags were taken from behind the counter of a gym in Brook Street.

The bags contained an iPad, headphones, clothes, cash and debit and credit cards worth more than Â£900.

Anyone with information is asked to report online quoting reference CF0084380218.

Do you recognise these men?
