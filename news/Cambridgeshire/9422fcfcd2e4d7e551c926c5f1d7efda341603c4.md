A man is due in court today (Friday 18 December) charged with knife and drug offences in Peterborough following a call from a member of the public.

We were called at about 3pm yesterday afternoon with reports of a possible drug deal taking place near to the Regional Swimming Pool in the city centre.

A 25-year-old man was arrested and has since been charged with being in possession of a knife in a public place and being in possession of cannabis.

He has been remanded in custody to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court today.

Anyone with information about someone who carries a knife is urged to report it to us online at https://bit.ly/2LNDLyZ.
