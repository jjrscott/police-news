We have released CCTV images of two men we would like to speak to in connection with a burglary in Ely last month.

In the early hours of Saturday, 20 October, jewellery was stolen from an insecure house in Little London Gardens. The value of the jewellery is not known at this stage.

Anyone who recognises the men pictured or has any information regarding the incident should call police on 101 quoting 35/38957/18 or contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
