A man who sent coded text messages to sell drugs in Cambridge has been jailed for more than three years.

Zakeria Ahmed, 23, of Grangeway, Camden pleaded guilty to being concerned in the supply of crack cocaine and heroin and was today (2 May) sentenced to three years and seven months in prison.

Cambridge Crown Court heard how officers arrested Ahmed on 20 December 2016 at a property in Staffordshire Street, Cambridge where he was found with an old Nokia mobile phone and cannabis. He also had Â£500 rolled up in cling film his underwear.

Multiple text messages were found on his phone referring to drugs as 'cement', 'food' and 'coffee'. He also received a message from an associate saying that they couldn't wait 'till you boys got own chain of restaurants across east Anglia'.

Detective Constable James Weston said: "Ahmed's immediate custodial sentence serves as a stark reminder to people wanting to sell class A drugs in Cambridgeshire. The sale of drugs brings misery to communities, facilitating further crimes to be committed such as thefts, burglaries and robberies.

"Cambridgeshire Constabulary will always look to prosecute offenders who are in the business of selling drugs and this case highlights the fact that you don't need to be in possession of drugs to be found guilty."
