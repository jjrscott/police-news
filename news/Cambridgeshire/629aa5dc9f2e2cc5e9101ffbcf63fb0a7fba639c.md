A drug dealer who was found to have more than £800 in cash together with three bags of cannabis has been sentenced.

Muhammed Rashid, of Desmond Avenue, Cambridge, was searched after a car was stopped in Ditchburn Place, Cambridge, on 24 February last year in relation to a separate investigation.

The 23-year-old, who was the front seat passenger, immediately admitted he had cannabis with him.

However, he was also found with £842 in cash and two phones. One of them was a Nokia which, when analysed, showed evidence of drug dealing.

Rashid was arrested on suspicion of being in possession of a class B drug with intent to supply.

Officers also searched his home where they discovered a Taser disguised as a torch in his bedroom draw, together with a third phone and a Samsung tablet.

In interview, he claimed the cannabis was for his own use and the money was "obtained legitimately" from work.

He also told officers the Nokia phone found in his pocket wasn't his and that he'd found it on a bench where it had been left by someone he knew but refused to name.

Rashid was further arrested on suspicion of possessing a prohibited weapon, though declined to comment when asked about it in interview.

However, he later pleaded guilty to both charges at Cambridge Crown Court on 4 February.

Rashid was sentenced at Huntingdon Law Courts today (22 March) where he was handed nine months in prison, suspended for 12 months. He was also ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work.

DC Marcus Johnson, who investigated, said: "Drugs can have a devastating effect on the lives and communities of Cambridgeshire and we will continue to do all we can to bring offenders before the courts.

"The car Rashid was in was stopped for an unrelated matter but that work by officers allowed us to bring another drug dealer to justice and seize a weapon, stopping it from potentially being used on the streets.

"We rely on people in our communities being our eyes and ears. If you suspect something isn't right, it more than likely isn't."
