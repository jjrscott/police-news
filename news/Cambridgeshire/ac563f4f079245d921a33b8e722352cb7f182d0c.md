A registered sex offender has been jailed after breaching his notification requirements.

David Livingstone, 57, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to one count of failing to comply with Sex Offenders Register notification requirements.

At Cambridge Crown Court yesterday (13 August) he was jailed for eight months.

Officers visited his then home in Wisbech after he failed to attend two appointments with the probation team on 25 June and 2 July.

Livingstone wasn't there and evidence suggested he had moved to Cambridge. He was tracked down by officers living on the streets in Charing Cross, London on 20 July.

DC Andy Harding said: "All registered sex offenders in our county are allocated to a member of our Public Protection Unit to be monitored. Part of this includes carrying out unannounced visits at their home address, accessing their electronic devices and speaking with them about their daily activity.

"Failure to comply with the requirements will result in a breach and in Livingstone's case, being sent back to prison."
