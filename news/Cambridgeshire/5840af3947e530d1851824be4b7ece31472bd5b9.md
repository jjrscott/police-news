A man has been fined following public order offences at a mosque after a disagreement about a policy on wearing shoes.

Gul Faraz, 62, attended Faizan E Madina Mosque in Gladstone street on 17 August where he got into an argument with the prayer leader.

The argument became heated and Faraz stated 'I'll break your teeth' before leaving.

On 21 August he returned to the mosque and again became aggressive, this time shouting racial abuse.

He was arrested the following day and has since pleaded guilty to one count of using threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour with intent to cause fear of violence and one count of racially aggravated harassment.

Faraz, of Cambridge Avenue, was sentenced at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on Monday (24 August) where he was ordered to pay a £300 fine, £85 in costs and £34 victim surcharge.

PC Phillipa Mallett said: "There is no place for racial abuse in our communities, we have great relationships with all our residents and we will put you in front of the courts if you go against these values."
