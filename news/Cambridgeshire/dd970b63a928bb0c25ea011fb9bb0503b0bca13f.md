A cyclist has died following a collision this afternoon (24 July) near Fulbourn.

The man was cycling along Shelford Road, just outside Fulbourn, when he was in collision with a silver Vauxhall Corsa being driven by a woman at just after 4.15pm.

Emergency services were called but the man was declared dead at the scene.

The driver of the car was shaken but not hurt and has spoken to police.

The road has been closed to allow investigations to take place and is not expected to reopen until later on this evening.

Police are now looking to speak to anyone who witnessed the collision or the car or cyclist just prior. They would particularly like to hear from two separate passing motorists who stopped at the scene before continuing on their way.

Anyone who witnessed the collision or has dash cam footage is urged to call 101 and ask for Sgt Craig Wheeler, at the road policing unit, or visit www.cambs.police.uk/report
