We are appealing for information after two men were stabbed in Werrington in the early hours of this morning (Sunday 1 November).

The men, aged 18 and 21, had walked up to the shops in Storrington Way at about 1am and were approached by a group of three men who were all wearing face coverings.

The pair were both stabbed multiple times but managed to get to a nearby house where first aid was given and an ambulance called.

Both men were taken to Peterborough City Hospital where they were treated for multiple stab wounds, however they have both since been discharged.

DS Tom Power said: "I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who lives in the area and may have captured the offenders on home CCTV or doorbell footage around the time of the offence."

Anyone with information is urged to contact us via our web-chat quoting CC-01112020-0046 or by calling 101. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
