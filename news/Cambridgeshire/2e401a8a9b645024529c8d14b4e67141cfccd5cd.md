A man who used social media to send his ex-partner threatening messages has been jailed.

Fation Kolgjini, 28, of High Road, Romford was sentenced to six months imprisonment at Cambridge Crown Court on Thursday (15 March) after previously pleading guilty to putting a person in fear of violence.

On 23 December last year he sent a video message to his ex-partner in Cambridge of a man loading a gun and told her it was 'just for her'.

He continued to send threatening messages, including threatening to throw acid at her, until February when she reported the incidents to police.

In interview Kolgjini initially claimed his ex-partner had sent the messages herself.

PC Luke Ephgrave said: "The victim in this case showed incredible courage to report these incidents to police. The custodial sentence highlights the seriousness of the threats and how domestic abuse is not tolerated by the police or the courts."

Kolgjini also received a 10 year restraining order preventing him from contacting the victim.
