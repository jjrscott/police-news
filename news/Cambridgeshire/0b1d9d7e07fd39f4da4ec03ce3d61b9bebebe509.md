We are appealing for witnesses following a serious collision in St Neots.

At about 8pm last night (7 April) a silver Volvo V90 and a silver Suzuki Vitara were in collision along the A428 between the Tesco and Wyboston Lakes roundabouts.

The driver of the Volvo, a man in his 40s, and the driver of the Suzuki, a man in his 20s, both suffered serious injuries and remain in a critical condition at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.

Anyone who witnessed the collision should call 101 quoting incident 447 of 7th April.
