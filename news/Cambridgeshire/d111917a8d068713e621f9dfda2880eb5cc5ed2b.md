A prisoner at HMP Peterborough has been sentenced after he poured a flask full of boiling water on a prison guard.

Stephen Shears, 28, launched the attack shortly after walking into the prison staff room at 8.30am on 13 June.

He walked up to the victim from behind and poured the scalding hot water on the officer's head and neck, causing burns which required hospital treatment.

Another officer sounded the alarm and Shears was instantly detained by prison officers.

When questioned, Shears claimed he was forced to carry out the attack by other inmates and if he didn't, he would have been targeted.

He pleaded guilty to causing actual bodily harm and was jailed for an additional 10 months today (19 November) at Peterborough Crown Court.

DC Graham Holmes said: "This was an unprovoked attack that has understandably left the victim shaken.

"Prison officers work hard day-in-day-out to keep order and protect inmates. They do not deserve to face violence of any level and I hope this sentence serves as a deterrent for other inmates considering violent actions."
