Detectives are appealing for information after an attempted raid on a cash machine in Fordham.

At about 1.30am today (Tuesday 9 January) the offenders used a silver BMW X3 to smash the brick work and window of a convenience store in Carter Street.

They then attempted to use a rope to drag a free standing ATM cash machine out of the building, but the rope snapped and the men fled the scene.

The offenders are believed to have left the scene in two other vehicles, leaving the silver BMW X3 behind.

Anyone with information regarding this incident should call police on 101 quoting CF0015500118 or visit www.cambs.police.uk/report. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
