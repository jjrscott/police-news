Speeding drivers across Huntingdonshire have been targeted during a 48 hour operation.

In total, officers from the St Neots neighbourhood policing team, the Road Policing Unit and Special Constabulary issued 93 speeding tickets and gave words of advice to a further 25 people about their driving.

The highest speed recorded was 51mph in a 30mph zone in Cromwell Road, Eynesbury.

Two tickets were also issued for driving while using a mobile phone and one driver has been reported for driving without due care and attention.

Between 4pm on Friday (4 September) and 4pm yesterday (6 September) officers dedicated their shifts to carrying out speed checks in St Neots, Eynesbury, Eaton Socon, Ellington, Grafham, Perry, Tilbrook, Great Gidding, Stonely, Colmworth, Catworth, Spaldwick, Stow Longa, Kimbolton, Great Paxton, Buckden, Toseland, the Offords, Abbotsley and Little Paxton.

PC Josh Ives from the St Neots neighbourhood team said: "After listening to concerns from the community about speeding and using our own knowledge we established a list of hotpots which we focused on over the weekend.

"We caught taxi drivers, delivery drivers and motorcyclists but the vast majority we ticketed or spoke to were residents of the villages where the concerns were from.

"Speeding is one of the contributions to avoidable collisions that result in death or serious injury

"It's simple, the faster you drive the less time you have to react and you are putting not only your life at risk but also the lives of others."
