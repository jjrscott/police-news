Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was seriously injured during a robbery in Fulbourn.

On Tuesday (30 January) at approximately 5.45pm, a woman was assaulted and robbed as she walked towards Tesco on Yarrow Road.

 As the victim, a woman in her late 50s, approached Tesco car park, the offender jumped out of the bushes and grabbed her handbag.

She punched the victim in the face as she pulled her handbag off her, causing the victim to fall.

The victim suffered serious but not life threatening injuries.

The offender is described as white, in her 30s, 5' 6-8", slim build with dark hair. She was wearing dark tight trousers (possibly jeans), a dark coat, blue pattern headscarf and trainers.

DC John Cox said: "This was a nasty incident which has left the victim with a number of injuries.

"We know there were a number of people who were in the area at the time of the robbery and would urge anyone with information to contact us."

Anyone with information regarding this incident should call police on 101 quoting CF0058630118 or visit www.cambs.police.uk/report. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
