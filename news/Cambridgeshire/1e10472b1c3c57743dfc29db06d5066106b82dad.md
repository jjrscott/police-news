Officers investigating a serious collision yesterday evening (12 December) in Trumpington High Street are appealing for witnesses.

At about 10.30pm a Ford Focus was involved in a collision with a cyclist. Representatives from the Ambulance Service attended the scene and the cyclist, a man in his 30s, was taken to hospital with serious injuries. His condition is described critical but stable.

Officers are particularly keen to speak to the driver of a white van who stopped at the scene to help the cyclist. No arrests have been made.

Sergeant Simon Goldsmith said: "This was a serious collision and it's important we gain a better understanding of what happened.

"We're appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision to get in touch as a matter of urgency."

Anyone with information regarding this collision should call police on 101 and ask to speak to a member of the Roads Policing Unit quoting CC-12122017-0502. Alternatively visit www.cambs.police.uk/report.
