A man has been handed 18 months in prison after he threatened a man with a knife on a Peterborough bus.

David Kinlan, 43, was travelling on a bus in Eastfield Road in September 2018 when he began arguing with another passenger, a man in his 20s.

The argument became heated and Kinlan pulled out a knife, threatening the man before getting off the bus.

He was arrested just over a month later in Bridge Street, Peterborough, after he was identified through CCTV images.

Yesterday (6 April) at Peterborough Crown Court Kinlan, of Medworth, Orton Goldhay, Peterborough, was sentenced after pleading guilty to threatening a person with a bladed article in a public place.

PC Bruce Hindmarsh said: "Kinlan escalated the argument to such a level that the victim feared his life was in danger.

"There is no excuse for carrying offensive weapons in public and we will continue to put those who do before the courts."

Anyone who knows someone who carries a knife or weapon can report it anonymously by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or visiting https://crimestoppers-uk.org/.
