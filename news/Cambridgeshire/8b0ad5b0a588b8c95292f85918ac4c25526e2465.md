Detectives have released CCTV images of a man they would like to speak to following a knifepoint robbery in Littleport.

Officers were alerted to the robbery by a member of staff who had pressed a panic alarm at One Stop in Wisbech Road at about 6.30pm yesterday (2 August).

The alarm was raised after a man entered the store and filled his pockets with scratch cards before threatening two members of staff, one woman in her 40s and another in her teens, with a knife and demanded cash.

The man fled the shop in the direction of Pont's Hill.

Detective Sergeant Emma Garwood, who is investigating, said: "This was an extremely distressing incident for the two shop workers.

"The man tried his best to cover his identity using somewhat of a distinctive hat.

"I would urge anybody who has any information about the incident, or saw a man wearing a similar looking hat in the area at the time, to get in touch as a matter of urgency."

Anyone with information should contact police either by speaking to a web-chat operator on our website www.cambs.police.uk/report quoting 35/51553/20 or, if you do not have access to a computer, by calling 101.
