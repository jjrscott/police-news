We are appealing for information after a man was left with serious injuries following an assault on Bank Holiday Monday (27 August).

At about 4am, the victim, a 24-year-old man, was in the alleyway between Tesco and O'Neill's in Broadway, when he was knocked unconscious in what appeared to be an unprovoked attack.

He was struck to the face, leaving him with several fractures and a broken jaw, and was taken to Peterborough City Hospital where he required extensive surgery.

The offender is described as a black or mixed race man with short dark afro hair and was wearing a light blue top with Adidas written on it.

We are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the assault and ask that you report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report quoting 35/25603/18 or call 101.
