A man has been arrested and charged following a raid on a home in Winstanley Court, Cambridge yesterday (30 April).

The warrant was carried out as part of a police operation to tackle serious street-based violence and knife crime in Cambridge and surrounding areas. During the warrant an amount of cannabis was found.

The man has since appeared in court charged with possessing cannabis, possessing criminal property and two counts of offering to supply class A drugs.

Sergeant Stuart Austin said: "This was a great start to our operation to tackle serious crime on our streets."
