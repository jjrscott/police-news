A man who killed two men after his lorry ploughed into their vehicle has been jailed.

Stephen Widdowson, 51, of Houghton le Spring, Tyne and Wear was sentenced to 16 months at Cambridge Crown Court on Friday (13 October) after previously pleading guilty to two charges of causing death by careless driving.

The court heard how Widdowson was driving a fully laden car transporter along the westbound carriageway of the A14 near Swavesey on 20 April last year when he collided into a white Ford Transit at speed.

The driver of the van, 31-year-old Jason Louis from Stilton and passenger Daniel Marshall, 37, from Hartford, both died at the scene.

PC Andy Ralph from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire investigation unit said: "This collision was completely avoidable had Widdowson paid proper attention to the road ahead.

"His actions on the day of the collision and the length of time it has taken for him to admit his responsibilities have caused great distress to the families of those who died and everyone involved."

Widdowson was given 16 months for each count of causing death by dangerous driving, to run concurrently. He was also disqualified from driving for two years and eight months.
