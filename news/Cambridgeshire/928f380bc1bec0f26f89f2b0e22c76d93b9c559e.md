A Cambridge shoplifter has been jailed for 18 weeks.

Between 19 May and 16 September Liam Basham stole items worth more than Â£950 from stores across the city.

He was caught on CCTV taking champagne, wine, jars of honey, electric toothbrushes, handbags and large quantities of meat and fish from stores including the Co-op on Perne Road and Milton Road, Tesco in Yarrow Road and TK Maxx in Market Street

At Cambridge Magistrates' Court on Tuesday, the 24-year-old of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to 10 counts of theft.

He was jailed for 16 weeks for the thefts and a further two for breaching a court order.

PC Floyd Matthews said: "Basham admitted all of the thefts as soon as he was arrested and claimed he did it to feed his drug habit. I hope his time in prison will allow him to get the help he needs."
