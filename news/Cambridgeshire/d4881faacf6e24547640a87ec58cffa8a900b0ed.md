Tributes have been paid to a father of three who died following a collision on the A11 on Friday (2 February).

Emergency services were called to the northbound carriageway of the A11 at Little Abington at about 6.50pm with reports of a collision involving a black Volkswagen Golf.

Sadly the driver of the vehicle, Adam Rahim, 37, of Brooks Road, Cambridge, died at the scene.

In a statement Mr Rahim's partner and family said: "Words cannot express the devastation that we feel from the loss of Adam.

"Adam was a fantastic father to our three children, a soul mate to his partner for many years and a loving son and brother. He was a sweet natured, gentle loving man who will be missed by everyone who knew him.

"The only consolation for us as a family is that Adam died doing something he loved, driving his car. As a family we ask to be left to grieve in private."

Anyone who witnessed the collision is asked to call the Road Policing Unit on 101 quoting incident 389 of 2 February.

Passed away: Adam Rahim
