Cambridge city centre officers are inviting shoppers, students and residents to join them for a cuppa.

The neighbourhood policing team are holding a series of 'coffee with a cop' events at cafes and bistros across the city in a bid to reach out to the community members they serve.

The first one will be held by PC Flemington and PCSO Thomas at Costa Coffee in Market Street on 23 November between 3pm and 4pm.

PC Flemington said: "Meeting in neutral locations will hopefully provide the opportunity for real conversations about issues affecting people. I hope people will come and sit down with us, have a chat over a drink, ask questions and share what's on their mind."
