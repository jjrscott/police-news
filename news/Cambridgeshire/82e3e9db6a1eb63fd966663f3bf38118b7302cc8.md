A woman who died following a collision involving three cars in Fulbourn on Friday (31 July) has been named by police.

The collision, involving a black Renault Clio, a grey Peugeot 308 and a black Volvo XC40 happened on Cambridge Road at about 11.29am.

Emergency services attended the scene however, the driver and sole occupant of the Clio, 50-year-old Katherine Farrow, known to loved ones as Cathie, of St Matthews Gardens, Cambridge, died at the scene.

The driver of the Peugeot, a man, suffered minor injuries and the passenger of the same car, a woman, suffered serious but non-life threatening injuries. Both were taken to Addenbrookes' Hospital in Cambridge.

In a tribute, Katherine's daughter, Charlotte, said: "She is the most beautiful women, inside and out. Words cannot express how different my life will be without my wonderful, supportive Mummy here by my side but I know she'll always be there in some way. Her amazing and witty personality will be truly missed by every one of us."
