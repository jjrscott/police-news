A man charged with assaulting three police officers has been remanded in prison following his first court appearance on Saturday (25 July).

We attended the home address of the 27-year-old in Millfield in the early hours of Friday morning (24 July) after receiving reports of violence.

Whilst at the address officers had a glass bottle thrown at them, were threatened with a wooden pole and one was pulled to the ground.

He was charged with three counts of assaulting an emergency worker by beating and appeared at Huntingdon Magistrates' Court on Saturday.

He has since been remanded in prison to appear at Cambridge Magistrates' Court on Thursday (30 July).
