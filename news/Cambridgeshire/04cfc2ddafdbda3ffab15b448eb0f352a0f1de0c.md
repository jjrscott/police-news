Cambridgeshire Constabulary has launched a new online form to help protect individuals from domestic abuse.

Members of the public can now apply for information about their partner's history of domestic abuse online via the force's website.

The Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme, also known as Clare's Law, is named after Clare Wood who was murdered in Salford in 2009 by her ex-boyfriend who had a history of violence against women.

The scheme allows individuals to ask police for information held on a person in relation to domestic abuse offences and convictions. The aim is to share information with individuals who may be at risk of harm in order to prevent them from becoming a victim of abuse.

As of yesterday (28 September), the process to apply for information under the disclosure scheme has been made easier by the launch of the new online form. The public now have this option rather than needing to call and apply through the 101 service.

The online form works in the same way as an application made over the phone and immediate disclosures will be made to individuals who are deemed to be at risk.

Detective Inspector Sherrie Nash said: "As a police force, it is vital that we change with the time and ensure we are making applications, such as this disclosure scheme, as easy and accessible as possible.

"While the option to apply for information via 101 is still there, we recognise that we are living in an ever-increasing digital world and many people would prefer to complete a simple online form than pick up the phone.

"Preventing and tackling domestic abuse is one of our main priorities and the Clare's Law disclosure scheme helps us share crucial information with people who may be at risk of harm.

"We work closely with applicants and ensure appropriate safeguarding is in place in order to prevent them from becoming a victim of domestic abuse.

"It is hoped that the form not only helps free up time for our 101 call handlers, but also encourages more people to apply for information about their partners criminal domestic abuse history which really could help save a life."

The new online form can be found here.
