A convicted paedophile has appeared in court after being found in possession of images of children.

Robert Walker, 53, was placed on the sex offenders register in March last year when he was convicted of making and being in possession of indecent images of children.

On 1 July last year, officers paid Walker a routine visit to his in address at the time in Green End, Landbeach.

During a search of his mobile phone, detectives found 46 prohibited images of children, which were mainly created from computer generated graphics. In his police interview, Walker said that viewing the images was "like an addiction."

On Tuesday (4 August), Walker, now of Denny End Road, Waterbeach, admitted to being in possession of prohibited images of children and was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for 18 months.

He was also handed a 15 year Sexual Harm Prevention Order.

DC Richard Newman said: "Despite his previous convictions, Walker continued to look at illegal material.

"Thanks to this sentence we will have the necessary powers to monitor his online activity minimising the risk of further harm to the public."
