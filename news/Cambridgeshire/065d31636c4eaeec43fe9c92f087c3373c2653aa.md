A man has died following a three-vehicle collision in Wansford yesterday (21 April).

At about 4pm, a red Renault Clio was travelling on the A47 when it was involved in a collision with a white Mazda 3SE and a silver Fiat Fullback.

Emergency services attended and attempted to provide first aid, but despite their best efforts, the driver of the Mazda, a man in his 70s, died at the scene.

A passenger in the Mazda was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital where they remain in serious but stable condition.

The driver of the Renault was also taken to hospital with serious, but not life threatening injuries. The driver of the Fiat was not injured.

Anyone who witnessed the vehicles driving prior to the collision, or who has dashcam footage of the collision, is asked to call 101, quoting incident 300 of 21 April. Alternatively, you can report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report.
