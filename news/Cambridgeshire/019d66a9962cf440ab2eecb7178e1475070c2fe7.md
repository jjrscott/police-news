A county lines drug dealer from Birmingham who took over a vulnerable man's home to sell heroin has been jailed.

Darren Spence, 19, was in the property in Rutland Close, Cambridge, when officers received information about suspected drug dealing on 19 July, 2017.

When officers entered the property they found 45 wraps of heroin worth £430 and £470 in cash. Before they left the area three people attempted to visit the property, two admitting they were there to buy drugs.

Spence had been staying at the man's flat in a practice known as "cuckooing", where the occupant is often tricked or coerced into letting a drug dealer stay at their home.

Spence, of Springfield Street, Birmingham, pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply heroin.

Today (21 June) at Cambridge Crown Court he was sentenced to two years and four months in prison.

PC Steve Girdlestone said: "Cuckooing is a despicable practice, which regularly involves the use of threatening behaviour or intimidation to prey on people with addictions.

"We're working hard to tackle county lines and other forms of dealing in Cambridge, which can be linked to other crimes such as burglary and violence.

"These substances destroy people's lives by trapping them in addiction, so it's vital we bring dealers before the courts."

County lines refers to the dedicated mobile phones, or "lines", used by criminals to deal drugs originating in London in other UK towns and cities.
