Police have made an arrest after a man was stabbed in Cambridge on Monday.

Officers were called to Coldhams Lane at 12.17pm following reports that a man was attacked by two men carrying knives.

The 29-year-old victim was taken to hospital with serious, but not life-threatening injuries and has since been released into the care of his family.

Police patrols in the area were increased following the attack and a 20-year-old man from Cambridge was arrested this morning on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent. He remains in custody at Parkside Police Station.

Detective Sergeant Graham Newton said: "We are treating this as an isolated incident and I would like to thank all of those who have come forward to support the investigation so far.

"We are particularly keen to speak to anyone who may have been driving in the area at the time of the attack and may have dash-cam footage of the incident, or moments leading up to it.

"We believe that another man may have been involved in this attack, so I would urge anyone with information to come forward so we can bring those responsible to justice."
