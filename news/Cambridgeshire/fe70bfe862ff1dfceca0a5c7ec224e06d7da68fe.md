A man who tried to steal a woman's shopping trolley before smashing her over the head with a brick has been sentenced.

Brandon Cliffe, of Pipe Lane in Peterborough, launched the attack on 30 July last year.

The woman, 69, was walking with the aid of her tartan shopping trolley along Padholme Road, Peterborough, at just before 7pm when she was approached from behind.

Cliffe, 20, grabbed the trolley but the woman managed to keep hold of it and a struggle ensued, Peterborough Crown Court heard.

Cliffe initially had hold of the trolley with two hands, but released one hand during the scuffle to grab a brick from the pavement.

He then smashed the woman over the head with the brick, which caused her to stumble forward with blood pouring from her head.

She began screaming and two teenagers rushed to her aid, managing to push Cliffe off her.

One of the two teenagers chased Cliffe, but lost him and returned to the woman's aid.

Police and paramedics were called and while waiting for them to arrive the teenagers spotted Cliffe hiding in some nearby bushes.

Officers searched the area and Cliffe was found but then ran from police and was seen to discard a blue hooded jumper.

After a short foot chase Cliffe was arrested in North Bank Road - about 50 metres away from where the attempted robbery took place.

The woman was taken to hospital where she required treatment for the cut to her head.

In police interview, Cliffe denied all knowledge of the offence and said he had spent most of the day drinking in a nearby underpass.

He denied any involvement in the attempted robbery itself and told officers he 'would not hurt an old woman'.

Cliffe was found guilty of attempted robbery and assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH) after standing trial at Peterborough Crown Court in January.

He was sentenced at the same court today (Friday, 15 February) where he was handed nine years in a young offenders institution.

The two teenagers who stopped to intervene were also praised by Judge Matthew Lowe for their bravery, and awarded Â£150 each.

DC Victoria Speirs said: "This was a vicious and unprovoked attack on a frail woman, and the outcome could have been so much worse.

"The two members of the public who intervened were very brave in trying to stop Cliffe, and I want to publicly thank them for the courage they showed.

"Cliffe was clearly ready to use any force necessary in an attempt to commit this robbery and the sentence handed down in this case reflects the severity of the crime."
