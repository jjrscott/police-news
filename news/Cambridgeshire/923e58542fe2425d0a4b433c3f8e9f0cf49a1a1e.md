Two Cambridge drug dealers have received suspended sentences.

Ebony Dean, 23, of Bermuda Road, Cambridge and Dominic Finn, 22, of no fixed address, were sentenced at Cambridge Crown Court last Friday (6 April).

In March last year officers were patrolling Bermuda Road following reports of drug dealing when they spotted Finn, who had been seen dealing the day before.

He ran off but officers found him with Dean in a property in Bermuda Road.

Finn had £270 in cash on him while Dean had six wraps of heroin, 11 wraps of crack cocaine, £750 cash and two mobile phones.

Dean initially denied the allegations but her phone contained drug dealing texts.

Both pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply class A drugs and were sentenced to two years imprisonment, suspended for two years.

Sergeant Paul Street said: "We have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to drugs.

"Drug offending is an issue our communities care about and one we will continue to focus on."
