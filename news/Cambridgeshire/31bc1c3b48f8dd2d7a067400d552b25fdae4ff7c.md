Two men have been jailed for running a cannabis factory from a car wash on the side of the A14.

Both men pleaded guilty to producing cannabis at a previous hearing.

A third man previously charged in connection with cannabis production was released with all charges dropped.

Officers received information that cannabis was being produced at the property, based on the eastbound side of the A14 close to Swavesey.

On 11 January went to the car wash and three men were arrested. Officers recovered more than 400 cannabis plants worth an estimated Â£300,000.

PC Ross Spalthoff said: "We believe these drugs were being produced to be sold in the county and have thankfully been able to prevent that from happening.

"We will continue to use every opportunity available to us to prevent drug production and dealing in Cambridgeshire and would urge anyone with information about drugs to report it."
