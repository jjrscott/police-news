A man has been arrested after officers carried out a warrant in South Cambridgeshire today (19 July).

Officers from the Southern Community Action Team (CAT) acted on intelligence to execute the warrant in Swavesey this afternoon.

Inside the property officers discovered various prohibited weapons.

A 53-year-old man from Swavesey has been arrested on suspicion of the improper importation of weapons subject to a prohibition.

He remains in custody at Parkside Police Station in Cambridge.

Today's warrant formed part of police action to tackle serious street based violence (SSBV) - a force priority introduced to address concerns over people carrying weapons in Cambridgeshire.

Alongside the warrant, officers also attended Cambridge Leisure Park where they spoke to the community about SSBV and the risks associated with possessing knives or offensive weapons in public.
