A bicycle thief who was caught in the act by CCTV operators has been sentenced.

Thomas Goodman, 21, was seen by CCTV operators acting suspiciously in Wentworth Street in Peterborough city centre on 30 August.

They watched him as he approached a bicycle and removed the rear wheel which was locking it in place, allowing him to carry the rest away.

Four days later, on 4 September, CCTV operators again saw Goodman in the city centre and alerted police of his whereabouts, resulting in his swift arrest.

In interview he admitted the offence and pleaded guilty to theft of a bicycle at Peterborough Magistrates' Court the same day.

Goodman, of Heacham, Kings Lynn, was sentenced to eight weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months and ordered to pay Â£350 in compensation to the victim.

PC Harry Howe, who investigated, said: "We take all reports of bike theft seriously and would encourage people to report offences so we can build up a picture and deploy resources accordingly.

"We would also encourage cyclists to take precautionary steps to reduce the risk of becoming a victim."
