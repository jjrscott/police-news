A man who carried a 6" kitchen knife for protection has been sentenced.

Stephen Barker, 54, of Rustat Close, Cambridge was on East Road on 10 April when he was seen by a member of the public taking a knife from his rucksack.

The witness called police and within three minutes Barker was located and searched.

He admitted carrying the knife and said he intended to use it as protection as he had been previously threatened.

At Cambridge Magistrates' Court on Tuesday (11 August), Barker was sentenced to four months in prison, suspended for two years after previously pleading guilty to possession of a knife in a public place. He must also undergo a rehabilitation activity requirement.

Special Sergeant Stephen Mudie said: "There is no excuse for carrying a knife in public. Tackling serious street-based violence is a priority and we will continue to do all we can to take as many offensive weapons off the streets of Cambridgeshire as possible."
