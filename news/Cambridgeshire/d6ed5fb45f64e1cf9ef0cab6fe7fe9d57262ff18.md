A takeaway delivery driver was robbed at knifepoint in Peterborough last night (25 February).

The robbery, which took place in Holdfield, Ravensthorpe, just before 10pm, has led to a police appeal for witnesses.

The man, who is in his 40s, was delivering food to a house when the occupants told him they had not ordered anything.

He returned to his car, a black Peugeot, but was approached by two men armed with knives.

He was threatened with the weapons, and handed over about Â£180 in cash, but was uninjured.

The two men had left the scene by the time officers arrived and they have not been identified. An investigation has been launched.

Detective Inspector Tim Archer said: "This was no doubt a very frightening incident for the delivery driver who was just doing his job.

"We are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious in the area at the time."
