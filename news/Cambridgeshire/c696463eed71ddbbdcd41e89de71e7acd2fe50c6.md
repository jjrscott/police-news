We have released CCTV images of the moment two men in monkey masks robbed a shop in Walpole Road, Cambridge armed with an axe and knife.

The pair entered the shop at about 5pm on Tuesday (23 October), demanding cash. A worker refused and the pair instead made off with three bottles of alcohol worth more than Â£70.

DC John Cox said: "This was a terrifying ordeal for the shop worker and for members of the public in the area at the time.

"I would urge anybody who recognises those pictures to get in touch as a matter of urgency."

Anyone who recognises the men or has any information regarding this incident should call police on 101 quoting 35/39830/18 or contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
