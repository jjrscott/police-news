A dispersal order is being put in place in an area of Cambridge city this weekend.

The measure has been taken by the local policing team in response to groups of people gathering at the Leisure Park, causing violence, disorder and anti-social behaviour.

The order is in effect from 3pm today (6 March) until 11.59pm on Sunday (7 March) and covers the area of the Leisure Park itself and the vicinity.

Cambridge City Inspector Ed McNeil said: "In recent weeks we've seen an increase in anti-social behaviour and reports of violence within the area with people gathering in groups.

"The dispersal order will enable those causing the anti-social behaviour to be dispersed from the area with immediate effect and not to return within a specific period.

"We're also working alongside local businesses to address the issues."

The order has been granted under Section 34 of the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014, and allows for Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs) and police officers to direct a person to leave the area specified within the order if they have reasonable grounds to suspect that their behaviour has caused, or is likely to cause, harassment, alarm or distress to members of the public. Failure to comply with the order can result in arrest.
