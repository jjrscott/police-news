Police have issued an appeal after two robberies at Orton Lock in Peterborough yesterday (14 May).

The first happened just before 5pm when two boys and a girl attacked a man, stealing his bicycle and threatening to stab him.

The main attacker was described as a boy of about 16 years old, white, short light brown hair and wearing grey joggers, grey jacket and a white top underneath.

The girl was described as also being about 16 years old, having light brown skin, an afro hairstyle tied up in a ball and wearing a green puffy coat, with fur at the top, and white shoes.

The second robbery happened at 9.30pm when another man was cycling through Orton Lock towards the boating lake.

A group of six to eight men stood in the middle of the path and pushed him to the ground. His distinctive green Rockhopper bicycle was stolen and the group, who a witness described as Asian, beat him causing deep cuts that required hospital treatment.

Officers believe the two incidents are linked and ask that anyone who witnessed them or has private CCTV on routes into or out of the area to contact police on 101 and quote 35/31458/20.
