Police uncovered a haul of cannabis plants over the weekend.

Officers from the East Neighbourhood Policing Team swooped on two locations in School Road, Saxon Street and in a field close to the River Cam between Wicken and Streatham on Saturday.

In Saxon Street they recovered ten plants and in the field they found a trailer parked up containing 44 plants. An investigation is ongoing.

PC Ciaran Constable said: "We seized more than 50 cannabis plants as well as cash and dried cannabis ready for sale during the warrants on Saturday.

"Thanks to intelligence received from members of the community we were able to disrupt these drug dealers and the associated crime they bring to our area."

Members of the public are asked to report drug usage or dealing by calling 101 or online
