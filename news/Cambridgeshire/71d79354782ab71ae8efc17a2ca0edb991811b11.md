Police have named a woman who died in a collision in Black Drove, Murrow, yesterday morning (9 November).

Jade Green, 24, of Beechwood Road, Wisbech, died when the Vauxhall Astra she was driving was involved in a collision with a Ford Transit at 7.10am.

Two passengers in the vehicle, a man and a woman, were taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge and remain in a critical but stable condition. The driver of the van, a man, suffered minor injuries.

Officers investigating the collision are appealing for information to trace a fourth person who was believed to be in the vehicle, but left the scene. The man is described as white, in his 20s, with dark curly hair and a beard.

In a statement Jade's family said: "Jade was a much loved sister and daughter. She will be sadly missed by all who knew her."

Anyone with information about the collision or the man's identity is asked to call the Road Policing Unit on 101 quoting incident 73 of 9 November, or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111.
