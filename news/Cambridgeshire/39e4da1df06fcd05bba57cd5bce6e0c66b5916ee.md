A man who stole detergent from a shop and threatened staff with a knife has been jailed.

Scott Ellis, 34, entered the Spar shop in Welland Road, Peterborough, at just before 4.10pm on 16 September.

He walked around the shop and then loaded his coat with bottles of detergent.

When a staff member witnessed what he was doing, she alerted other colleagues and ran to the entrance to hold the door shut in an attempt to stop Ellis from leaving with the items without paying.

When Ellis tried to push her away, other shop workers intervened and detained him before alerting police.

At this point, Ellis has responded by producing a knife and threatening to stab the staff.

Out of fear for the safety of themselves and the other customers, the staff let Ellis leave the shop. He continued to brandish the knife and threaten the staff workers inside, before cycling off with three bottles of detergent.

Ellis, of no fixed abode, was arrested on 21 January and pleaded guilty to theft from a shop and threatening a person with a bladed article.

Yesterday (3 June) at Peterborough Crown Court he was jailed for 15 months.

DC Natalie Hines said: "This was a terrifying ordeal, that took place in the middle of the afternoon in the presence of children, all for the sake of some detergent.

"Ellis' violent actions were totally unacceptable and it's sheer luck that no one was seriously injured.

"I hope his time behind bars gives him the opportunity to reflect on his dangerous behaviour."
