Detectives investigating the rape of a teenage girl in Peterborough last week have charged a man.

The 39-year-old was arrested on Friday afternoon (11 September) in connection with the rape in Millfield.

A report was made to us just after 10pm on Tuesday, 8 September, after a 17-year-old girl was sexually assaulted near to the Alternative Curriculum Education Centre in Lincoln Road.

DI Dan Pawson said: "From CCTV enquiries we believe there were two people in the area at the time of the incident who may be vital witnesses.

"I would urge anyone who was in the Millfield area of Lincoln Road around 9.30pm on Tuesday, 8 September, to get in touch with us."

The man appeared at Peterborough Magistrates' Court yesterday (Monday 14 September) where he was remanded in custody for his next appearance at Peterborough Crown Court on 12 October.

Anyone with information should contact police either by using the online webchat function, or by calling 101 and quoting Operation Trundle.
