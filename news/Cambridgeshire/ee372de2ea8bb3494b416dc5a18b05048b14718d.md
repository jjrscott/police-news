A man has been taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries after a stabbing in Wisbech in the early hours of this morning (8 September).

Officers were called to reports of violence on Norwich Road just after 1am. They attended the scene, together with paramedics, where they discovered a man had been stabbed in the leg.

The man, in his 20s from Wisbech, was taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries where he remains this morning in a critical condition.

It is believed he was approached and attacked by a man described as black, 5'8", of skinny build and in his mid-20s. The man was wearing a hooded top and dark clothing at the time.
