Police are appealing for information following a collision on Tuesday between Fowlmere and Newton.

A refuse lorry carrying a driver and two passengers was travelling along Cambridge Road at about 11.30am when it rolled onto its side, throwing the driver and one of the front seat passengers from the vehicle.

Two men were taken to Addenbrooke's hospital with serious, but not life threatening injuries.

A third man, who remained in the overturned vehicle, was taken to the same hospital with minor injuries.

Anyone who witnessed the collision or believe they saw the HGV prior to the collision should call police on 101 quoting incident 161 of 19 March. Alternatively you can report online by visiting www.cambs.police.uk/report
