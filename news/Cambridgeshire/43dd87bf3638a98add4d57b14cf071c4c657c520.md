Police are urging members of the public to get in contact if they have been the victims of distraction burglars in Peterborough.

A report was received yesterday (18 May) that a 73-year-old man had more than Â£1000 in cash stolen from his home in Eye after scrap metal collectors had visited his home.

The offenders, two men, had previously visited the victim's home in Crowland Road to collect and dispose of scrap metal, while there it is believed they had seen where the victim kept his money.

On their second visit to his home, one of the men took the victim into the garden to discuss any other work he would like doing, while his accomplice went into the house and stole the cash.

One of the men is described as white, aged in his late 40s, short, bald and wore jeans. The other was tall and aged in his 20s, both had English accents and drove a black 4x4 which had tinted windows.

Detectives from the Burglary Team said: "We are looking to identify those responsible. Any information however small will assist the Police. We are keen to review any CCTV and Dash Camera footage. Burglary is an extremely impactive crime, anyone with information is urged to get in touch."

Anyone with information should call police on 101 quoting 35/32235/20 or report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report.

If you are not expecting any visitors to your home, do not let them in. More advice can be found on the force website here https://www.cambs.police.uk/A-Z/Bogus-callers
