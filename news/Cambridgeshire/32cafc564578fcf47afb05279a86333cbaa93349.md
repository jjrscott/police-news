We have released an image of a man we want to speak to in connection with a burglary in Cottenham.

The burglary took place at an address on Lambs Lane on Saturday (19 January).

There are believed to have been three burglars involved and a black Audi Q5 was used in the incident. Among the items taken was a safe and some jewellery.

Anyone who thinks they may know who this man is should call the police on 101 quoting 35/4531/19.

Do you recognise this man?
