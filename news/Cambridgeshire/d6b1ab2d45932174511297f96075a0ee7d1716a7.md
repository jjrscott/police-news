A teenager who stole a man's bike at knifepoint has been sentenced to four years in a young offenders institute.

Bradley Plavecz, 18, met the 19 year old, who was with a 17-year-old friend, on the Welland estate, in Dogsthorpe, Peterborough, at about 10.30pm on 31 January last year.

He knew the man and asked to borrow his bike but was refused.

Plavecz produced a knife from his waistband and pointed it threateningly at the victim before taking the bike.

He rode it towards Eye but police had been called and after a brief chase he was arrested in Eye Road. Officers discovered six bags of cannabis on him and the bicycle was returned to the victim the same evening.

Plavecz, of Hercules Way, Peterborough, was sentenced at Peterborough Crown Court yesterday (15 July) after pleading guilty to possession of a class B drug, robbery and possession of a knife.

DC Adam Blake said: "Plavecz knew exactly what he was doing on this evening but thanks to the victim reporting the crime so quickly we managed to make a quick arrest and return the stolen bike."
