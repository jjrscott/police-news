We are appealing for the public's help in identifying two people we would like to speak to in connection with frauds in Cambridge.

On two occasions over the past month officers have been made aware of shoppers at Waitrose in Hauxton Road having their purses taken from their cars.

On 5 February a woman in her 80s was approached by a woman while at the back of her car. When she got home she noticed her purse was missing and, after speaking with her bank, was told £1,600 had been spent on her card at the Apple Store in the Grand Arcade and a further £1,600 in cash had been withdrawn.

On 24 February a woman in her 70s was contacted by her bank after her card was used in a fraudulent transaction worth £2,500 at John Lewis in the Grand Arcade, as well as to withdraw £1,160 in cash. Her card is believed to have been stolen while she was returning a trolley at the supermarket two days previous.

PC Louise Wick, who is investigating, said: "The victims of these frauds have had a substantial amount of hard-earned money taken from them.

"I am appealing for anyone who recognises those pictured to get in touch."

Anyone with information should call police on 101 quoting 35/13911/20 or report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report.
