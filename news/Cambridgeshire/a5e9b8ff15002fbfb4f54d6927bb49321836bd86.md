Police have released CCTV images of two men they would like to speak to following a series of robberies in Cambridge City Centre last Wednesday (17 July).

Over a nine hour period, there were eight reported incidents in which two men riding a moped are said to have snatched bags from women who were cycling through the city.

In some cases, the victims were reportedly pushed to the ground, causing minor injuries.

DS Jo Grant said: "Please be vigilant when cycling alone and make sure that your personal belongings are secure.

"Devices such as anti-theft or personal attack alarms can help to deter thieves while also alerting others to the incident."

Anyone who knows who these men are, or anybody who witnessed the incidents take place should call police on 101 quoting incident: 35/50838/19 or report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report
