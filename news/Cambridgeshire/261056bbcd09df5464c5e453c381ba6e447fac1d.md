We are appealing for information after a van driver was robbed by four men on mopeds in Glinton on Wednesday morning (8 July).

The 45-year-old victim was driving his white works van on the A15 at about 8am after leaving the fuel station.

He noticed a moped flashing its lights behind him so pulled to one side to let it through when it started to slow in front of him.

A second moped then approached from behind and began hitting the van with a police-style baton in an attempt to make the driver pull over.

The victim stopped in a layby and got out the van when one of the men on the mopeds, described as having a 'scouse' accent, beat him with the baton and made demands for him to hand over the keys to the van.

After a struggle four men made off empty handed on two mopeds, neither of which displayed number plates.

Anyone with information should contact police either by calling 101 or report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report and quote 35/44806/20.
