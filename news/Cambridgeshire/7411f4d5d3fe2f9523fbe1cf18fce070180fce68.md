We are appealing for information after an allotment in Peterborough was targeted by thieves last night (Tuesday 17 November).

A hole was cut in the wire fencing to access the allotment in Weslyan Road, Dogsthorpe, at about 10pm.

Tools and a fridge were stolen from one of the sheds, and the tea room was also broken into by the offenders.

Anyone with information about the incident, or who may have seen suspicious activity in the area at the time, is urged to contact us online either at www.cambs.police.uk/report, or using the online web chat function and quoting incident 506 of 17 November. Those who do not have access to the internet shall call 101.
