A man who threatened to shoot his partner and "get rid" of her body because she wouldn't get him his cigarettes has been jailed.

David Cheetham, 34, and his partner went to visit her cousin in Wisbech on 16 December. Cheetham waited in the car while she went inside to pick something up.

When she came out, Cheetham shouted profanities at her and drove off.

The victim walked back to their home in Osborne Road to find Cheetham who demanded she get his cigarettes from the car for him.

When she refused to do so, Cheetham said "if you don't, I will shoot you and get rid of your body."

The victim knew Cheetham had a firearm as he had waved it in her face and threatened to kill her with it during previous arguments. Fearing for her life, the victim contacted the police.

Cheetham was arrested and a police search of his vehicle recovered a hand gun, which was found to be a blank firing gun with blank ammunition.

Cheetham, of Osborne Road, Wisbech, was found guilty of possession of an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence at Peterborough Crown Court on Friday (17 July). He was sentenced to one year and eight months in prison and handed an indefinite restraining order.

Detective Constable, Marc Bates, who investigated, said: "The victim in this case had been subjected to violent outbursts from Cheetham which left her extremely distressed and upset.

"He terrified her with the threats he made and seemed to get pleasure from inciting that fear.

"I am glad justice has been done for the victim, and I encourage anyone living with domestic abuse to come forward."
