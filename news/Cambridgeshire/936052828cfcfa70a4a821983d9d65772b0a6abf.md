We are warning members of the public following three instances of thefts from vans in the Fenland area.

Overnight on 3 November into 4 November, three vans were targeted by thieves where a hole was cut next to the locking mechanism to gain access and power tools stolen.

The offences took place in Teal Road and Feldale Place both in Whittlesey and High Road in Elm.

Where possible, it is advised tools are not left in vehicles which are unoccupied as vehicles such as vans are commonly targeted by criminals.

Particularly at the moment when more people might not be in work or working as often due to the current pandemic, people are urged to empty vans.

Advice on how to best protect your vehicle from thieves can be found on the force website here https://bit.ly/2UpM8So.

Members of the public are strongly urged to report any suspicious activity to us, including any information about these three thefts. This can be done online either through the reporting form at www.cambs.police.uk/report, via the web-chat function with an online operator, or by calling 101 if you don't have access to the internet. Always dial 999 if you believe a crime is in action.
