A man has been charged with drink driving after being involved in a minor collision in Bretton yesterday evening (Monday 1 February).

The 38-year-old was arrested in Bretton Gate just after 5pm after we attended a damage-only collision and suspected he had been drinking.

He has since been charged with drink driving, having 98 microgrammes of alcohol in 100ml of breath - the legal limit is 35.

He has been bailed to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on 24 March.

Information about the law, dangers and reporting of drink driving can be found on our drink driving advice page on our website.
