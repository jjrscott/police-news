A teenager from Kent who visited Cambridge to deal crack cocaine and heroin has been jailed.

Jordan Fowling, 18, was stopped by officers on patrol as he got into a vehicle with two other men on 20 July in Brooks Road.

All three men were searched. Officers discovered Fowling, of Lynmere Road, in Welling, had 150 wraps containing crack cocaine and heroin.

He admitted possession of crack cocaine and heroin with intent to supply. The other men were released without charge.

Today (22 August) at Cambridge Crown Court Fowling was sentenced to a year and eight months in prison.

PC Daniella Lewis said: "Drugs ruin lives and we will continue to pursue those who supply them in the county.

"I hope this and other recent court results send a message that we will not tolerate people visiting Cambridge for the purpose of selling drugs."
