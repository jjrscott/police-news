A man has been given a conditional caution following a racist incident in Cambridge.

The 58-year-old from Cambridge came forward after images of him were released on Cambridgeshire Constabulary's Policing Cambridge City Facebook page.

He admitted being verbally abusive to a member of staff outside Aldi in Histon Road on 8 February and apologised for his behaviour.

The man has now been dealt with by police by way of a conditional caution which includes attending an appointment to address his behaviour and paying Â£100 in compensation to the victim.

PC Alex Thomas from the Cambridge City North Neighbourhood Policing Team said: "The offender has shown complete remorse for his actions and therefore a conditional caution was deemed to be the appropriate course of action.

"We don't tolerate hate crime in our city and urge anyone who has been a victim to come forward and report it."
