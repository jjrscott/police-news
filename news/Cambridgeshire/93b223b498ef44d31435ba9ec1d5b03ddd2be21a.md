Police are urging Cambridge residents, particularly those living in flats, to be extra vigilant following a spate of burglaries.

There's been a rise in the number of burglaries across the city over the past two months and officers are reminding residents to check their windows and doors are secure when they leave their home and their locks are in full working order.

Those who live in a building with communal access are advised to challenge anyone who is not a resident or should not be in the block, if they feel safe to do so, or make a note of their appearance.

Detective Sergeant James Rabbett, who is investigating, said: "We've seen a rise in burglaries across the north and south of the city, with more than 40 similar incidents over the past two months.

"It seems that flats and apartments, particularly those with communal access points and trade buttons are being targeted. The break-ins tend to happen during the day when people are out at work.

"We are doing all we can to investigate these incidents and bring those responsible to justice and are increasing patrols in the area. However, we are also urging residents to be extra vigilant with their home security when they are out, and to report any suspicious activity to police by calling 101 or via the website www.cambs.police.uk/report/Crime."
