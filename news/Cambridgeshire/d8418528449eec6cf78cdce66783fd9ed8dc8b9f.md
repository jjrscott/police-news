Police are appealing for witnesses following reports of a suspicious incident in Peterborough on Tuesday 17 July.

â€‹Officers were called to reports of a man driving a 06 registered blue Seat and pulling over members of the public at around 8pm in Bretton Gate.

The car was fitted with blue lights in the windscreen and the driver is described as wearing black trousers, a white shirt, black tie and a high visibility jacket.

PC Stuart Appleton said: "We are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen this man pulling drivers over and would like to speak to an Audi driver we believe the man stopped.

"It is concerning that someone may be imitating a police officer and we are keen to establish the facts around this incident."

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101.
