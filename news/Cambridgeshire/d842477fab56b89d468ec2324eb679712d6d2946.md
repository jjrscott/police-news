Police are appealing for information from members of the public following reports of two separate suspicious incidents in Eye.

Both reports are of a man in a large white van, one on Thursday (22 October) at about 5.15pm when a man is reported to have asked a five-year-old boy to go with him in his van outside Boots chemist in the high street.

The other is reported to have happened at about 9.30am the same morning (Thursday) where a man got out of a van and approached a three-year-old girl in Eyebury Road.

DI Claire Hewson said: "We are aware of concerns spreading on social media and would like to reassure people that we are investigating these reports and have got officers on patrol in the area.

"I am asking for the public's help in identifying the owner of a van we have captured on CCTV, as well as reporting any further incidents or concerns."

Anyone with information about the van or suspicious activity is asked to contact police either via the online web-chat service, or by calling 101 and quoting CC-22102020-0391 **.**
