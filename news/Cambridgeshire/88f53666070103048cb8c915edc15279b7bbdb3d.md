A man has been jailed after forcing his way into an elderly woman's home and assaulting her in a drunken rage.

Jordan Hurst, 23, was heard trying to break into the woman's home in Egerton Close, Cambridge, at just after 1am on 7 January.

The woman, who is in her 70s, leant out of a window and told him to leave, to which Hurst screamed "fix me something to eat" and continued trying to break in.

As the woman was on the phone to police Hurst barged his way through her front door and made his way up to her bedroom, where he snatched her phone and threw it across the room.

He fled after the victim complained of chest pain, but was arrested a short while later in Howard Close. Officers described him as being intoxicated due to his demeanour following arrest.

Hurst, of no fixed abode, was jailed for 16 weeks at Cambridge Crown Court on Thursday (2 July) after pleading guilty to using violence to secure entry, criminal damage and common assault.

DC Dan Harper, who investigated, said: "This was a terrifying ordeal for the victim, who up until that night didn't know Hurst.

"He left the woman feeling vulnerable in her own home, a place where she should feel safest."
