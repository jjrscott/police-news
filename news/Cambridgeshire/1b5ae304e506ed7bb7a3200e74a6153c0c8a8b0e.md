A burglar has been jailed days after breaking into two Cambridge businesses.

Thomas Smith, 45, was seen trying to smash a window at a grocery shop in Magdalene Street at about 11.20pm on Tuesday night (2 June).

Despite being confronted by a member of the public, Smith continued his attempts to get inside but fled before police arrived.

About an hour later CCTV operators in the city centre contacted police after spotting a man breaking into Franco Manca in Market Hill.

Smith was inside the property for around a minute but, just as he was leaving, officers arrived and arrested him.

Smith, of no fixed abode, was jailed for 32 weeks yesterday (4 June) at Cambridge Magistrates' Court after pleading guilty to two counts of burglary.

DC Joseph Fourie, who investigated, said: "Burglary can have a devastating impact on victims, which is why tackling it is a priority for the force.

"We are working hard every day to put offenders before the courts."
