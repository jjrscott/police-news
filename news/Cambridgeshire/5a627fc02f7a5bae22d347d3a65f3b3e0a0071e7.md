A man who made and shared indecent videos of children has been handed a suspended sentence.

Vincent Paran, 25, from Cambridge, was given 20 months imprisonment, suspended for two years, at Cambridge Crown Court today (5 April) after previously pleading guilty to one count of making indecent videos of children and one count of distributing indecent videos of children.

The court heard how the Paedophile Online Investigation Team (POLIT) were alerted by a third party that Paran had shared an indecent video to a private Facebook group in the summer of last year.

A warrant was obtained for his arrest and his mobile phone and laptop were seized which were found to contain eight category A indecent videos which are the most severe.

Paran claimed he saved the videos because they looked 'unusual' and later uploaded them to a Facebook group used to share pornography.

DC Craig Doyle said: "Children are victimised not only when they are abused and an image or video is first taken, they are victimised repeatedly every time offenders like Paran view or share indecent content."

Paran was also given a sexual harm prevention order (SHPO) for five years and put on the Sex Offenders Register for 10 years.
