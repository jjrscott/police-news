Police are investigating a burglary in which two men broke into a home and threatened a woman with a crowbar.

The house in Church Street, Northborough, was broken into between 3pm and 4.30pm on Monday (19 October).

The intruders used a crowbar to force entry through the back gate and back door of the property.

The victim returned home while the men were inside and they threatened her with a crowbar before leaving and getting into a Sokda Octavia.

The victim was uninjured but very shaken. It's believed some items of jewellery were taken.

Detective Sergeant, Justin Parr, who is investigating, said: "This was a particularly scary experience for the victim and it has left her very shaken.

"We are following all investigative leads and are keen to catch the offenders.

"If you were in the area and saw anything suspicious or live nearby and have CCTV or dash cam footage, please contact police."
