Police have released CCTV images of a woman they would like to speak to in connection to an attempted fraud in Church Drove, Outwell.

On Monday, 29 October, a person attempted to use a bank card which had been stolen earlier that day in a distraction burglary of an 88-year-old woman in Wisbech.

PC Tom Adams said: "Fortunately the victim acted fast and instantly cancelled her bank cards. I would urge anyone with information to call us as soon as possible to prevent this from happening to anyone else."

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 quoting 35/41072/18. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or visit www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
