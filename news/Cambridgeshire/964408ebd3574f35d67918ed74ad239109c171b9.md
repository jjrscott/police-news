A teenager has been jailed after threatening to shoot two women in a Peterborough park.

Logan Cook, 19, had been drinking vodka and smoking cannabis when he arrived at Welland Field in November last year.

He approached two women, both in their 20s, at about 8pm and ordered them to give him cigarettes.

The women froze in fear as Cook brandished what appeared to be a gun while shouting his demands.

A family walked by and Cook turned to the two women and shouted, 'who's that', before claiming he would open fire.

The women saw an opportunity to flee and ran from the park before calling police.

Cook, of Robert Avenue, Peterborough, was arrested the following day and later admitted possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.

He was sentenced to 18 months detention in a youth offenders institute on Tuesday (8 December) at Cambridge Crown Court.

DC Leeza Phillips said: "Nobody should face this type of emotional trauma, for no good reason.

"Cook caused his victims a great deal of fear and I hope this sentence will force him to think twice before acting so recklessly in future."

The Government has recently launched a scheme that allows members of the public to surrender illegal weapons. Find out more here.
