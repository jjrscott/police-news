Officers investigating two robberies in Cambridge are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

The first incident involved a 63-year-old woman and took place outside Boots pharmacy in Chesterton Road at about 3.30pm on Tuesday 11 December.

The second incident involved an 81-year-old woman and took place in Mitcham's Corner in Milton Road at about 4pm on Monday (17 December).

On both occasions a male offender stole the victims' handbag, struggling with them and knocking them to the ground in the process.

DC Susan Burberry said: "These were frightening ordeals for the victims who have been left shaken by what happened. I would urge anyone who knows who is responsible, or witnessed the incidents, to contact us.

"At this stage we are keeping an open mind as to whether the same person is responsible for both offences."

Anyone with information is asked to contact police by reporting online at www.cambs.police.uk/report or call us on 101 and quote 35/51573/18 for the incident on 11 December, and 35/52929/18 for the incident on 17 December.
