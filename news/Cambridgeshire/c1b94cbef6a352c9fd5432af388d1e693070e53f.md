Police are appealing for information after a teenager was stabbed in Paston, Peterborough.

The 16-year-old boy was walking along the footpath between Crabtree and The Sheepwalk at about 7pm yesterday (11 February) when he was approached by a group of three men who were all dressed in black and wearing face coverings.

The boy was taken to Peterborough City Hospital where he was treated for stab wounds. He has since been discharged.

Detective Inspector Shishminder Thind said: "I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who lives in the area and may have captured the offenders on home CCTV or doorbell footage around the time of the offence."
