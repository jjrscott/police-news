Young people in Cambridge are being urged to continue to follow the current Covid guidelines.

Cambridgeshire Constabulary has issued the plea in conjunction with Cambridgeshire County Council following a number of incidents over the weekend where people were reported gathering in large groups in Parker's Piece, Midsummer Common and Jesus Green.

As a result, patrols have increased across the city and green spaces to encourage people to follow the rule of six.

Superintendent James Sutherland, area commander for the south of Cambridgeshire, said: "Our message throughout this pandemic remains the same that this is about personal responsibility.

"While the majority of people are acting responsibly, there are a few who are choosing to ignore the guidance and causing disruption for the local community.

"The rules are very clear that no more than six people can be together inside or outside and we urge everyone, for the sake of the health of their families and friends, to continue to follow the law."

Director of Public Health for Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, Dr Liz Robin added: "We know how much young people have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and the national lockdown and that many are concerned by its effect on their education, job prospects and social life, as well as their mental health and well-being.

"Unfortunately, if young people don't follow the Covid-19 rules this will result in the virus spreading more quickly in our area - increasing the risk of a local lockdown which would make the impact of the pandemic on young people even worse."
