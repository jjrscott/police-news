Do you recognise this man? Police would like to speak to him in connection with an incident in which more than Â£5,000 worth of damage was caused to a door in Peterborough.

At 7.25pm on 12 August, a man got out of a taxi in the car park of IGO4, an insurance company office in Staniland Way, Werrington. The outer doors were locked and the man tried to force his way in by kicking and pulling at the door, which shattered the glass.
