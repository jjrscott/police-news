Can you help us? We're appealing for information following a single-vehicle crash on Bourges Boulevard on Thursday (19 November).

At just before 2.30pm, we received reports of a collision involving a black Volkswagen.

It was reported the car lost control and veered onto the opposite side of the road before crashing into trees.

The driver of the Volkswagen, a man, was taken to Peterborough City Hospital with minor injuries.

We are appealing for anyone who witnessed the crash, or with dashcam footage, to get in touch.

Anyone with information should contact us on 101 or online at cambs.police.uk/report quoting incident 250 of 19 November.
