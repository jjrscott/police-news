Officers are appealing for information after an attempted robbery in Cambridge and have released images of a man they want to speak to in connection with the incident.

Police were called at 1.22pm last Friday (20 September) to the Spar store in Chesterton Road with reports of a robbery.

A man entered the store and threatened staff. He demanded money from the till and safe, but staff refused and said the tills could not be opened.

The man then dragged a member of staff to the till area of the store, before leaving empty handed and saying the incident was 'only a joke'.

He is thought to have left the shop and continued down De Freville Avenue.

DC Chris Street said: "This was no doubt a very frightening incident for staff at the store.

"The area was likely to have been busy at the time and if anyone saw anything suspicious, no matter how small, I'd urge them to get in touch."

An investigation has been launched and officers have now released CCTV images of a man they want to speak to in connection with the attempted robbery.

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting 35/67481/19, or visit www.cambs.police.uk/report.

Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
