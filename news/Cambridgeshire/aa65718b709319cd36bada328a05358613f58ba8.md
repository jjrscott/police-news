A violent man who left his victim with serious facial injuries has been jailed for 21 months.

Richard Cousins, 26, of Austin Drive, Trumpington, was sentenced today at Cambridge Crown Court after pleading guilty to inflicting Grievous Bodily Harm (GBH).

The court heard that the assault occurred shortly after the victim, a 23-year-old man from Newmarket, entered the Black Bull Pub in Sawston looking for Cousins on 18 March (2018) at around 10pm.

Cousins, who was in the pub, approached the victim, irate and with clenched fists, shouting in a threatening manner before punching him once to the left side of his face. The victim was then escorted out of the pub as Cousins was restrained by onlookers.

Two days later the victim went to hospital and was treated for a fractured cheek bone and eye socket, requiring surgery.

Sergeant Alice Draper said: "This sentence reflects the serious nature of the assault, which has understandably left the victim shaken.

"It is fortunate that others intervened to prevent further injury. Thankfully this sentence will ensure that Cousins is not able to harm others."
