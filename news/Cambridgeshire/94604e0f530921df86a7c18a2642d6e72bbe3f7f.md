A man who died following a collision involving a car and an HGV on the B1040, at the junction with Wheatsheaf Road and Bluntisham Heath Road, on Thursday (22 October) has been named.

Officers and paramedics attended at about 5.15pm. The driver of the car, John Burton, 72, of Spring Close, Huntingdon, was taken to hospital but later died from his injuries.

The circumstances of the collision are being investigated. Anyone who witnessed the collision should call 101 or visit www.cambs.police.uk/report quoting incident 339 of 22 October.

In a statement, John's family said: "John was born to a French mother and English father and spent his early years living in France before moving to London and finally to Huntingdon in 1964.

"At 72 he was still working in the engineering and fabrication industry, something that had taken his interest some 56 years ago and remained a life-long passion.

"John enjoyed collecting things and was very proud of his French heritage. Whilst he did not have any immediate family he leaves behind two brothers, three sisters and a host of nephews and nieces."
