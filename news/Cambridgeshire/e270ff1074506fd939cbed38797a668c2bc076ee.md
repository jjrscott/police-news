Motorists are being warned to expect extra congestion in Cambridge this weekend due to the Midsummer Fair.

The fair on Midsummer Common opened today (June 20) and will run until Monday (June 25).

With thousands of people expected to attend the fair, those planning to use the city are advised that it will be busier than usual. It is expected to be particularly busy at the weekend.

Chief Inspector Paul Ormerod said: "Cambridge is a busy place at weekends, but it is expected to be exceptionally so in the coming days. With additional visitors to the city there will be an inevitable increase in congestion.

"Public safety is our number one priority, but we are also working with the organisers and partners in the local authority to minimise the impact of the fair on the city. If you're planning to visit Cambridge we'd recommend using the Park and Ride schemes or use parking facilities outside the city centre."
