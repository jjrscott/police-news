A man who was caught performing an indecent act outside a children's play park in Peterborough has been jailed.

Gary Smith, 46, was seen by members of the public touching himself outside Fletton Recreation Ground on 20 July.

Police were called and after being shown a video of the incident by a member of the public an officer identified Smith.

He was arrested at his home in London Road that evening. Smith has a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) which specifically prohibits him from entering any public parks.

On Wednesday (19 August) at Peterborough Crown Court he was jailed for 15 months after pleading guilty to outraging public decency and breaching a CBO.

Detective Sergeant Paul Stimpson said: "Smith had clear requirements to not enter any public parks which he blatantly ignored.

"I am pleased he has been given a custodial sentence and he will be closely watched once he has been released."
