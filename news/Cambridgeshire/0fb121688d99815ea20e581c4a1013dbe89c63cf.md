We are appealing for witnesses following disorder in Cambridge after Cambridge United's clash with Colchester United on Saturday (30 March).

Three people were arrested in connection with the incidents.

Inspector Paul Rogerson said: "This kind of behaviour shines a negative light on the majority of fans who want to support and watch their team.

"Football matches are family-friendly environments and any disorder will be fully investigated."

If you were in the area at the time and have any information please call us on 101 quoting incident 245 of 30 March.
