When you hand in a firearm, imitation or ammunition, we will destroy it.

Unless, like in this instance, it is considered to be of historical interest.

Three muskets were handed to us at Parkside Police Station following the ill health of their owner. Our crime property officer had contacts with a military museum in Dover (Princess of Wales Royal Regiment) and was able to facilitate the safe transfer of two of them to the museum and one to 42nd Highland Regiment re-enactment group.
