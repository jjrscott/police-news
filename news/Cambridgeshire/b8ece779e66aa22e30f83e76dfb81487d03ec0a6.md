A woman who killed a motorcyclist while performing a U-turn along a busy road has been handed a suspended sentence.

Maame Afrifa-Osew of Bolton Road, Enfield was sentenced to two year imprisonment, suspended for two years, at Cambridge Crown Court on Friday (September 8) after being found guilty of death by dangerous driving.

The court heard how the 45-year-old woman was driving a Citroen Picasso along the A10 at Melbourn on January 30 last year (2016) when she performed a U-turn across the road and into the path of a Kawasaki motorbike.

Sadly the rider of the motorcycle, 75-year-old Anthony Taylor, of Deer Park Way, Waltham Abbey, died at the scene.

Forensic collision investigation PC James Thorne from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit said: "Afrifa-Osew performed a manoeuver without looking in a fashion which showed complete disregard for other road users, in particular that of Mr Taylor who sadly died as a result.

"I would urge all motorists that when conducting complex manoeuvres to ensure that it is safe and appropriate to do so as the consequences can be severe."

Afrifa-Osew was also ordered to do 300 hours unpaid work, disqualified from driving for two years and must take an extended retest.
