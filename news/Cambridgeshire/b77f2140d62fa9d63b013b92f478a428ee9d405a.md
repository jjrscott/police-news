Two men have been arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of cannabis following a warrant in Peterborough this morning (Tuesday 23 June).

The warrant was carried out at about 8.30am in Stone Lane, Millfield, where we discovered about Â£2,000 worth of cannabis hidden inside a barbecue and a shoe box.

Two men, aged 24 and 39, were arrested at the premises and are currently in custody at Thorpe Wood Police Station.
