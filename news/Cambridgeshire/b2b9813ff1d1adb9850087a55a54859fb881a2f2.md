Detectives investigating burglaries in and around Cambridge have released images of Christmas wrapping paper found with a haul of stolen items.

Wrapping paper 1

It is believed a number of Christmas presents were stolen and then unwrapped by the offender, however the paper was not disposed of and was found in a bin bag inside a van.

Detective Sergeant Colin Norden said: "Unfortunately we have not been able to recover the gifts that were inside the paper, however I am hoping someone who is missing their gifts will recognise the paper and we will be able to establish where it was stolen from."

Anyone who recognises the paper is urged to contact police by calling 101 and quoting 35/51325/18.
