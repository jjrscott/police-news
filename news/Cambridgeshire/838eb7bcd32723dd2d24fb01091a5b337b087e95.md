A prolific cycle thief from Cambridge has been given a two-year Criminal Behaviour Order.

Mark Shinners, 44, of no fixed abode, was handed the Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) at Cambridge Magistrates' Court on Wednesday (18 November) as part of a crackdown on cycle thieves in the city.

The 44-year-old was caught on CCTV using bolt croppers to steal a bike parked in St Mary's Street on 7 October.

He made off from officers but crashed into a tree and fell off before attempting to make off again on foot. The bike was recovered and Shinners was arrested.

At court he pleaded guilty and was ordered to pay a Â£40 fine.

The CBO states he must:

 * Not to be in possession of a pedal cycle or parts of a pedal cycle without documentary proof of ownership or permission to use the pedal cycle.
 * Not to be in possession, in a public place, of any item used to steal pedal cycles or parts of a pedal cycle.

PC Leigh Browne from the Cambridge city neighbourhood policing team said: "Shinners is a prolific Cambridge bike thief whose behaviour has affected many members of the cycling community.

"Anyone who sees him breaching his CBO should report it to police who will deal with it robustly."
