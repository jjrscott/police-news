A man who has persistently committed thefts in Peterborough city centre has been issued with a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO).

Quentin Hyland, 38, of no fixed abode, was given the order following multiple incidents of interfering with vehicles in Woodston.

The order was issued at Cambridge Magistrates' Court on Tuesday (24 March) and lasts for one year.

It stipulates that Hyland must:

 * Attend all Community Rehabilitation Company probation appointments
 * Engage with Aspire (drug and alcohol services)
 * Not to touch or enter any unattended vehicle without express permission from the owner
 * Not to enter exclusion zone between 10pm and 7am on any day (see map below)

Sgt Justin Howard said: "Hyland is a prolific opportunistic thief. His street presence has been unpleasant and intimidating for people to experience and causes a significant impact upon the city.

"We hope the CBO will make the city a safer place to be."

Anyone who witnesses Hyland breaching these conditions should call police on 101.
