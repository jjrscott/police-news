We are appealing for information following an attempted robbery in Paston on Thursday (12 March).

The victim, a woman in her 20s, was walking along the cycle path in Whitwell at about 9.35pm when a man approached her from behind.

The man, who is described as in his late 20s, about 6'0" and of a slim build, wearing a navy jacket and dark trousers, tried to grab the woman's bag.

He fled after the woman shouted and struck him.

PC Igor Simonov, who is investigating, said: "This was undoubtedly a frightening experience for the woman.

"I am urging anyone with any information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, to get in touch."

Anyone with information should call police on 101 quoting 35/18691/20 or visit www.cambs.police.uk/report.

Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
