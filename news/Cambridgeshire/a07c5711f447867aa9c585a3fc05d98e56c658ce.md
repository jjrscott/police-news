A prisoner has had two years added to his sentence after he slashed the face of a fellow inmate.

Keiran Blair, 27, was spotted approaching another inmate by a prison guard at HMP Whitemoor, March, on 20 February at about 6pm.

Blair, who is serving a 14-year sentence for drug and firearms offences, produced an improvised weapon made from wood and razor blades and began slashing the victim's face.

Guards noticed the other inmates shouting as the victim tried to defend himself and ran over to intervene.

The men were separated and Blair attempted to hide the blood-covered weapon in his trousers. Officers found the weapon and transported Blair to a segregated unit while the victim was treated for serious facial injuries.

Blair admitted charges of assault occasioning GBH and was handed an additional two years to be served on top of his existing sentence.

DC Emily Clarke said: "This was a vicious, calculated attack on an unsuspecting victim.

"Blair caused a great deal of damage to the victim's face but thankfully the guards were on hand to prevent more serious injury."
