Do you recognise these women?

We would like to speak to them in connection with a theft from a shop in Cambridge last month.

At about 4.30pm on Tuesday, 21 September, clothes worth nearly Â£2,000 were stolen from a bridal shop in Homerton Street.

Officers are keen to identify the women in the CCTV and urge anyone who may know who they are to pass on information by reporting it online at www.cambs.police.uk/report and quote 35/31835/18, or calling 101.

Can you help us identify these women?
