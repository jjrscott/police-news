A man from Fenland has been arrested in connection with the supply of class A drugs and cannabis production.

The 47-year-old from Elm in Wisbech was arrested by the local neighbourhood team last night (Sunday 1 November) in Clarkson Avenue at about 7.30pm.

Officers had been alerted to a suspected drug deal and caught up with the car in question - when searching both the driver and the car, they found class A and B drugs.

The man was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs, and possession of cannabis. He was taken to the Police Investigation Centre (PIC) in Kings Lynn where he remains.

A subsequent search was carried out at the man's home address which uncovered a cannabis factory estimated to be worth more than Â£10,000.

Anyone with information is urged to report drug dealing and related crime to police online.
