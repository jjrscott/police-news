A woman who grew cannabis for medicinal purposes has been given a community order.

Tracey Unwin, 50, of Guntons Road, Newborough was handed the 12 month order as well as 120 hours unpaid work at Peterborough Crown Court on Thursday (20 June) after pleading guilty to production of a Class B drug.

In May last year officers discovered 86 cannabis plants, with a street value of more than Â£24,000, growing in sheds, a container and a sun room at Unwin's home.

In interview Unwin accepted the plants were hers and claimed she was growing them for medicinal purposes. She told officers she has arthritis, carpel tunnel syndrome and lung disease and the oil from the plants was helping with the pain.

Detective Sergeant Philip Booty said: "Unwin admitted straight away that the cannabis was for medicinal purposes but this is still a criminal offence.

"Anyone in the county found in possession, growing, distributing or selling cannabis will be put before the courts."
