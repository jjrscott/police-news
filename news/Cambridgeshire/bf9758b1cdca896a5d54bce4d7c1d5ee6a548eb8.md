We've released CCTV images of the men we would like to speak to in connection with two burglaries in Fenland.

On 26 January, between 1.30pm and 2pm, several pieces of farming equipment were stolen from a farm in Upwell Road, March.

The following day, on 27 January at about 10.40am, socket sets worth Â£130 each and a number of power tools were stolen from residential garages in Harecroft Road, Wisbech, as well as a white KTM 250 motor cross bike from one of the gardens.

Anyone with information about the incidents, or who recognises the men in the images is urged to get in touch. Please contact us via our web-chat, on 101 quoting crime reference number 35/4810/21 or by visiting www.cambs.police.uk/report. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
