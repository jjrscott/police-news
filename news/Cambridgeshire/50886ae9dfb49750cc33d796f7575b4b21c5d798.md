A thief who stole to pay off his drug debts has been jailed for 14 weeks.

Jamie Churchman of Leete Road, Cambridge was caught shoplifting 12 times between 12 December and 11 January.

The 33-year-old stole chocolate bars worth more than Â£150, meat, vodka, champagne and washing detergent during his spree which he claimed was necessary to pay off his drug debts.

The incidents took place at Co-Ops in Perne Road and Mill Road, Tesco in Yarrow Road and Cherry Hinton, BP garage in Teversham and Nisa in Capuchin Court.

At Peterborough Magistrates' Court on Monday (20 January) he pleaded guilty to 12 counts of shoplifting. He was sentenced to a week in prison for each theft and two weeks for breaching proceedings.

PC Sean Feline said: "Shoplifting has a detrimental effect on not only the businesses involved but the people working within them and the community which they serve.

"Often shoplifting goes hand-in-hand with other issues and I hope Churchman gets the help he needs in prison to prevent him from further re-offending."
