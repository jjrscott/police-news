A judge has jailed a Cambridge man after deeming him to pose a significant risk to women.

Chesney Christie, 30, of Montreal Square, in Cambridge, handed himself in to police on 29 July last year (2017) after stabbing his partner multiple times in the early hours.

The court heard Christie and his partner, a woman in her 30s, had been at his home and drinking alcohol when they started talking about Christie's criminal past. Christie told the victim he was in prison for a serious assault, to which she then asked him if he was on the Sex Offenders Register.

Christie admitted he was, but became agitated and left the room. He returned with a kitchen knife and lunged towards the victim, stabbing her five times and knocking her to the ground.

He then dropped the knife but continued to assault the victim, punching her several times to the face.

After being disturbed by another occupant of the house, Christie fled the scene, but later handed himself in at Parkside Police Station in Cambridge.

On 15 January at Cambridge Crown Court he pleaded guilty to section 20 inflicting grievous bodily harm (GBH) and yesterday (Monday, 26 February) was jailed for three years and seven months at The Old Bailey in London by Judge David Farrell.

At the time of the incident Christie was on licence after being released from prison just seven months before, after serving an indeterminate sentence for sexual assault and robbery of a woman in Cambridge in 2007.

Due to his previous conviction, Christie was recalled to prison and will continue to serve his indeterminate sentence.

Sentencing, Judge Farrell said Christie was a "real danger to women" and continued to pose a significant threat to them.

The officer in the case, Detective Constable Kevin Sutcliffe, said: "The victim enquired with Christie about his criminal history, which led to an unprovoked and frenzied attack leaving her with five stab wounds and injuries to her face.

"Christie will again be behind bars for a considerable amount of time, during which he will no longer be a threat to women."
