A burglar left documents with his name on at the scene of a crime after coming face-to-face with the elderly victim.

Homeless Eudizio De Assis, 29, broke into the 89-year-old woman's house in Park Parade, Cambridge on 25 February by smashing her kitchen window.

The victim was upstairs getting ready for bed at about 10.30pm when she heard the sound of smashing glass down below.

She came downstairs to find De Assis in the kitchen where she confronted him, asking what he was doing in her house before telling him she would call the police.

De Assis turned and fled through the garden.

Officers arrived to find De Assis had left a rucksack on the victim's roof, which contained documents with his name on. His fingerprints were found by forensic officers on the broken window and he was later spotted by local neighbourhood officers and arrested.

De Assis pleaded guilty to burglary and was sentenced to a year in prison yesterday at Cambridge Crown Court.

DC Victoria Norden said: "This victim was vulnerable and showed tremendous bravery in confronting De Assis.

"Hopefully this sentence will give De Assis time to reconsider his actions and their impact."
