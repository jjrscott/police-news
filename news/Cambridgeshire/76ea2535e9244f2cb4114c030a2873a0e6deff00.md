Three more arrests have been made this week thanks to the vigilance of an off duty officer out on a run.

PC Dan Scott was jogging around green spaces in Cambridge yesterday (15 May) when he spotted three men he suspected were dealing drugs.

He contacted colleagues from the Southern Impact Team, who travelled from Cambourne to make the arrests.

In the meantime, PC Scott jogged round the park for more than an hour while he observed the suspects and reported back to the team.

Two of the men were arrested on suspicion of supplying a controlled drug and the third was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in supplying class A drugs. The three suspects remain in custody at Parkside Police Station.

PC Scott said: "I hadn't planned to run quite as far as I ended up going but it was worth it to see these suspects successfully arrested."

The arrests come hot on the heels of those made as a result of suspicious activity spotted by Superintendent Jon Hutchinson who was out jogging in Cambridge on Tuesday.

Superintendent Hutchinson spotted a burglary suspect from Liverpool who was arrested and charged with burglary.
