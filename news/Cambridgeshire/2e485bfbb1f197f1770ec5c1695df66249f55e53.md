A three-month closure order has been served on a house in Wisbech following a high number of calls to the address regarding anti-social behaviour (ASB) and criminality.

An initial notice was issued to flat 30 of Brancaster Court in Staithe Road, by the Fenland Neighbourhood Policing Team on Tuesday afternoon (15 September), lasting 48 hours.

A successful application was made to Cambridge Magistrates' Court yesterday (17 September) for the property to be closed for the next three months.

Neighbourhood Officer Katie Stevens said: "The anti-social behaviour at this address has caused great distress to neighbours and I am pleased we have been able to use our powers to improve the lives and wellbeing of all those who were affected."

The order states the premises is subject to a closure order as 'a person has engaged, or is likely to engage in disorderly, offensive or criminal behaviour on the premises, that the premise has resulted in serious nuisance to members of the public, is likely to result in disorder if it is not closed and closure is necessary in order to prevent the behaviour, nuisance or disorder from continuing, recurring or occurring'.

Until 17 December the order prohibits any person from entering the premises, other than the landlords, tradespeople approved by the landlord and emergency services, under Section 80 of the Anti-Social Behaviour Crime and Policing Act 2014.

Failure to comply with the order is a criminal offence which could result in imprisonment for up to three months, a fine, or both.
