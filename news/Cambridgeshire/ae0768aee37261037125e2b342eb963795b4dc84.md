Three men have been jailed for a combined total of almost 15 years for drug offences in Cambridge.

Seymour Kenlock, 40, of James Joyce Walk, Lambeth, Dean Mason, 38, of Rowlinson Way, Cambridge and Adrian Hayles, 37, of no fixed abode were all found guilty of being concerned in the supply of heroin and cocaine at Cambridge Crown Court on 2 May.

Acting on intelligence, officers arrested the men in Rowlinson Way on 9 May, 2016 and seized cash, mobile phones, drugs and drug paraphernalia from the house.

Officers also found a key to another property in Neath Farm Court in Cherry Hinton where a safe containing £7,000 in cash and £12,000 of cocaine and heroin were discovered.

Kenlock was jailed for six-and-a-half years, Mason four-and-a-half years and Hayles was given three-and-a-half years.

Sergeant Paul Street said: "The lengthy prison sentences given by the judge demonstrate the serious nature of the offences. We recognise and prioritise this type of offending due to the harm it causes our society. I hope these sentences will deter drug dealers from coming to Cambridge."
