A man who verbally abused a woman on her own driveway has been handed a restraining order.

Jonathan Reed, 34, of Church Road, Teversham, Cambridge pleaded guilty to using threatening behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress.

On 1 August last year, Reed waited for his victim to finish work then blocked her onto her driveway in Cambridge. He subjected her to verbal abuse before kicking, rocking and punching her vehicle.

He eventually stopped when a member of the public intervened and police were called.

On Thursday (12 April) at Huntingdon Magistrates Court Reed was sentenced to a 12-month community order and made subject of a restraining order for a year.

PC Gary Nightingale said: "I hope this sentence will allow the victim to move on with her life without the fear of continuing offences from Reed.

"This result is a fine example of what happens when the support of domestic abuse victims is combined with the police's commitment to relentlessly tackling this issue."
