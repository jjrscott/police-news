A registered sex offender has been sentenced after he breached the terms of his Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO).

Robin Barker, 67, was handed the order in 2012 after he was found with indecent images of children.

Officers visited Barker in November last year, as part of a routine check on registered sex offenders in the county.

Officers searched Barker's phone, but found his browsing history had been deleted, violating one of the terms of his SHPO.

When interviewed by officers, Barker, of Orton Malborne, Peterborough admitted looking at several online dating sites on his phone before deleting the device's search history.

On Friday (13 November) at Peterborough Crown Court he was jailed for 20 weeks, suspended for two years, having pleaded guilty to breaching his SHPO at a previous hearing.

Detective Sergeant Paul Stimpson, from the Public Protection Unit, said: "The terms of Barker's SHPO are clear, and were put in-place to prevent any further offences taking place.

"Our officers diligently check on sex offenders across the county, to confirm they are adhering to the terms set by the courts."
