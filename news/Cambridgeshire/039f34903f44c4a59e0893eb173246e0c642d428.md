Two men have been charged in connection with the stabbing of a man in Fletton High Street on Valentine's Day (Sunday).

A man in his 20s suffered stab wounds and was taken to hospital but his injuries were not believed to be serious and he was discharged later the same day.

Yesterday morning (Wednesday), two men aged 20 and 25 were arrested in Fengate.

They have both been charged with violent disorder and will appear at Cambridge Magistrates' Court today (Thursday).

The 25-year-old has also been charged with being in possession of cannabis.
