A closure order has been put in place in a bid to prevent anti-social behaviour.

The order was issued to 127 Victoria Road, Arbury, Cambridge today (9 February) after a successful application from police to Cambridge Magistrates' Court.

The action came as a result of frequent reports of anti-social behaviour, drug use and criminal activity.

A closure order was granted and the property will be closed for three months.

PC Morgan French from the City North Neighbourhood Team said: "We've received persistent reports and information relating to people visiting the address including those of drug dealing, drug use, noise and anti-social behaviour.

"We hope that preventing visitors will significantly reduce the impact on the local residents."

The closure order states the house be closed in accordance with the Anti-Social Behaviour and Policing Act 2014 and only permits access to the tenant and emergency services until 9 May. If anyone is found on the premises unlawfully they render themselves liable to arrest.
