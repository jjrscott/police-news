Police are searching for a man wanted in connection with an attempted armed robbery at a bank near Cambridge.

Officers were called just after 4pm yesterday (11 June) to reports of a robbery at the Cambridge Building Society in High Street, Sawston.

Bank staff told officers that a man entered the building armed with a gun and demanded money from cashiers inside.

Staff retreated round the back of the counters and the man then left empty handed, fleeing on foot.

Searches of the area for the man were carried out by armed officers and the NPAS police helicopter, but were unsuccessful.

At the time of the attempted robbery the man was wearing a brown/green padded jacket, dark trousers and a white or beige floppy woven sun hat.

The man is described as approximately 5" 4' tall and aged between 40 and 55 with a greying goatee.

DS James Rabbett said: "The area was likely to have been busy at the time and we would urge anyone who saw anything, no matter how small, to contact us.

"We would urge members of the public to be vigilant and if they think they see the man described, not to approach him but to call 999."

Anyone with any information should call us on 101, quoting crime reference number 35/40577/19.

Call 999 with any immediate sightings.
