Detectives are releasing photographs of thousands of items of property recovered as part of an investigation into a prolific crime gang.

They hope to reunite the items, which are believed to have come from crimes in Cambridgeshire and surrounding counties between 9 December 2016 and 9 January 2018, with their rightful owners.

Last month, the gang members were sentenced to a total of 71 years in jail. They had committed more than 200 burglaries, including nearly 100 in Cambridgeshire, costing victims more than Â£2 million pounds.

Gang members would mask their faces using balaclavas and smash or force open doors or windows in broad daylight. They would steal specific items, mainly high-powered BMWs and Audis, firearms, cash and jewellery, all of which they could dispose of through contacts.

Norfolk suffered a similar number of burglaries to Cambridgeshire while other offences took place in Suffolk, Essex and Bedfordshire.
