We are appealing for witnesses following a burglary series in South Cambridgeshire yesterday (6 March).

Between 7.30am and 9pm six properties were targeted by offenders and jewellery and cash were stolen.

The burglaries were at:

 * Ellison Lane, Hardwick between 12.30pm and 4.10pm when offenders smashed a window and stole jewellery.
 * Forment Way, Milton between 3.40pm and 4.20pm when a window was smashed and the rooms searched.
 * Old Forge Way, Sawston between 7.30am and 9pm two properties in the street were targeted. In one incident patio doors were forced open and cash was stolen. In the second jewellery was stolen and the property was entered through an upstairs window.
 * Lucerne Close, Fulbourn between 9.30am and 7.54pm someone has gone into the property through an upstairs window and searched the rooms.
 * Elms Avenue, Great Shelford, at around 7.10pm when two men, dressed in dark clothing and wearing balaclavas, tried to break into the property before getting into a silver vehicle, possibly a people carrier, and heading towards Cambridge.

We are keen to hear from anyone who was in the areas targeted yesterday who noticed anything suspicious or saw the men in the silver vehicle.

Any information, no matter how small, could prove vital to the investigation.

At this stage we are looking at these offences as a series and enquiries continue to trace those responsible.

Anyone with information regarding these offences should call police on 101 quoting CF0123240318 or visit our online reporting. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via their website.
