Police have charged two people with modern slavery, fraud and money laundering offences.

Two arrests were made by officers yesterday (14 July) in Cambourne and Cambridge and the man and woman have now been charged.

Ernest Drevenak, 41, of Howard Avenue, Bedford, has been charged with five counts of holding a person in slavery or servitude, five counts of arranging or facilitating travel of another person with a view to exploitation, one count of money laundering and one count of fraud by false representation.

Veronika Bubencikova, 42, of Handley Drive, Upper Cambourne, also faces the same 12 charges.

The offences are alleged to have taken place over five years between 2014 and 2019, and involved five different alleged victims.

Both Drevenak and Bubencikova have been released on conditional bail until their first court appearance, scheduled to take place at Cambridge Magistrates' Court on Friday, 25 September.
