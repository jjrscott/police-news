A man who had to be cut out of a stolen car he crashed into parked vehicles and two walls in Peterborough has been jailed.

Liam Goldswain, 22, was driving the Seat Leon along Fletton Avenue in the early hours of 15 November when it left the road, causing damage to the vehicles and the walls of two driveways.

Police officers, paramedics and fire crews attended the scene and Goldswain and a passenger in the Seat, which had been reported stolen the previous day, were taken to hospital with minor injuries.

Officers also discovered a small amount of cannabis in the vehicle.

Goldswain, of Fieldfare Drive, Stanground, Peterborough, admitted driving without insurance, driving without reasonable consideration for others, possession of class B drugs, aggravated vehicle taking and damaging property worth more than Â£5,000.

Today (25 January) at Peterborough Crown Court he was sentenced to 20 weeks in prison.

Detective Constable Mark Yendley said: "Goldswain's behaviour was completely reckless. It is only luck there was no one on the pavement or the driveways at the time as they could have been seriously injured or worse.

"He and his passenger were also fortunate to walk away without serious injuries."
