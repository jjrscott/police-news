A boy has been arrested after Police Dog Krow tracked down the sword he had discarded.

The 16 year old was seen on CCTV at around 3am this morning (10 September) in possession of a weapon near Railworld Wildlife Haven in Oundle Road, Peterborough.

An officer stopped him in Oundle Road but when he was searched nothing was found.

Fortunately PD Krow was on hand to search the area and quickly located the sword nearby which matched what had been seen on CCTV.

The boy remains in custody at Thorpe Wood Police Station.
