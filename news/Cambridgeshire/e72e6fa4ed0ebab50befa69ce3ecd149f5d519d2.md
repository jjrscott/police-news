A Cambridge man has been jailed after attacking his neighbour with a bottle.

Geoffrey Peacock, 58, was at his home in Edinburgh Road, Cambridge, on the evening of 28 July.

At just before 7.15pm, Peacock called police to say there had been a dispute with his neighbour and he was going to harm him.

About five minutes later, Peacock left his address and threw two beer bottles through the living room window of the neighbour's flat, smashing the glass whilst the victim was inside.

When the neighbour, a man in his 20s, approached Peacock, he used a broken bottle to slash the victim's arm causing a deep wound.

Following his arrest, it came to light Peacock had destroyed the victim's fence and Sky TV cable the week before following reports of anti-social behaviour made against him.

Peacock pleaded guilty to assault causing actual bodily harm, three counts of criminal damage and breach of conditional discharge. He was sentenced to 14 months in prison at Cambridge Crown Court yesterday (23 September).

**Detective Constable Dan Harper said** : "Peacock's dangerous behaviour was completely unacceptable and was as a result of an ongoing dispute between the neighbours.

"No one should feel scared or at risk in their own home and this type of violence will not be tolerated.

"I hope this sentencing is a relief for the victim and Peacock's time behind bars gives him a chance to reflect on his actions."
