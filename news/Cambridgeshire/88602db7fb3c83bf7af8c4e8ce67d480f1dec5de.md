Two men who bundled hundreds of fragrances into blankets and dragged them out of a Cambridge stored have been sent to prison.

John Evans and Terence Ralph used a claw hammer to break into Boots in Petty Cury in the early hours of 10 April.

Realising the alarm was broken, once inside they forced open the display cabinets and filled bags with perfume and aftershave worth more than £22,000. They put the bags onto blankets and dragged them out of the store along with £190 they had taken from two of the tills.

Evans, 54, of Oatlands Avenue, Bar Hill pleaded guilty to burglary and breaching a suspended sentence order and at Cambridge Crown Court on Friday (12 June) he was sentenced to 22 months in prison.

Ralph, 60, of Howard de Walden Way, Newmarket pleaded guilty to burglary and was sentenced to 20 months at Cambridge Crown Court yesterday (17 June).

Detective Constable Zoe Patten said: "The pair broke into the Boots store during the height of lockdown which meant the essential store had to remain closed for a period of time while repairs were carried out.

"This was a pre-meditated offence as they arrived with equipment to open the door and blankets to take the stolen goods away."
