A man who hit his partner with a glass and grabbed her by the throat has avoided jail.

Hugh Cholmondeley, 48, had an argument with the victim at their home in Ditton Fields, Cambridge, after she accused him of being unfaithful.

Cholmondeley reacted angrily, picked up a glass and hit the victim in the face, causing a significant cut to her nose. He then grabbed her by the throat.

The victim, a woman in her 40s, went to Addenbrooke's Hospital for treatment, where she reported the incident to a police officer.

Cholmondeley was arrested the following day and later charged with assault causing actual bodily harm.

Yesterday (14 June) at Cambridge Crown Court Cholmondeley was sentenced to a year and three months in prison, suspended for two years, having pleaded guilty at a previous hearing.

He was also ordered to do 180 hours of unpaid work, to pay £500 compensation, a £140 victim surcharge and £1200 prosecution costs.
