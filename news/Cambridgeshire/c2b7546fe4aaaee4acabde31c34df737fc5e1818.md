A drug dealer who drove up another car and crashed through a garden fence in an attempt to get away from police has been jailed.

Rahel Miah, 25, was spotted by police picking up a drug user in his Seat Ibiza in Gray Road, Cherry Hinton, Cambridge, on 16 March.

They began following him in their patrol car but moments later Miah crashed into a parked Ford Fiesta, which was rammed into another parked car. Miah struggled to pull away and revved the engine. When he managed to gain traction against the side of the Ford Fiesta he crashed through a picket fence and came to stop in a garden.

Officers arrested Miah after chasing after him into Chalmers Road. During the chase £195 in notes fell out of his pockets.

Inside his car were three mobile phones and £55 in cash. A sealed bag containing 21 wraps of cocaine and 20 wraps of heroin, with a potential street value of £410, was found on the ground directly outside the open driver's side door.

The drug user who was seen in the passenger seat of Miah's car was searched but nothing was found on her.

Yesterday (9 September) at Peterborough Crown Court Miah, after pleading guilty to two counts of possession with intent to supply class A drugs and dangerous driving, was sentenced to 37 months imprisonment. He was also disqualified from driving for the total of his imprisonment, plus a further two years upon his release.

PC Matt Smith said: "Miah acted selfishly and recklessly in his attempt to escape. Luckily, despite the dangerous way in which he drove, no one was hurt but the outcome could have been much worse.

"The sale of class A drugs is the cause of many other crimes affecting society such as burglary, theft and anti-social behaviour and we will continue to crack down on those involved."
