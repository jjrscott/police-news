Police have released CCTV videos of two men they would like to speak to in connection with an attempted burglary in Eye.

A garage, in St Benets Gardens, was broken into at about 1am on 13 February but the intruders were disturbed by the resident and made off.

Officers are keen to identify who is responsible and urge anyone who may recognise the men to pass on information by calling 101 and quoting 35/11069/20, alternatively you can report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report.
