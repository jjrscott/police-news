Three people have been arrested following a large-scale disorder in Queensgate shopping centre yesterday afternoon (Tuesday 30 July).

We were called at just before 4.30pm with reports of about 20 people fighting on the ground floor of the centre between John Lewis and Primark.

Two boys, aged 17, and a 30-year-old woman were arrested on suspicion of affray. They have since been released under investigation while officers continue with their inquiries.

Anyone with information about the incident should call us on 101 or report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report quoting 35/54281/19.
