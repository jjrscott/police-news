Police have today (16 October) executed five drugs warrants at addresses in Gonville Place, Cambridge.

Entering under the Misuse of Drugs Act, officers seized items believed to be linked to the supply of illegal drugs.

An 18-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class B drugs and possessing articles for use in fraud and remains in custody.

A 21-year-old woman is also assisting officers with their enquiries.

PC Steve Girdlestone, of the Cambridge City North Neighbourhood Team, said: "Today's warrant was a result of public intelligence and is yet another example of how important their information is.

"I would encourage anybody who suspects illegal drug activity in their area to get in touch with us."
