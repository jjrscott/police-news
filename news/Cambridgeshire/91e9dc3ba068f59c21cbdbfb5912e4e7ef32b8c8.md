A man from Essex who admitted head-butting a supermarket worker while armed with a metal pole has been jailed for two years.

Scott Archer, 32, of no fixed address, was arrested on 14 May following an assault on a member of staff at Sainsbury's in the Bretton Centre.

At about 9.30pm that night, Archer, who was armed with a metal pole, had a verbal argument with the 62-year-old victim which escalated to Archer head-butting him.

The following day (15 May), he was charged with possessing an offensive weapon in a public place and assault.

He was also charged with breaching a restraining order after he called an ex-partner more than 100 times on 5 May.

He admitted the offences at Huntingdon Magistrates' Court and today (Tuesday 9 June) appeared at Peterborough Crown Court where he was sentenced to two years in prison.

He has also been made subject of a further restraining order prohibiting from contacting his ex-partner indefinitely.
