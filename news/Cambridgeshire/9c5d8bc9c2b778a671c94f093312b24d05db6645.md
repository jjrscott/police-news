A TEENAGER who used a ladder to break into a Huntingdon home and steal a laptop has been sentenced.

Cobi Thomas, 18, pleaded guilty to dwelling burglary and theft and was sentenced to six months in a Young Offenders Institute on Wednesday (6 May) at Peterborough Magistrates' Court.

He used a ladder found in the garden of a home in Bernard Close to break in through a window and steal a laptop worth £250 and cash while the victim was out at work in June 2018.

Thomas was arrested after his finger prints were found at the scene. He was also ordered to pay £280 compensation.

Detective Constable Neil Gibbs said: "We're committed to tackling burglary across the county and putting those responsible before the courts. Being burgled can have a significant and long-lasting impact on victims."
