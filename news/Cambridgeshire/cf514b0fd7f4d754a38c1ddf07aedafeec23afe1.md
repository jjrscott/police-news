Two women have been arrested following the execution of warrants into the sale of illegally imported products in Peterborough this morning (Monday 22 June).

The women, aged 21 and 30, were arrested after we discovered tobacco and cigarettes worth up to about Â£20,000 which are suspected to have been imported into the UK illegally.

We carried out six warrants across Peterborough this morning, resulting in about 3,000 packs of tobacco and cigarettes being seized from a flat and a shop in Fitzwilliam Street.

Warrants were also carried out in Broadway, Lawson Avenue and London Road.

The women, who were arrested on suspicion of selling counterfeit goods, both remain in custody at Thorpe Wood Police Station.
