Police are appealing for information after the Church of St.Mary, Whaddon had thousands of pounds worth of lead stolen from its roof.

Officers believe the first theft occurred between 16 and 22 June and a second between 22 and 23 June, clearing the roof completely.

Substantial damage has also been caused to the stonework and the cost to repair this and replace the roof could be up to Â£100,000.

PC Sam Thompson from the rural crime action team investigating the incident, said: "This is a substantial theft, which has left the church without a roof and facing a hefty repair bill.

"We are keen to speak to anyone who may have any information or who may have seen anything suspicious in the area over the weekend."

Anyone with any information should contact police by calling 101 and quoting reference **_35/43890/19._** _ _ Alternatively you can report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report
