Officers are appealing for information following a suspected arson attack in Sawtry last night (9 October).

At around 10.20pm a yellow Volkswagen Golf was set alight outside a house on Beaumaris Road.

Sergeant Adam Bagulay said: "This incident could quite easily have been much more serious, as the car was parked by the main gas line to the property.

"I would urge anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident or who may know who is responsible to come forward. We will be increasing patrols in the area to reassure the public that we are taking this incident very seriously."

Anyone with information is asked to report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report or call 101 quoting 35/36331/18. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or report at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
