Two teenage boys have been charged in connection with the stabbing of a man in Dogsthorpe earlier this month.

The 16 and 17-year-olds, who cannot be named for legal reasons, have been charged with causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent following the incident in Elmfield Close on 6 May.

The 17-year-old has also been charged with possession with intent to supply cannabis.

The victim, a man in his 20s, suffered serious injuries but is now recovering.

Both boys appeared at Cambridge Magistrates' Court today (Tuesday 19 May) and have been released on bail to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on 27 May.
