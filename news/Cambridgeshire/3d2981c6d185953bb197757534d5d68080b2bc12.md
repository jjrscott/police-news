A man who used an improvised recording device to film up the skirts of strangers in Queensgate shopping Centre, Peterborough has been jailed for 20 months.

In May (2018) Nigel Matt, 56, was caught by security guards filming under the skirt of a female victim.

His home was searched and officers found 34 handheld recordings of women, dating back to July 2017.

Peterborough Crown Court heard that whilst on his lunch break from work, Matt would go to the shopping centre and select women that he found attractive. He would then then follow them up an escalator to illegally film them.

At court, Peterborough resident Matt pleaded guilty to outraging public decency, admitting that he saved the footage to watch again later.

Matt also faced further charges of voyeurism and taking and possessing indecent images of children for which he was also sentenced.

DC Victoria Speirs said: "Matt is a prolific offender with a string of offences spanning almost a year.

"I hope that this sentence acts as a deterrent to others who may consider similar actions."
