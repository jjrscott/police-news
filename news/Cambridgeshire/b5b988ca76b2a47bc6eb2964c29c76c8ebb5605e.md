Officers investigating a burglary at a phone shop in Market Place, Wisbech, have released CCTV images of two men they would like to speak to in connection with the incident.

In the early hours of Saturday, 29 September, a Bluetooth speaker and a wireless charger were stolen from the shop after a window was smashed to gain entry.

Officers are keen to identify the men in the CCTV images and urge anyone who may know who they are to pass on information by reporting online at www.cambs.police.uk/report and quote 35/33623/18, or you can call 101.

Do you recognise these men?
