A man who was caught with class A drugs stashed inside a Kinder Egg has been jailed.

Craig Stark, 35, was spotted engaging in a drug deal by officers on patrol in Huntingdon on 3 August, 2018.

As they approached, Stark and two other men fled but they managed to detain Stark after a struggle.

On him they found cocaine and heroin hidden in a Kinder Egg, and more drugs in his room at a B&B hostel, worth more than Â£600 altogether.

He pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply class A drugs and was jailed for 26 months at Peterborough Crown Court today (25 February).

Sergeant Michael Basford said: "Drugs devastate lives and cause misery for our communities.

Often drug dealing and violence go hand-in-hand, making it vital that we catch the perpetrators and bring them to justice."
