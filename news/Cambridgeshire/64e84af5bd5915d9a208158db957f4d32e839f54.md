We are appealing for information following two incidents where a man assaulted young women in Cambridge last week.

Both incidents happened in Mill Road between 3am and 4am on Wednesday (11 April).

In the first, three women in their early 20s were walking together when they witnessed a man performing a sexual act.

The women ran away but one of them was then slapped in the face by the man.

In the second, two women, again both in their early 20s, were approached by the man who hit one of them on her hip and inappropriately touched the other.

They shouted before the man ran off in the direction of Sainsbury's.

In both incidents the man is described as between 21 and 40, 5' 3" to 5' 6", with short, possibly curly, black hair, wearing light coloured shoes and a light red/pink top with dark jeans.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police by reporting online at www.cambs.police.uk/report and quote CF0192780418 or call 101.
