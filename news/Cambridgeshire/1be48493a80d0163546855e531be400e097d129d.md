Police have released CCTV images of two men they want to speak to in connection with thefts in Cambridge.

Two men entered Mobile Solutions, in the Grafton Centre, on 25 September before stealing three phones worth about Â£2000 altogether.

PC David Tee said: "We would urge members of the public to look at these images and contact police if they recognise either man or have any information."

Anyone with any information should call police on 101, quoting crime reference number 35/68951/19.
