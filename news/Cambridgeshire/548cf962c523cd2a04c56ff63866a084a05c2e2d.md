A dispersal order is in place in an area of East Cambridgeshire this weekend in a bid to reduce crime and disorder.

The measure has been taken by the local neighbourhood policing team in response to information about car meet ups and anti-social driving.

The order is in effect from 7pm today (14 August) until 6am on Sunday (16 August) and covers Elean Business Park in Sutton.

Special Sergeant Tom Howard from the East Cambs neighbourhood policing team said: "We've received increased reports of excessive noise, car meets and anti-social driving in the area.

"Not only does this activity cause distress to residents and disruption to local businesses but it is incredibly dangerous.

"The dispersal order gives us the power to make those causing the anti-social behaviour to leave the area with immediate effect and not to return within a specified period."

The order has been granted under section 34 of the Anti-Social Behaviour, crime and Policing Act 2014, and allows for Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs) and police officers to direct a person to leave the area specified within the order if they have reasonable grounds to suspect that their behaviour has caused, or is likely to cause, harassment, alarm or distress to members of the public. Failure to comply with the order can result in arrest.
