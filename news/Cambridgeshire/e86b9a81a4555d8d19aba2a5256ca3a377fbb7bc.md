Abdul Salam Ali, 23, and Ben Driver, 27, were arrested following a police investigation that began in March.

Ali was found to be supplying class A and B drugs to Driver to sell.

Cambridge Crown Court heard officers executed a warrant at Driver's home, in Akeman Street, Cambridge, in March and found cocaine, herbal cannabis, Â£700 in cash and a mobile phone.

Driver claimed the drugs were for his own use but was arrested and eventually pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply class A and B drugs.

Forensic officers were able to link the drugs to Ali, of Darwin Drive, Cambridge, through mobile phone messages and a finger print. He originally gave no comment in interviews but later pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply class A and B drugs.

Yesterday (September 20), Ali was jailed for three years and eight months and Driver for two years and three months.

Detective Constable Paul Evans said: "This result demonstrates that through solid investigative work, individuals will be brought to justice and punished.

"We will continue to target drug dealers who try to operate in Cambridge and this sentence should serve as a warning to others: they will be caught and put before the courts."
