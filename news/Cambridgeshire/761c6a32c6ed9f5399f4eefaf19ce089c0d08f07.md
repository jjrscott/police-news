A man who persistently begs and causes anti-social behaviour in the city has been given a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO).

Liam Berna, 27, from Cambridge has been given the two-year order which prohibits him from begging from passers-by and entering any building, car park or area of the Grand Arcade shopping centre.

Berna appeared at Cambridge Crown Court on Monday (2 December) when he pleaded guilty to possession of an offensive weapon after an incident in Corn Exchange Street on 11 July when he was found with a metal pole.

He was sentenced to five months imprisonment but released as he had already served the time on remand.

The CBO was granted in August by Cambridge Magistrates' Court but wasn't reported on at the time as there were ongoing criminal proceedings for other matters.

PC Jamie Tumber said: "Berna is well known to police and other services in the city for anti-social behaviour, crime and persistent begging. The CBO is necessary to prevent his behaviour further impacting businesses and visitors."

Anyone who witnesses Berna breaching these conditions should call police on 101.
