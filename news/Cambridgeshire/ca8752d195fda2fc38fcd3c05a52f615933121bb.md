We are appealing for information following a serious collision between a car and a cyclist on the B1101 at Coldham.

At about 5.20pm on Friday (29 January), officers attended the incident involving a black Audi A6 and a 15-year-old boy on a bike.

The boy, who is from Wisbech, was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge where he remains in a life threatening condition.

The driver, a man aged in his 60s from Downham Market in Norfolk, was not injured and remained at the scene.

We are appealing for anyone who witnessed the collision or who has dashcam footage to call 101 quoting incident 354 of 29 January, or report online.
