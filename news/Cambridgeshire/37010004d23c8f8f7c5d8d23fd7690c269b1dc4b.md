A 54-year-old man has been charged with drink driving and failing to stop at the scene of a collision in Peterborough.

Peycho Koshincharov was arrested on Friday night (5 June) after reports he had collided with a parked car in Little Close, Eye.

Officers located him at his home, also in Little Close, Eye, where he blew 90 on a breath test - more than twice the legal drink drive limit.

He has since been charged with drink driving and failing to stop at the scene of a collision and has been bailed to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on 9 July.
