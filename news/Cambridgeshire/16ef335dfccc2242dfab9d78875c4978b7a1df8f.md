A man has been jailed for a year and eight months after being found guilty of burgling a house in Peterborough.

Michael Hutchinson, 47, entered a property in Fengate, Peterborough, at about 5pm on 22 August, 2018.

The front door of the property had been left open due to hot weather, allowing Hutchinson to sneak in without the occupants realising.

When the victim went into her bedroom she found Hutchinson going through her belongings. He ran out of the property dropping a jewellery box as he went. Fingerprint analysis on the box later linked him to the crime.

Hutchinson denied a charge of burglary, but was found guilty and sentenced at Peterborough Crown Court today (14 July).

DC Tom Hunt said: "Hutchinson saw the open door and took advantage of it, even to this day he has taken no responsibility despite the overwhelming evidence and I am pleased the court were able to see this."
