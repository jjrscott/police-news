A man has been sentenced to deportation after he was caught red-handed growing more than Â£100,000 worth of cannabis.

Officers conducted a drugs warrant on a property in Eagle Way, Peterborough, on 25 April.

Lazam Peposhi, 19, was found alone at the address, which contained 197 cannabis plants growing in six rooms.

He tried to escape through the back door but was caught by officers.

He pleaded guilty to producing a class B drug at Cambridge Crown Court today (16 May) and was sentenced to 12 months in a young offenders institute and then will face deportation.

DC Ashley Byrne said: "We will continue to put those involved in the production and supply of drugs in the county before the courts and I hope today's result will serve as a deterrent to others."
