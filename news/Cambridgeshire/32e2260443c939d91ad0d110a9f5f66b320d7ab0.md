A man has been charged with five thefts from shops after more than Â£500 worth of stock was taken.

Mark Smith, 37, was arrested this morning (16 July) at his home address in Scotendon, Orton Goldhay.

This was in connection with five incidents of theft at Lloyds Pharmacy and the Co-op in the Orton Centre between 20 April and 14 July.

Smith has since been charged with five counts of theft from a shop and has been released on bail, with restrictions not to enter either shop, to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on 27 August.
