We are appealing for information to locate a man who has gone missing from Cambridge.

The man, 60-year-old Colin Campbell-Leitch, was last seen at about 7.30pm last night (15 April) in Brooklands Avenue.

Colin is described as white, approximately 5'6" and of large build. He has a shaved head and greying hair and beard. Colin was last seen wearing blue jeans with large turn-ups, a grey/green jumper, light green Parka jacket with a fur trim. He has a Scottish accent.

We are growing increasingly concerned for Colin's welfare and urge anyone who has seen him to contact police in the first instance.

Anyone who thinks they may have seen Colin or knows where he is should contact police immediately on 101 quoting: incident 152 of 16 April.

Missing: Colin Campbell-Leitch
