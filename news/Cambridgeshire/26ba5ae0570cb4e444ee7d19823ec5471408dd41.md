A Peterborough man has been charged with seven counts of theft from a shop following a swift arrest by the Impact Team this afternoon (Monday 8 April).

John Thompson, 35, of no fixed address, was brought into custody at 12.20pm after being arrested at the Brotherhood Retail Park in Lincoln Road.

Less than an hour-and-a-half later he was charged with six thefts relating to T K Maxx and one charge of engine oil theft from Woodgrange Service Centre in Werrington.

He has been remanded to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court this afternoon.

The Impact Team, who featured in Channel 4's recent series of Famous and Fighting Crime, cover the north of Cambridgeshire targeting the most elusive and prolific offenders.
