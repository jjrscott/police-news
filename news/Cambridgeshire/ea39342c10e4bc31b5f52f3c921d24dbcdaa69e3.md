We have today (15 January) seized suspected drugs at a home in Bassingbourn.

We raided the property in The Causeway under Section 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.

Inside the home we found suspected drugs, drug paraphernalia and a number of mobile phones.

A 20-year-old man and a 17-year-old girl were arrested on suspicion of drug offences and taken to Thorpe Wood Police Station, where they remain.

Sergeant Rob Taylor, of the South Cambs Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "Drugs can have a devastating impact on communities, often going hand in hand with other types of criminality.

"I would encourage anybody who suspects illegal drug activity in their area to get in touch with us."
