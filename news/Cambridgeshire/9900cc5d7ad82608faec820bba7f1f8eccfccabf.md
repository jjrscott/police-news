Chief Constable Nick Dean has vowed to keep a policing presence in the heart of Cambridge city if proposed plans to move Parkside Police Station go ahead.

Over the past year a team of experts has been working alongside Police and Crime Commissioner Jason Ablewhite to identify suitable sites to construct a new police station for the south of the county.

Chief Constable Nick Dean said: "Parkside Police Station was built in 1967 and as with any organisation whose desire is to deliver a modern day service, it is only right that we look at the infrastructure that assists us in delivering policing, now and into the future. Parkside Police Station is not fit for purpose and has been subject to an ongoing debate for many years.

"A great deal of analysis has taken place to understand the operational need of policing in the years to come; policing is complex, the crimes and incidents we investigative have changed beyond recognition, not least in the digital environment or within such crimes as child sexual exploitation, child abuse, domestic abuse and online crimes, to mention but a few.

"Having said that, the very essence of policing is built on a neighbourhood structure, of accessible, visible teams working closely with the public. That is why I have given my commitment that a policing presence will be within the heart of the city, even if the main police station is moved. This has always been within the plans right from day one and has been a consistent and strong message conveyed by both myself as the Chief Constable and the Police and Crime Commissioner.

"Policing is not an exact science and so the precise details of what that presence will look like cannot be forecast two or three years from now. Of course I have an idea around the presence of a public enquiry desk along with neighbourhood teams working closely with the public and key partners. I understand the concerns any closure of a police station brings, however I have been clear that policing will remain in the city and I would be keen to understand people's views to fully shape what that future proposal could look like.

"A key factor in a new facility is to address the cell capacity within the city of Cambridge. We simply do not have enough cells to cope with the current demand, let alone the future demands which we will have to deal with. The growth across the county is unprecedented and the new facility will have a substantial number of cells designed into its plans - this is in addition to modern day investigation and support accommodation for officers and staff. Although the number of detainees we arrest has declined slightly, the complexity of the crimes and the length of time people are held in custody has increased. We also face sometimes challenging medical conditions faced by often vulnerable people who find themselves in custody - the health and safety of those that we arrest and my own staff is vitally important.

"I cannot stress enough that policing is not being removed from Cambridge, in fact these exciting proposals will only enhance policing across the county. I am privileged to have been appointed the Chief Constable last September and I can assure the whole county I do not intend to compromise the policing of this county."
