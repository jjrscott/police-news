A man has been charged with six offences including threatening to a kill a Tesco member of staff in Peterborough and kicking two police officers.

The 26-year-old was arrested at Serpentine Green shopping centre in Hampton last night (Monday 7 September) following an incident in the Tesco store where one member of staff was bitten and another punched.

He has since been charged with making threats to kill, assault causing actual bodily harm (ABH) and common assault against members of staff at Tesco, two counts of assaulting an emergency worker against two attending police officers and criminal damage by destroying multiple packs of beer and a Perspex screen.

He has been bailed to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on 12 October, with conditions not to contact any member of staff at the Tesco store in Serpentine Green, not to go to the Serpentine Green shopping centre or any Tesco store in the UK.
