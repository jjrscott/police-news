Police have identified a man who died following a single-vehicle crash on the A1303 at Bottisham yesterday morning (7 January).

Michael Carson, 75, of St Bartholomew's Court, Cambridge, was driving his red Mazda 3 at about 9.45am when it left the road and crashed into a tree.

Emergency services attempted to save Mr Carson's life but he was declared dead at the scene a short time later.

No other vehicle or person was involved in the collision.

Mr Carson was due to stand trial at Peterborough Crown Court, beginning yesterday, on multiple sexual assault charges alleged to have happened between 1978 and 2009.

The victims have been informed and efforts are being made to contact all the witnesses.

Anyone who saw the collision or has dash cam footage should call 101, quoting incident 100 of 7 January.
