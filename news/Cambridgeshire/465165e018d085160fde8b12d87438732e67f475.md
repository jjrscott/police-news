A dispersal order has been put in place in Peterborough this weekend in a bid to reduce crime and disorder.

The measure has been taken by the local neighbourhood policing team in response to information about youth-gang related tensions and possible disorder.

The order is in effect from 5pm today (28 August) until 8am on Monday (31 August) and covers the Peterborough areas of Dogsthorpe, Gunthorpe, New England and Paston. Areas are marked on the attached map.

The above areas are encompassed by Gunthorpe Road to the A15, Welland Road, across to Fulbridge Road and up to Gunthorpe Road.

Chief Inspector, Nick Church, said: "We're aware of potential youth-gang tensions and disorder in Peterborough this weekend and the dispersal order gives us the power to make anyone we suspect of being involved to leave the area with immediate effect and not to return within a specified period."

The order has been granted under section 35 of the Anti-Social Behaviour, crime and Policing Act 2014, and allows officers to direct a person to leave the area specified within the order if they have reasonable grounds to suspect that their behaviour has caused, or is likely to cause, harassment, alarm or distress to members of the public. Failure to comply with the order can result in arrest.
