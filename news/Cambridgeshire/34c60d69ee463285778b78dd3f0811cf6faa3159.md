Detectives investigating a burglary have released CCTV images of two men they would like to speak to.

A house in Victoria Street, Littleport, was entered through an insecure door on the afternoon of 10 August.

While inside thieves stole a piggy bank, a set of keys and a purse but made off when they were disturbed by a neighbour.

DC Henry Longhurst, who is investigating, said: "I would urge members of the public to come forward if they have any information about the burglary or recognise either of the men pictured."
