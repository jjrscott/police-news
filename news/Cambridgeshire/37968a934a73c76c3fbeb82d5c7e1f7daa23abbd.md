We have released CCTV images of a man we want to identify in connection with an attempted burglary in Peterborough last month (February).

At about 3.15pm on Monday, 12 February, a man smashed a rear window of a house in Princes Street, but ran off when the occupant, a woman in her 30s, confronted him.
