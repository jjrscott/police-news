A man has been sentenced for racist coronavirus assault and criminal damage.

Tristram Johnson, 41, of no fixed abode, hit a takeaway worker over the head with an umbrella in Huntingdon High Street on 28 March, telling him 'that's for bringing the coronavirus'.

He then told the victim he would 'come back and burn your shop next' before throwing a large rock through the window.

He was arrested a short while later and while in his custody cell he smeared excrement over the walls and smashed a police mobile phone.

At Huntingdon Crown Court yesterday (22 February) Johnson was sentenced to 10 months suspended for two years and must pay Â£500 compensation after previously pleading guilty to racially aggravated common assault, racially aggravated criminal damage and criminal damage.

Detective Constable Louise Trippett said: "These were unprovoked attacks on innocent members of our community. There is no place in our county for this kind of behaviour."

Cambridgeshire Constabulary does not tolerate hate crime and we urge you to report all incidents.
