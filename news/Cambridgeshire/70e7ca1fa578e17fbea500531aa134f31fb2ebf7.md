A call from a member of the public in Peterborough has resulted in two arrests in connection with drug supply.

We were called at about 4.30am this morning with reports of a suspicious vehicle in Dogsthorpe and concerns around potential drug dealing.

We came across a vehicle matching the description in Weymouth Way and found two teenage boys inside, along with several bags of cannabis, drugs paraphernalia, Â£125 in cash and a knife under the driver's seat.

The teenagers, aged 15 and 16, were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply cannabis as well as possession of a knife and are in custody at Thorpe Wood Police Station.

Anyone with concerns around drug dealing can report information online. Always dial 999 if you believe a crime is in action.
