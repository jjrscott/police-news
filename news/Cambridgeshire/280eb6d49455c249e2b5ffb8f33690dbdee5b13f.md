We are appealing for information following a robbery in Peterborough last week.

The victim, a 14-year old boy, was on his electric scooter in Star Road, Eastgate, at about 9.30pm on Thursday, 25 February when he was approached by a group of eight people wearing balaclavas.

The group pushed the teenager to the ground, causing him to injure his knee, before stealing his scooter.

Anyone with information is urged to report to us online or through our online webchat function and quote crime reference 35/11496/21. Those without access to the internet should call 101.
