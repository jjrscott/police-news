Detectives investigating an assault in Cambridge last month are appealing for information from the public.

Officers were called by CCTV operators who had witnessed a group of people assaulting a man outside a nightclub in Sidney Street at about 9.30pm on 21 October.

The victim, who is in his 50s, required hospital treatment as a result of the attack.

DC Joseph Fourie, who is investigating, said: "This was a nasty, unprovoked attack on a man who was simply minding his own business.

"I am urging anybody with information, or who recognises those pictured, to get in touch."

Anyone with information should contact police either by speaking to a web-chat operator on our website www.cambs.police.uk/report quoting 35/71808/20 or, if you do not have access to a computer, by calling 101.
