Detectives have released CCTV footage of the moment four masked men smashed their way into a jewellery shop in Ely.

Police were called at about 2.50am this morning (13 November) to reports of a break in at The Italian Jewellers in High Street Passage.

The thieves ransacked the store before making off with more than Â£100,000 worth of rings and watches.

Detective Sergeant Ashley Ryan, who is investigating, said: "This was a smash and grab which saw a staggering amount of jewellery stolen in a matter of minutes.

"I'm urging anybody who has any information about the incident, or who recognises the men, to get in touch as a matter of urgency."

Anyone with information should contact police either by speaking to a web-chat operator on our website www.cambs.police.uk/report quoting 35/77184/20 or, if you do not have access to a computer, by calling 101.
