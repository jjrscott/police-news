A man is due in court today (Friday) in connection with the supply of heroin and crack cocaine in Peterborough.

A 21-year-old man was arrested in Springfield Road, Millfield, yesterday afternoon (Thursday) after officers found 55 wraps of crack cocaine and 84 wraps of heroin.

The officers had attempted to stop a vehicle due to its manner of driving but the occupants made off.

He has been charged with possession with intent to supply heroin and crack cocaine, and has been remanded in custody to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court today.

A second man was arrested but later released under investigation.

Members of the public with information or concerns about drug dealing where they live are urged to report to us online.
