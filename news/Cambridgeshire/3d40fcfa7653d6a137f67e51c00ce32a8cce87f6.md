A drug dealer who hid cocaine in his bottom as police arrived to search his home has been jailed.

Acting on intelligence received from members of the public, officers carried out a warrant at Marcus Matelot's home in Consort Avenue, Trumpington on 17 June.

The 33-year-old was arrested after cannabis, white powder and other drug paraphernalia were found in the property.

Matelot told officers he did not need to be searched as he was already naked but while at the police station he produced a bundle of cocaine with a street value of Â£200.

At Cambridge Crown Court today (16 July) he pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply cocaine and possession of cannabis and was sentenced to more than five and a half years in prison (2,045 days).

PC Ross Spalthoff said: "Matelot is a notorious drug dealer who has only recently been released from prison for similar offences.

"We have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to drugs and removing dealers like Matelot from the streets of Cambridge remains one of our priorities."
