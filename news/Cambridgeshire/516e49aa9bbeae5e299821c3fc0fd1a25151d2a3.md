A man and woman who burgled a Boots chemist in Peterborough have been jailed.

William Thornton, 44, and Nicole Forbes, 31, were arrested in Long Causeway on 25 July following a break-in at the Queensgate store where doors were forced open to gain entry.

The following day, Forbes was charged with non-dwelling burglary including theft of toiletries worth £54.42.

Thornton was charged with non-dwelling burglary including theft of toiletries worth £124.47, a second non-dwelling burglary at the same Boots store on 22 July including theft of toiletries worth £101, and possession of cannabis.

The pair both admitted the offences in court on 27 July and were remanded until their sentencing dates.

Thorton, of Padholme Road, appeared at Peterborough Crown Court on Tuesday (22 September) and was sentenced to a total of 24 week in prison.

Forbes, of no fixed address, appeared at Cambridge Crown Court today (Monday 28 September) and was sentenced to 16 weeks in prison.

DC Chris Herring said: "In interview Forbes admitted being dependant on alcohol and had stolen the items in exchange for £15 to fund her habit.

"I hope the sentences will give both Thornton and Forbes chance to reflect on their actions and get the help they need to get their lives on the right track."
