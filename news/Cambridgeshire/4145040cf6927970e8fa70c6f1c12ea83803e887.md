We are appealing for information after an elderly couple in Dogsthorpe were left the victims of a distraction burglary.

The couple, who are both in their 70s, were at their home in Broom Close at about 10.30am on Friday (3 April) when a man let himself into their home.

At first the female victim believed him to be a carer for her husband, however the man then asked about an old cabinet which was outside the property and whether she wanted it moving.

The man, who is described as white, slim, about 5' 10" and about 45-years-old, left but later returned with a girl who is described as white, about 5' 3", chubby, about 16-years-old and was wearing a pink jacket.

The female victim again showed the man to the cabinet, while the young woman was left inside the home with the victim's partially blind and disabled husband.

On returning inside the home, both suspects left in a hurry before the victim noticed her purse containing cash and a photo of her husband had been stolen from the living room.

Anyone with information about this incident, or believes they may recognise the description of the offenders, is asked to contact us either by calling 101 or reporting online at www.cambs.police.uk/report and quoting 35/23219/20.
