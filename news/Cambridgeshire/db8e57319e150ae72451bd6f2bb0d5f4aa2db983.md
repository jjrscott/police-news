We are appealing for information following a violent incident outside the YMCA in Cambridge this weekend.

We were alerted to a fight in the car park of the YMCA in Gonville Place at about 7.20pm on Friday evening (15 January).

It is believed weapons were used and two people suffered serious injuries as a result of the violence.

DI Dave Savill said: "We have identified one of the men involved, however there are significant concerns for the welfare of the other man who we believe was seriously injured during this incident, therefore my plea is for that individual to either get in touch with us, or seek urgent medical assistance.

"I would also like to ask members of the public who witnessed this incident, or have information about who the injured man might be, to get in touch with us."

Anyone with information is urged to contact us online either at www.cambs.police.uk/report, or using the online web chat function and quoting incident 381 of 15 January. Those who do not have access to the internet shall call 101.

An 18-year-old man from Cambridge was arrested in connection with the incident, however he has since been released from custody pending further investigation.
