A drugs warrant was executed by police in Star Road early this morning (10 February).

Acting on intelligence, officers from the Peterborough Neighbourhood Policing Team paid a visit to the property in Eastgate.

They uncovered evidence of drug dealing and spoke to seven occupants at the scene.

PC Glen Fovargue said: "Gaining intelligence is a crucial part of what we do and the warrant this morning will help us in the battle against drugs in Peterborough.

"Drugs can ruin lives and bring associated crime to our communities. We are working hard to tackle this issue and urge the public to continue to report any concerns to us."

A 30 year old woman was arrested on suspicion of theft and is now in custody at Thorpe Wood Police Station.
