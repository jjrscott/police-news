Police are appealing for information following a burglary at the Co-operative store in North Street, Burwell.

The alarm was triggered at about 2am today (24 May). When officers arrived there was no one around but evidence of a break-in at the back of the building.

Officers discovered that a large quantity of cigarettes had been taken.

They are looking into possible links between this incident and a similar burglary where cigarettes were taken from a Tesco store, in St Ives, overnight on 22 May.

Anyone with information should contact police on 101, quoting incident 34 of 24 May or alternatively report it online at www.cambs.police.uk/report.
