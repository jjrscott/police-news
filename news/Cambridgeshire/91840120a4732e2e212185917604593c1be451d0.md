A woman whose dog was dangerously out of control and injured a neighbour's son has been sentenced.

Juliet Knight, 55, was leaving her property in Jubilee Way, Royston, on 15 October when her dog ran from the house into the front garden.

The dog then managed to escape under the bushes to a neighbouring garden and through a gate to a footpath where it bit the victim on the leg.

The victim's mother took him to a local GP surgery where he received treatment for a small puncture wound to his thigh.

On Monday (15 June) at Cambridge Crown Court Knight, of Jubilee Way, Royston, pleaded guilty to being in charge of a dog dangerously out of control and was sentenced to 20-months in prison, suspended for 24 months. She was also ordered to pay Â£200 compensation to the victim.

PC Daniel Yip, who investigated, said: "Knight admitted she was in charge of the dog and it was out of control. She stated she hadn't managed to let him out in the morning.

"I am glad she has taken responsibility for her actions and I hope something like this doesn't happen again."
