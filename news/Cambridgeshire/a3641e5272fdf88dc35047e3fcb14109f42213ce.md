Officers have released an Evofit image of a man they would like to speak to in connection with a sexual assault in Cambridge.

The incident took place on Sunday (18 August) between 1.05am and 1.20am in Barnwell Road, when the victim, a woman in her 20s, was approached by a man.

He asked her to go back to his house and when she refused he knocked her to the ground and got on top of her. The woman kicked him and he made off on foot.

The man is described as mixed race, late 20s to early 30s, average build and approximately 5'9". He had short, dark shaved hair, a short beard and spoke with a non-English accent. The man was wearing a dark coloured hoodie and trousers.

Detective Inspector Susie Hine said: "We would like to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and may have seen this man. Anyone who recognises the man pictured is asked to call police on 101."

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting reference 35NT/58845/19. Alternatively, you can report online.

Further advice on personal safety and staying safe at night.
