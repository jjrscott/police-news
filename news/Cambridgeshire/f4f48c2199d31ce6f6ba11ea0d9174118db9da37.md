A man from Peterborough has been jailed for 16 months after a pub attack which left the victim scarred for life.

Adam Boon, 32, was talking to the man, who was in his 30s, in The Vine pub in South Green, Peterborough when an argument broke out at about 11pm on 7 July.

Boon threw a pint glass in the victim's face and punched him several times, knocking him off a barstool onto the floor where he continued to punch him.

Boon was thrown out of the pub and the victim was taken to Peterborough City Hospital where he received stitches.

Boon was arrested the following morning at his home in North Green, Whittlesey, after he was identified from CCTV images from the pub.

He appeared at Peterborough Crown Court yesterday (26 September) and was sentenced after pleading guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm without intent.

DC Jon Edwards said: "This was an unprovoked attack that has left the victim understandably shaken and with some serious injuries.

"This is an example of how a split-second decision can have serious consequences."

Jailed: Adam Boon
