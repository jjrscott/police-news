A man who has persistently committed anti-social behaviour in Cambridge city centre has been issued with a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO).

Kevin MacDonald, 34, of no fixed abode, was given the order following incidents where he was threatening and abusive towards people in the city.

The order was issued at Cambridge Magistrates' Court on 2 October and lasts for 18 months. It stipulates that MacDonald must:

 * Not enter any building, car park or area of the Grand Arcade
 * Not go to Jordan's Yard, Park Street, Queen Anne, Grafton West and East car parks
 * Not go to St Andrew's Street
 * Leave any premises or public areas immediately upon the reasonable verbal request of a PC or PCSO

MacDonald was given an eight week sentence, suspended for 12 months on 2 October after pleading guilty to two public order offences and an assault by beating.

PC Jamie Tumber said: "MacDonald's behaviour has been problematic for businesses and extremely unpleasant and intimidating for people to experience and causes a significant impact upon the city centre.

"We hope the CBO will support businesses and the public by allowing us to manage and control his offending and anti-social behaviour."

Anyone who witnesses MacDonald breaching these conditions should call police on 101.
