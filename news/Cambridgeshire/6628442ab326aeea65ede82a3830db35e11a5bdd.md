A man has been jailed for more than six years for firearms and drugs offences.

Calvin Jackson, 26, appeared at Peterborough Crown Court last Thursday (6 December) after pleading guilty to possession of a firearm, possession of ammunition without a license, possession of an offensive weapon in a public place and production of cannabis.

The court heard how officers carried out a warrant at Jackson's house in Uldale Way, Gunthorpe, Peterborough, after they received intelligence he had bought illegal firearms and ammunition online.

Officers executed the warrant on 6 November, during which two handguns, 200 rounds of ammunition and Â£2,800 worth of cannabis were seized.

DI Nick Cook said: "Guns and drugs can have devastating effects on people's lives, making it all the more important we catch perpetrators and bring them to justice.

"This operation is a prime example of officers acting on intelligence to remove a dangerous man from our streets.

 "I would like to thank those involved for their dogged determination to see this through to a successful conclusion. This sentence reflects how seriously we and the courts take offences like these."
