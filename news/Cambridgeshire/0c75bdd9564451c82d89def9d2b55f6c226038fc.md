```

We have released a CCTV image of a man we would like to speak to in connection with an attempted burglary in Milton.

A man approached a property on The Sycamores on 11 December and looked through the windows before trying to force open the front door.

He ran away after being disturbed by the home owner.

Detective Sergeant James Rabbett, said: "This is a high quality image of the person we wish to speak to in connection with this incident and we urge members of the public to think carefully and contact police if they recognise the man or have any information in relation to the incident."

Anyone with any information should call police on 101, quoting crime reference number CC-11122019-0299.
