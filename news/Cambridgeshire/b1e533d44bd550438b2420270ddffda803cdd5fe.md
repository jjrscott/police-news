We are appealing for witnesses after a shop was burgled in Isleham.

At about 11.25pm last night (20 March), up to five men in balaclavas used sledge hammers to smash the window of the Co-Op in West Street.

They stole cigarettes from behind the till and made off in a coupe style vehicle along Mill Street and Malting Lane.

Detective Sergeant Emma Smith said: "I'm keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and may have seen these men or the vehicle in the moments leading up to and after the burglary."

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting reference CF0150400318. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
