A woman who tried to deliver thousands of pounds worth of drugs to an inmate at HMP Whitemoor by concealing them about her person has been jailed.

Charlotte Burgess, 40, visited an inmate at the prison on 9 November 2018.

At the end of the visit the pair embraced and began kissing. They then put their hands down each other's trousers before prison officers pulled them apart and searched them.

Burgess was taken to Thorpe Wood Police Station, where officers discovered she was wearing two bras and two pairs of pants. They also discovered a package containing thousands of pounds worth of drugs including cannabis and Spice.

Burgess, of Manger Road, Holloway, London, pleaded guilty to two counts of bringing a prohibited item into prison and breach of bail and was sentenced to a total of seven months in prison at Peterborough Crown Court yesterday (11 May).

DC Fran Scott, investigating, said: "Burgess thought she could pull the wool over the eyes of the prison officers that day.

"I hope this goes to show how seriously we take these sorts of crimes and, along with the prison staff, will do all we can to prevent prohibited items from making it into prisons."
