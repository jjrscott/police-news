The Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit will feature a poppy on all of their marked patrol vehicles in the build up to remembrance Sunday.

The idea was put forward by PC Mark Fairclough and ACC Paul Fullwood, both of whom served with HM forces before joining the force.

PC Fairclough said: "I was pleased to receive such tremendous support for this idea to remember our fallen service personnel and show our respects for the ultimate sacrifice they made.

"I did not want to force this idea on anyone, but received positive feedback from every officer that I have spoken to about making this idea a reality".

The poppy will feature on the vehicles to commemorate the 100-year anniversary of the end of World War 1 on 11 November, 1918.

ACC Fullwood said: "I am proud to support the centennial Remembrance Day with this gesture.

"This is certainly not a glorification of war. We will be supporting the British Legion in their poppy appeal as we show our respects on this momentous anniversary."
