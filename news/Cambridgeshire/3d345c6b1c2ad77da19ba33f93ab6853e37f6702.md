Cambridgeshire Constabulary has today (Friday, 22 December), published a report outlining the pay gap between male and female employees in efforts to better understand the figures and ensure we can continue to be an employer of choice in the Eastern Region.

The Constabulary is committed to the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment for all employees, regardless of the protected characteristics they share or their personal circumstances.

We are pleased that the Constabulary has a gender pay gap lower than national figures. However we accept there is more to do to fully embrace gender parity particularly at senior levels.

There is not a simple, easy or quick fix; gender pay gaps are the outcome of economic, cultural, societal and educational factors. We are a public service organisation and need to reflect the communities we serve.

There is no doubt we are on a journey, with a long road ahead, but we are proud of the steps the organisation has taken, and plan to take, to redress any imbalances. In doing so we have witnessed the benefits diversity and inclusion brings to this organisation.
