We have been contacted about two robberies at a branch of Ladbrokes in Skaters Way in the last week.

The first incident took place at about 9.30pm on Wednesday (28 March) and the second yesterday (2 April) at about 5.15pm.

On both occasions a man entered the bookmakers, threatened staff and demanded money. Each time they left with a quantity of cash. During the second incident a tablet computer was also stolen.

The man in the first incident is described as white, aged 21-40 and 5'11" to 6'. He was wearing a green jacket and a dark coloured beanie.

The man involved in the second incident is described as white, but with a tan, 5'9", stocky build, with stubble and aged roughly 30. He was wearing a black hoodie, jeans and a beanie hat.

Scenes of crime officers have attended to explore forensic opportunities and an investigation is ongoing.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who has private CCTV that may have captured the suspects or dashcam footage of the area at the time of the offences.
