Two teenagers have been charged with burglary after we received a concerned call from a member of the public.

In the early hours of Friday morning (22 January), we were called about a suspected burglary in progress in West Town, Peterborough.

An 18-year-old man from Doncaster was arrested and has been charged with attempted burglary with intent to steal.

A 16-year-old boy from Peterborough was also arrested and has been charged with burglary, including theft of a purse and a set of car keys, as well as attempted burglary with intent to steal.

Both were remanded to appear at Huntingdon Magistrates' Court on Saturday (23 January). The 18-year-old has been released on court bail to appear at Peterborough Crown Court on 19 February.

The 16-year-old has been bailed to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on 3 February.

They must both wear an electronic tag to enable police to monitor their movements and compliance with bail conditions including an overnight curfew.
