Police are appealing for information following a serious single-vehicle collision in Peterborough last night.

Emergency services were called to Bakewell Road, Orton Southgate just before 10pm with reports a Honda moped had left the road and collided with a tree.

One of the riders, a man in his 20s, was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge where he remains in a critical condition.

The other rider, a man in his teens, was taken to Peterborough City Hospital after suffering serious but not life-threatening injuries.

Police would like to hear from anyone who was in the area and witnessed the collision, saw the vehicle beforehand or who has dashcam footage from the area. Call 101 quoting Op Garbo or report online.
