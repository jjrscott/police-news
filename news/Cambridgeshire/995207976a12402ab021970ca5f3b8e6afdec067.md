Trick-or-treaters are being urged to respect their neighbours this Halloween.

October 31 is traditionally a night of fun and frolics with children dressed up as ghosts, witches and assorted monsters knocking on doors saying 'Trick or Treat'.

While many householders are happy to hand over sweets or other presents to ward off the evil spirits it's important to remember that not everybody wants strangers knocking on their doors.

Inspector Paul Rogerson said: "For vulnerable or older members of the community Halloween can be a frightening and intimidating experience.

"We have created a poster people can download and display in their homes asking trick-or-treaters not to call as well as some tips for trick-or-treaters to ensure everyone has a pleasant evening."

 * Ensure children are accompanied by a responsible adult
 * Explain how vulnerable people can be frightened by an unexpected group calling at their door on a dark evening
 * Only knock at houses where you know you will be welcome
 * Respect any 'no trick-or-treating' notices displayed

Download a copy of the poster online. Copies will also be available for collection at our police stations.
