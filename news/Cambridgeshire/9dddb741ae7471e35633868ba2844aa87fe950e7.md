A registered sex offender breached his notification requirements by sleeping at the same address as a young child.

Jack Slater, 34, admitted to officers from the Public Protection Unit (PPU) based in the north of the county that he had breached his notification requirements on December 4 and 5.

Slater attended Thorpe Wood Police Station on 16 December and in interview told the officers he had spent two days at a property in Peterborough where a four-year-old girl also lived.

Detective Sergeant Paul Stimpson, from the Northern PPU, said: "All registered sex offenders have to abide by certain restrictions. One of Slater's is that he has to notify us if he is going to be staying anywhere for a period longer than twelve hours where a child under the age of 18 is present."

Slater, of Gunthorpe, Peterborough, pleaded guilty to failing to comply with the notification requirements of the Sex Offenders Register.

He was sentenced at Peterborough Crown Court on Wednesday (10 June) to an 18-month community order, 20 days Rehabilitation Activity Requirement, 60 hours unpaid work, costs of Â£430 and had his time on the Sex Offenders Register extended by two years.

Anyone who is concerned someone may have been convicted of a sex offence, and could be posing a risk to someone, can apply for disclosure information through Clare's Law and Sarah's Law.

More information on sexual offences and the Sex Offenders Register can be found on the force website.
