Police are appealing for witnesses following a ram raid in St Ives during the early hours of today (27 September).

Officers were called at 3.16am to reports of a ram raid at the Co-Op in Constable Road, St Ives.

Offenders raid the store and stole a cash machine before leaving in a grey Audi S3 Quattro and a blue Mazda B2500 Escape.

Officers followed the vehicles but were unable to trace them.

Det Sgt Dan Cooper said: "This was clearly a planned incident, with those responsible showing little regard for the safety of the public.

"I would urge anyone with information about the incident or those responsible to contact us."

Anyone with information is asked to call on 101 quoting 35/33126/18 or report online at cambs.police.uk/report. Alternatively, you can report anonymously at www.crimestoppers-uk.org/
