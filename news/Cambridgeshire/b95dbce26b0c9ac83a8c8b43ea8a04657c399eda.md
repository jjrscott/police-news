The family of a man who was murdered in Wisbech earlier this week have released a photo and tribute.

Tom Lewis, 23, of Larksfield in Wisbech, was airlifted to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge from Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Kings Lynn on Tuesday (8 September) to undergo surgery to his leg.

He was placed on life-support in intensive care but was pronounced dead yesterday afternoon (Thursday 10 September) after a decision was made to end his life-support treatment.

His family said: "Our life with our son Tommy ended yesterday because of an act of violence. He was only 23 years old, and he was a much-loved son. Our hearts are broken.

"Tommy was also a father, brother, grandson and uncle and loved by all who knew him. He was funny, kind and would help anyone, he was also a loyal friend. He will be forever missed."

Three men, aged 22 and two aged 32, who were arrested in connection with Tom's death remain in custody. A fourth man, aged 18, was arrested in Milton Keynes last night, also in connection with the murder.
