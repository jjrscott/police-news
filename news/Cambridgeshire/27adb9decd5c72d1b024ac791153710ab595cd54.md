Police have seized a suspected firearm following a raid in Cambridge.

Officers, along with PD Bailey, entered the flat in Vinter Terrace at about 7pm yesterday (17 December) under Section 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act and found the weapon, bundles of cash and a bag of cannabis residue.

A 31-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of drug and firearms offences and remains in custody at Parkside.

PC Sean Tanvir, of the Cambridge City Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "Ridding our streets of drugs and weapons is a priority for the force.

"I hope yesterday's warrant provides some reassurance to the public that we will continue to crack down on drugs and associated criminality."

Anyone with information about unlawful weapons can report it to us online.

The Government has recently launched a scheme that allows members of the public to surrender illegal weapons.
