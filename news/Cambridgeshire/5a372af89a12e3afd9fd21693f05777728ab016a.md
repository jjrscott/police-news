A pair of brothers have admitted to stealing bike parts in Cambridge.

Pietro and Carlo Merolla were spotted on CCTV stealing a set of bike panniers and a bike seat on Regents Terrace on 7 September.

They were followed by CCTV operators who watched them looking for other insecure items and bikes until police caught up with them.

Pietro, 35, of Histon Road, and Carlo, 40 of Lovell Road, were found in possession of two screwdrivers, a set of bike panniers, a bike seat post with a saddle attached and two bike lights.

They appeared at Cambridge Magistrates' Court on Thursday (10 December) where they pleaded guilty to theft and going equipped for theft and handed a £230 fine each, £85 costs and a £34 victim surcharge.

PC Wadsworth said: "We know that bike related theft is a priority for members of our community and we're committed to tackling it and putting those responsible before the courts."
