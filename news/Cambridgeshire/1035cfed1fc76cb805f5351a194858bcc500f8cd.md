A London drug dealer who asked police for directions has been jailed for 30 months.

Tyrell De Oliveira, of Harman Rise, Ilford, drew attention to himself when he asked police for directions to an address in Coldhams Lane, Cambridge just after midnight on 19 August.

The 22-year-old was then seen again a couple of hours later cycling around the city.

Officers observed De Oliveira and saw him place a bag into a bush in the Cambridge Retail Park.

They decided to stop and question him and found class A drugs, pills, mobile phones and cash in his trousers and bag.

At Cambridge Crown Court on Thursday (15 October) De Oliveira was sentenced to 30 months in prison after previously pleading guilty to possession with intent to supply crack cocaine and heroin.

Detective Constable Kenny Reeves said: "The officers were quite right to suspect something wasn't right when they spotted De Oliveira riding around the city so late at night.

"We all have a part to play in keeping our local areas safe from drug dealing. If you suspect drug dealing at a house or in your area, please report it to us online."
