Police are appealing for information after man was attacked and left with serious injuries in St Ives.

The 19-year-old had gone to collect his bike after a night out from The Quay, a street by the river, between 12.30am and 1.45am on Saturday (27 July) when he was attacked by another man.

Officers in the nearby area were led to the scene by a member of public, where they found the victim unconscious. He was taken to hospital where he received stitches and was found to have a fractured bone.

DC Neil Patrick said "This was an unprovoked attack on a man who was out to enjoy an evening with his friend.

"If you were out on Friday night into Saturday morning in this area and have any information, please come forward and help with our enquiries. We are particularly keen to speak with a group of men who had a confrontation with a man in the Tap Room on Bridge Street around this time, as they may have vital information that will assist with our enquiries."

If you have any information, please call Huntingdon CID on 101, quoting crime reference 35/53317/19.

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111. Report online at https://www.cambs.police.uk/report
