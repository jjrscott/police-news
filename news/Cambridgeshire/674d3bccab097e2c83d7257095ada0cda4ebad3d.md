A man from Orton Malborne has admitted stealing more than £1,200 worth of meat from an M&S Food Hall in Peterborough.

The following day he was charged with ten counts of theft from M&S Food Hall in Serpentine Green, Hampton, mostly meat amounting to more than £1,200, as well as the theft of a bicycle from outside a shop in Hereward Cross on 5 May.

Sardeson, of Blackmead, admitted all charges at Huntingdon Magistrates' Court on Saturday (30 May) and was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months.

He has also been ordered to pay £80 compensation to the owner of the bike he stole, plus £1,742 to Marks and Spencer.

He must also complete a six-month drug rehabilitation requirement and a 30-day rehabilitation activity requirement.
