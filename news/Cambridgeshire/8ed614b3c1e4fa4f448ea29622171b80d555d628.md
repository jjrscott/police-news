A Cambridge home has been issued with a closure order following police action.

The order was issued to 84 William Smith Close today (28 January) after a successful application from police to Cambridge Magistrates' Court.

The action came as a result of frequent reports of anti-social behaviour, drug use and criminal activity.

A closure order was granted and the property will be closed for three months.

PC Adam Price from the City East Neighbourhood Team said: "Over a prolonged period of time, there have been persistent reports and information relating to people visiting the address including drug use, dealing, noise and intimidating behaviour.

"We hope that preventing visitors will significantly reduce the impact on the local residents and allow them and their families to be in their homes without feeling intimidated."

The closure order states the house be closed in accordance with the Anti-Social Behaviour and Policing Act 2014 and only permits access to the tenant and emergency services until 28 April. If anyone is found on the premises unlawfully they render themselves liable to arrest.
