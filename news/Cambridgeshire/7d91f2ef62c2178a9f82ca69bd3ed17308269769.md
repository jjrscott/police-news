Villagers are being urged to be vigilant to suspicious activity in their communities following a number of church break-ins.

At some point between Saturday and Sunday (6-7 February) four churches were broken in to. Although nothing of value is thought to have been stolen, residents are being urged to be the eyes and ears of the community and report unusual activity to police.

Thieves broke in to St Peter's Church in Main Street, Wentworth, St Michael and All Angels Church in Chettisham, St Mary's Church in Church Street, Ely and St Andrew's Church in Main Street, Witchford.

East Cambs Neighbourhood Sergeant, Mark Rabel, said: "Officers have been in touch with the churches affected and others in the area to offer crime prevention and security advice.

"We'd like to ask our communities, who are now spending more time than ever at home and within their local neighbourhoods, to look out for any suspicious activity and report it to us. If you see a crime in progress, call 999."

Anyone with information is asked to speak to police via our web-chat or call 101 quoting references 35/7459/21, 35/7445/21, 35/7448/21 and 35/7447/21.
