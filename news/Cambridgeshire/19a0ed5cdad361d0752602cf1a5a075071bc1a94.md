A man has been charged in connection with bike theft in Cambridge.

The 21-year-old was arrested by officers in Sidney Street in the early hours of Wednesday morning (21 October).

He has since been charged with going equipped for theft and will appear at Cambridge Magistrates' Court today (22 October).

Yesterday evening officers from the Cambridge neighbourhood team arrested a 36-year-old man in Peas Hill on suspicion of bike theft and going equipped. He remains in custody at Thorpe Wood Police Station.

A third man, aged 20, was also arrested yesterday in Drummer Street on suspicion of bike theft and going equipped. He has been bailed to return to Thorpe Wood Police Station on 5 November.

Inspector Ed McNeil from the city neighbourhood team said: "We take all reports of bike theft seriously and would encourage people to report offences so we can build up a picture and deploy resources accordingly.

"We would also encourage cyclists to take precautionary steps to reduce the risk of becoming a victim."
