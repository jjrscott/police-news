Officers investigating a fraud series at fuel stations in Peterborough have released CCTV images of people they would like to speak in connection with the incidents.

The incidents took place between 21 July and 3 December at fuel stations in Carr Road, Fengate and Whittlesey Road, Stanground.

People claimed they were unable to pay for fuel and that they would return. However, they gave false information and left without paying.

During a three month period, officers have received more than 40 reports of suspected fuel theft in the area.

Anyone who recognises the people pictured, or who has any information, is asked to call police on 101 quoting 35/83253/19. Alternatively, you can report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report.
