A man who was caught with class A drugs stashed inside a Kinder Egg has been jailed.

Victor Carvalho, 36, was spotted acting suspiciously near the scene of a separate incident on 3 January last year.

Officers approached Carvalho in Park Street, New Fletton, Peterborough. He was searched, but nothing was discovered.

However, when officers searched his vehicle, which was nearby, they found a Kinder Egg containing class A drugs in the driver's door.

The drugs were examined and they were found to be 35 wraps of heroin and 17 wraps of crack cocaine.

Carvalho, of Gainsborough Road, Corby, pleaded guilty to two counts of possession with intent to supply class A drugs at Peterborough Crown Court on Thursday (5 March). He was jailed for three years and nine months.

DC Paul Twell said: "Drugs devastate lives and cause misery for our communities.

"Often drug dealing and violence go hand-in-hand, making it vital that we catch the perpetrators and bring them to justice."
