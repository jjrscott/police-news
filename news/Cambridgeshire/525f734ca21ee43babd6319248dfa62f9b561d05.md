Drugs with a potential value of up to more than £1.72million have been seized from a house in Peterborough today (Wednesday 16 September).

The Community Action Team executed a warrant in Hinchcliffe, Orton Goldhay, this morning where they discovered a total of 2,049 cannabis plants, 1,989 of which were 'baby' plants.

These have been valued as having a potential street value in excess of £1.72million if grown to full maturity.

A 28-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the production of cannabis and is currently in custody at Thorpe Wood Police Station.
