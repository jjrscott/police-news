Police have released CCTV of a man they want to trace in connection with a spate of thefts from electricity sub-stations in Cambridgeshire.

The man is being sought by police in relation to at least 13 thefts of batteries from sub-stations across the county - with incidents of thefts in Toft, Huntingdon, Kennett and Burwell.

A large number of batteries have been stolen - with crimes also further afield in Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Essex.

The incidents took place between May and August.

Substantial damage has also been caused to the buildings in order to gain access and carry out the thefts.

Officers are keen to identify the man in the CCTV and urge anyone who may know who he is to pass on information by reporting it online at www.cambs.police.uk/report and quote 35/24813/18, or calling 101.

Do you recognise this man?
