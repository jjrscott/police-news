A man walking around Huntingdon with a baseball bat has been convicted.

Rhys Walton, 29, of St Mary's Street, Huntingdon was seen by members of the public and an off duty police officer walking round the town on 18 January.

After hearing Walton say 'I'll batter him', the concerned member of the public called police and the 29-year-old was arrested in Elter Water.

At Peterborough Magistrates' Court he pleaded guilty to using threatening behaviour with intent to cause fear and possession of an offensive weapon in a public place

On Monday he was sentenced to four months in prison, suspended for 18 months. He must also carry out 25 day rehabilitation activity requirement and 120 hours unpaid work.

PC Gunn said: "Carrying a weapon of any sort can put you and others in danger. The witness and off duty officer felt in imminent fear of violence and did the right thing by calling police."
