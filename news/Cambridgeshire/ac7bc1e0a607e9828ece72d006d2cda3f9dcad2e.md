Police have released CCTV images of men they want to speak with in connection with a burglary at a warehouse in Sawtry.

The burglary happened at about 3.30am on Monday, 16 October, in Old Great North Road, near the Greenfields sports field.

It is believed five men drove across fields at the back of the business to enter the site before accessing three lorries and removing pallets and a large steel bar to then gain entry to the warehouse via one of its windows.

The alarm was activated and the offenders made off. It is believed nothing was stolen.

Anyone who recognises the men in the CCTV images is asked to contact police by calling 101 or report online via www.cambs.police.uk/report quoting CF0594211017.
