A serial burglar caught on CCTV stealing from a dentist has been sent to prison.

Ricky Homer, 34, of no fixed abode, admitted breaking into a dental practice in Brampton Road, Huntingdon in June 2019 and stealing more than Â£400 as well as receipts.

The 34-year-old of no fixed abode was identified on CCTV by neighbourhood officers and arrested.

Yesterday (23 March) at Peterborough Crown Court he was sentenced to six months in prison after previously pleading guilty to burglary.

PC Callum Wade said: "Homer is a prolific burglar with a catalogue of previous convictions. It is disappointing to see when someone doesn't learn from their previous actions, despite spending time in prison.

"For as long as Homer continues to offend and not change his ways, we will continue to put him before the courts."
