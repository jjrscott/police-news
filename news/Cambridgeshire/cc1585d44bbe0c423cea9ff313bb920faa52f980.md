A pair of brothers who burgled a flat in Cambridge have been jailed.

Jacob and Joseph Hall were sentenced to two years and five months in prison after pleading guilty to burglary and theft at Cambridge Crown Court on 23 November.

On 24 October the pair used a stone to smash their way through the living room window of a flat in Morley Court off Baldock Way.

They searched the property and left with games consoles, a laptop, Apple watch and four other watches worth more than Â£4,000.

Unbeknown to the men, the victim had CCTV installed inside the property and police were able to use it to identify Jacob, 23, and Joseph, 24.

Officers arrested Jacob and Joseph from their homes the following morning in Whitehill Road and Spring Drive, Trumpington.

Detective Constable Cheryl Harris said: "Officers were able to identify these men quickly and ensure they were in custody within hours of the burglary taking place."
