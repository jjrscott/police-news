A man reported to be wielding an axe at a convenience store in Dogsthorpe has been arrested.

We were carrying out routine patrols of the area just before 12.30pm today (Friday) when the call for assistance came from AK Food Store in Central Avenue.

A member of staff at the shop was injured during the incident, however it is not deemed to be life-threatening.

A 22-year-old man from Peterborough has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and is currently in custody at Thorpe Wood Police Station.
