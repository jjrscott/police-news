A man has started a 16 week sentence after avoiding court for more than five months.

Clint Bye of no fixed abode was spotted and arrested by neighbourhood policing officers on Thursday (26 September) for failing to appear in court for sentencing on 10 April.

The 41-year-old had previously pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine, possession of a class C drug, and obstructing a police officer at Cambridge Magistrates' Court in January. He was also found guilty of going equipped.

Bye attempted to make off from officers in Salmon Lane, Cambridge on 4 January as they attempted to arrest him for a court warrant dating back to 2017. He was found with a small amount of class A and C drugs in his rucksack as well as secateurs, a metal pole and a hook.

PC Jamie Tumber from the city centre neighbourhood team said: "We're committed to finding and putting people like Bye before the courts so they can be sentenced for the crimes they have committed."
