A man sold cannabis in front of police officers in broad daylight at a Cambridge skate park.

Robert Brazier was seen handing a clear bag to a passer-by on Jesus Green at about 12.30pm on Saturday, 22 July.

Brazier, 21, was found with a quantity of cannabis split into bags ready to be sold, £110 and a mobile phone.

Officers also searched Brazier's home and found several jars and tubs of cannabis, along with £3,160 and a set of digital scales.

Brazier, of Histon Road, Cambridge, pleaded guilty to possession of cannabis with intent to supply at Cambridge Crown Court on Friday (27 July) and was sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for 24 months, 150 hours of unpaid work and a 15-day rehabilitation activity requirement.

Sgt Paul Street said: "Brazier showed a blatant disregard for the law by selling drugs so openly in a public place.

"I would urge anyone who suspects drug dealing to report it to the police so we can help to keep illegal drugs out of Cambridgeshire."
