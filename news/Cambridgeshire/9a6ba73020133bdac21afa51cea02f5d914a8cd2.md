Officers investigating an attempted robbery in Peterborough last week are appealing for witnesses.

At about 11pm on Tuesday, 24 July, a man in his 40s was walking along the footpath on the A1139 (Frank Perkins Parkway) over the River Nene when he was approached by four men on bicycles.

One of the men threatened the victim and demanded money, before he shouted out and managed to get away.

The offender is described as black, in his 20s, of slim build, with a goatee beard and wearing a baseball cap.
