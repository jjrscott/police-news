The family of a man who was killed following a collision in March on Valentine's Day have paid tribute to him.

The incident happened at just before 7.30pm on Wisbech Road and involved a car and a motorbike.

The rider of the motorbike, Eric Gowler, 34, of St Peters Road, March, suffered fatal injuries and died at the scene. The driver of the car was uninjured.

In tribute, Eric's family said: "Eric was a much-loved son, father, brother and uncle. He was a friend to many and lived life to the full.

"He would do anything to help anyone and he had a smile that would light up a room.

"Both he and his son had a passion for anything with an engine.

"He will be greatly missed by all who knew him and we would like to thank all those who helped at the scene, and for all the tributes left for Eric - he had more friends than we knew."

Police are appealing for witnesses or anyone who has dashcam footage of the moments leading up to the collision.

Anyone with information should report this via the force's web chat, report online via www.cambs.police.uk/report/ or alternatively call 101, quoting incident 341 of 14 February.
