Officers are appealing for information following an attempted robbery in Paston, Peterborough, last Tuesday (5 May).

The victim, a man in his 20s, was walking along an alleyway that leads onto Honeyhill at about 11pm when he was approached by four men, one of which was on a mobility scooter.

One of the men put a weapon to the victim's head and told him to empty his pockets.

When the victim refused, he was hit over the head with the weapon, causing minor injury to his eye, but he managed to push past the group and run home.

A 17-year-old boy from Peterborough was arrested on suspicion of attempted robbery in connection with the incident on Wednesday (6 May). He has since been bailed pending further enquiries.

DC Tessa Munro said: "This must have been a terrifying experience for the victim who was simply walking home from the supermarket.

"Although we've made one arrest, our enquiries continue and I believe there are people in the community who have information about the incident and have not yet come forward.

"I am urging anyone with information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, to get in touch."

Anyone with information should call police on 101 quoting 35/29630/20 or visit www.cambs.police.uk/report.

Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
