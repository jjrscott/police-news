A man has been jailed for driving offences days after being stopped in Cambridge.

Robert Magatsi, 44, was spotted driving along Chesterton Road by officers from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Roads Policing Unit (RPU) at about midday on Sunday (14 June).

Knowing he was wanted they stopped Magatsi in his red Citroen C3 and arrested him on suspicion of driving offences dating back to October and breaching a suspended sentence order on 19 December.

Further checks revealed he didn't hold a licence and therefore wasn't insured to drive the Citroen.

Magatsi, of Noel Murless Drive, Newmarket, appeared at Cambridge Magistrates' Court on Monday (15 June) where he admitted driving otherwise than in accordance with his licence and driving without third party insurance.

He was jailed for 14 weeks, including six weeks for breaching a previous suspended sentence order, disqualified from driving for 36 months and ordered to pay more than Â£120 in costs.

PC Stephanie Corletto from the RPU, said: "This case is a clear demonstration that even if you think you're above the law, we will catch up with you.

"Magatsi continued to drive illegally, putting the lives of innocent road users at risk, but thanks to his sentence he won't be behind the wheel of a car for some time."
