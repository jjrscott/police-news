A man who followed his ex-partner and breached a court order has been jailed.

David Crisp, 31, was handed the non-molestation order on 8 October which stated that he must not go within 100 metres of his ex-partner.

However, just four days later on 12 October this was breached.

At about 11:30am the victim noticed Crisp had posted abusive messages about her on his Facebook page.

The victim called the police to report the matter and, while she was on the phone, saw Crisp drive by the front of her house looking directly at her.

At about 5.30pm Crisp again drove by, this time shouting abuse out of the window. He then returned at about 6pm, driving slowly and looking for the victim.

The following day the victim went to church, but was confronted by Crisp who was parked outside. She called the police and he was arrested.

Crisp, of Chapel Avenue, Wisbech St Mary, pleaded guilty to breaching a non-molestation order.

On Friday (29 November) at Peterborough Crown Court he was jailed for six months.

DC Stephen Ward said: "Not only did Crisp act in an intimidating manner, he tried to stop the victim living a normal life.

"I am pleased he was caught so quickly and hopefully this sentence will give him time to think about his future."
