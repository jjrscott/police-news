Officers have released images of a man they would like to speak to in connection with an attempted burglary in Westhawe, Bretton, earlier this month.

At about 2am on Saturday, 4 April, CCTV from the victim's home captured a man trying the handle of a car.

He gained access to the car and used spare keys left in the vehicle to start the engine.

He then left the vehicle and tried to use the keys to get into the house, but left when the alarm went off.

DC Tessa Munro, said: "If you have any information about who the man in the photographs is, please get in touch as soon as possible."

Anyone with any information should call police on 101, quoting crime reference number 35/23402/20. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
