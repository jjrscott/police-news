Drugs, cash and mobile phones have been seized during a drugs raid in Cambridge.

Acting on information from the public, officers from the Special Constabulary descended on the property in Derby Street yesterday afternoon.

They entered under the Misuse of Drugs Act and seized cannabis, cash and mobile phones.

One man, aged 26, who was in the property at the time, will be interviewed in connection with possession of cannabis with intent to supply.

Three further men, two aged 27 and one aged 25, who were found near to the property, were searched and cannabis seized from them.

Special Sergeant Chris Palmius said: "The warrant was a direct result of information received from members of the public.

"The public are often our eyes and ears and it's vital they continue to report information and concerns to us."
