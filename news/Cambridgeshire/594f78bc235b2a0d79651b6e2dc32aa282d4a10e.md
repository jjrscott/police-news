Police are appealing for information after a burglary in Mayor's Walk where tools worth thousands of pounds were stolen.

The house, which is being renovated, was broken into between 17 and 19 June, with tools including a chop saw, set of chisels, drill set and a snappy tools holder being taken.

It is believed a distinctive rose gold suitcase was used by the burglar to take the items.

PC Matt Reed said: "I would urge members of the public to come forward if they have any information relating to this burglary.

"The victim has suffered a great expense in having to replenish their work tools. The suitcase is very distinctive, if anyone has seen suspicious activity or sees the stolen tools for sale please let us know."

Anyone with information should call 101 and quote 35/39951/20 or report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report.
