Plans for a community policing operation are in place for the Strawberry Fair this weekend.

We have been working closely with fair organisers and Cambridge City Council to ensure a fun, family-friendly event on Saturday (2 June).

The fair site will have perimeter fencing with only four public entrances at Maids Causeway, Walnut Tree Avenue, Victoria Road Bridge and Jesus Green.

All entrances will be staffed by stewards and there will be strict security measures in place for those wishing to enter.

No more than four cans of beer, one bottle of 75cl cider or one bottle of wine per person will be allowed on site. Spirits are not permitted and no glass will be allowed on Midsummer Common during the event.

Community police officers will be patrolling the site and neighbouring areas and CCTV will be in operation.
