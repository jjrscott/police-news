Tributes have been paid to Gail Brown nee Hickman who died in a collision on the A1307.

Gail, 56, of Lowry Close, Haverhill, died following a collision with a Ford Fiesta at about 12.15pm on Friday (22 December) on the eastbound carriageway at Bartlow.

In a statement her family - husband Ian, parents Pat and Michael, sister Lorraine and nephew David - said:

"We are totally devastated at the loss of our beautiful Gail.

"Words can't express how we feel at the moment, but we take immense comfort from all the messages of support we have received from the many, many people who knew and loved her.

"She will be sorely missed by so many people. We kindly ask for some time to grieve in private."
