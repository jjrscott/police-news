Cyclists across Cambridge are being urged to register their bikes and report any thefts.

Officers working to crackdown on cycle crime in the city have been unable to reunite owners with a haul of suspected stolen bikes because crimes haven't been reported.

On Friday officers from the Cambridge north and south neighbourhood policing teams recovered seven bikes and examined 11 others but were only able to reunite one with its rightful owner.

Detective Sergeant Kiri Mazur said: "We're working hard to address cycle crime in Cambridge. This includes reviewing and identifying bike-theft hotspots, catching offenders, recovering stolen bikes with proactive patrols and education.

"Please help us to help you. When you buy a bike, register it, and if your bike gets stolen, report it.

"We're keen to reunite these bikes with their owners and would urge anyone who has been a victim of bike theft to report the theft via our web-chat or by calling 101."
