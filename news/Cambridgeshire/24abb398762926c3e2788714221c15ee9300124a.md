A Cambridge protestor has appeared in court.

Mahoney Goodman, 21, of Long Reach Road, Cambridge appeared at Cambridge Magistrates' Court yesterday (15 September) where she pleaded guilty to obstructing/disrupting persons engaged in lawful activity.

On 21 February she climbed onto the roof of the Shell garage in Newnham Road and refused to leave causing the business to have to close.

Goodman was ordered to pay Â£100 in compensation.
