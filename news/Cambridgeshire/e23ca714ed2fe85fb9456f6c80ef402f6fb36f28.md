A dispersal order has been put in place in Wisbech in a bid to reduce crime and disorder.

The measure has been taken by the local policing team in response to a violent incident last night in Norfolk Street.

The order, which is a temporary measure, enables police to move people on from an area where they suspect their behaviour is anti-social.

The authority covers the area encompassed by Stermyn Street (at the most northerly point) the A1101 (to the east), West Street (on the western side) and Onyx Court (as the most southerly side).

The order has been granted under Section 35 of the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014, and allows for Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs) and police officers to direct a person to leave the area specified within the order if they have reasonable grounds to suspect that their behaviour has caused, or is likely to cause, harassment, alarm or distress to members of the public. Failure to comply with the order can result in arrest.

Detective Chief Inspector Dan Quigley said: "We have considered all the powers we have available to us and believe that a dispersal order will be the most effective and efficient means of preventing any further disorder.

"Failure to comply with officers will result in arrest and we will act robustly to keep the streets of Wisbech, and its residents, safe."
