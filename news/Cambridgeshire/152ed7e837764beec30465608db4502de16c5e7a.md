A man has been charged following a police pursuit in Peterborough.

At about 10pm on Saturday (5 October) officers began a pursuit with a Peugeot 307 which had failed to stop in central Peterborough.

The vehicle mounted the pavement outside Waitrose in Bourges Boulevard and the driver ran away from the scene.

Idnan Tahir, 25, of Ledbury Road, Peterborough, was arrested and later charged with dangerous driving, failing to stop, possession of cocaine and possession of cannabis. He has been released on bail to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on 7 November.
