They are accused of the murder of 30-year-old Nicky Bonner (pictured below), of Park Road, Peterborough, who died in Southfields Drive on Tuesday afternoon (5 January).

A third man, aged 18, from Peterborough, was arrested on suspicion of murder yesterday evening (7 January) and remains in custody at Thorpe Wood Police Station.

A post mortem examination carried out at Peterborough City Hospital yesterday concluded Nicky died as a result of a stab wound.
