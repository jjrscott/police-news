A man has been charged with a number of burglaries in the Whittlesey area.

Dominic Jasinski, of Sorrel Avenue, Whittlesey, was arrested yesterday afternoon (4 September) near his home address by the northern Impact Team.

Jasinski, 22, has since been charged with four counts of burglary, one count of theft and one count of fraud.

He is due to appear at Cambridge Magistrates' Court today (5 September).

A 35-year-old woman was also arrested on suspicion of burglary, however she has since been released with no further action.
