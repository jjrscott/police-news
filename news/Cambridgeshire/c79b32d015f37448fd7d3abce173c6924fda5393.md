Police have released a CCTV image of a car they want to trace in connection with a hit-and-run in Ely.

The incident happened at about 1.45am on 20 July as the victim, a man in his 20s, was walking away from Bar62 in Prickwillow Road.

The car, believed to be a white Ford estate, was driven on the wrong side of the road before mounting the kerb.

The victim was taken to hospital with serious facial injuries.

PC Andy Moss said: "I would urge anyone who recognises the vehicle pictured to contact police. We believe the driver's-side door handle was damaged in the collision so the driver may have sought repair work shortly afterwards."

Anyone with information should call police on 101 quoting incident 48 of the 20 July. Alternatively, you can report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report.
