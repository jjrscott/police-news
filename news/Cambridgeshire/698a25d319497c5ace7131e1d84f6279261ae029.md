A 25-year-old woman has been charged with drink driving after being arrested in Peterborough on Friday night (5 June).

Jazmin Beckwith, of Qua Fen Common, Soham, was reportedly involved in two collisions on the A15 in Northborough before being arrested by officers when she blew almost twice the legal limit for alcohol.

She has since been charged with drink driving and has been bailed to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on 9 July.
