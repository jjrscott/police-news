A man has been charged after two shops in Peterborough were victims of theft last week.

Anthony Laird, 38, was arrested in Oundle Road yesterday (22 June) in connection with the theft of alcohol from M&S and aftershave from Boots on 18 June.

Laird, of no fixed address, has since been charged with two counts of theft from a shop and has been remanded in custody to appear at Cambridge Magistrates' Court today (23 June).
