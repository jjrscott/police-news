We are appealing for information after an elderly man was burgled in his home.

The victim, who is in his 70s, was watching television in his lounge in Spring Lane, Bassingbourn at about 2.25am on Sunday (13 May) when two men appeared in front of him.

Holding crowbars they demanded money before searching his home and his trouser pockets.

They left with about Â£300 in cash which they found in a chest of drawers.

One of the men is described as about 6ft, aged between 18 and 22, wearing all black with his face covered with a ski mask.

Detective Constable Hannah Moore said: "We would like to hear from anyone who might've been in the area at the time and saw these men or any vehicles acting suspiciously.

"We would like to reassure the community that we believe this to be an isolated incident, however, we have increased patrols in the area."

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 quoting CF0251370518 or report online.
