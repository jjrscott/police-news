A 25-year-old man has been charged with burglary and is due in court next month.

Kieran Coutts was arrested in the early hours of Monday morning (31 August) in connection with a burglary in Queen's Walk, Fletton, where jewellery and power tools were taken.

Coutts, of Oundle Road, has since been charged with burglary and has been bailed to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on 19 October.
