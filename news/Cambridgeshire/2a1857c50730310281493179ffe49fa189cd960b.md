Five people have been arrested across Cambridgeshire as part of an operation to tackle drugs networking.

Yesterday (Thursday 23 May), officers from Peterborough's Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and Community Action Team (CAT) carried out warrants in Peterborough, Cambridge and Ely, assisted by southern CID.

Two women, aged 31 and 33, both from Peterborough, a 23-year-old man from Cambridge and a 62-year-old man from Ely, were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs and money laundering.

A 39-year-old man from Peterborough was arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs and handling stolen goods. He has since been released under investigation.

The other four have all been bailed to return to Thorpe Wood Police Station on 20 June.
