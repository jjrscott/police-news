We are appealing for witnesses after a 14-year-old boy was hit by a car in Peterborough on Friday (29 November).

The boy was crossing Bishops Road at about 4.20pm when he was struck by a silver Mercedes C220. He suffered serious injuries and was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital, where he remains.

An investigation into the circumstances of the collision is ongoing. No arrests have been made.

Sgt Richard Cruse from the road policing unit said: "The road was busy at the time and we are keen to speak to anybody who saw the collision or those involved leading up to it."

Anyone with information about the collision should call the road policing unit on 101, quoting incident number 362 of 29 November.
