Officers investigating a disorder that took place in Duck Lane, St Neots, yesterday evening (9 April) are appealing for information from the public.

At about 4pm there were around 50 people at the scene upon police arrival, resulting in a disposal notice being issued.

It is believed this was a targeted incident between two parties known to each other.

As a result of the dispersal order, three people were arrested and remain in custody. Officers are now appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time and may have any more information or footage relating to the incident.

There will be increased patrols in the area in the coming days for community reassurance.

Anyone with information regarding this incident should call police on 101 quoting 35/24113/19 or visit www.cambs.police.uk/report. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
