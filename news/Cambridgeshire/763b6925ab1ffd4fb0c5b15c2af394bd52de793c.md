A man who was growing a large amount of cannabis at a property in Longstanton has been jailed for more than two years.

On 4 March police received a call from the ambulance service saying a man had been stabbed in the arm in Magdalene Close. The victim, Elis Nikelkaj, was not willing to reveal what happened or who was involved, but officers discovered a smashed window and noticed a strong smell of cannabis.

They found 84 cannabis plants, later estimated to be worth between £23,000 and £70,000.

Nikelkaj, 36, of Elizabeth Way, in Cambridge, pleaded guilty to being concerned in the production of cannabis at Peterborough Crown Court on Monday (11 December) and was sentenced to two years and three months in jail.

Nobody has been charged with the stabbing that led to the cannabis factory being uncovered.

A second man, Ermir Kryeziu, 31, also admitted being concerned in the production of cannabis at the same hearing and, for a lesser role in the offence, was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for 18 months, and 150 hours' unpaid work.

PC Katie Housham said: "We continue to seek to prosecute those involved in the production and supply of drugs in the county and I hope that this action from the courts serves as a deterrent."
