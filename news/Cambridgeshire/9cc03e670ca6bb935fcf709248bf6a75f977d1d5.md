Members of the public are being warned about a rogue trading scam following an instance in Orton Malborne.

A man in his 80s has been conned out of almost Â£2,000 after fraudsters offered to fix broken fence panelling for him.

Cash was paid to the 'workmen' in instalments, however no work has been carried out.

Members of the public are being urged to report any similar instances to us, but also reminded to stay alert and be cautious of any door-step traders.

Advice can be found on the force website here https://www.cambs.police.uk/A-Z/Doorstep-selling.

To report a crime in action always dial 999. To report a crime after it has happened, or to report suspicious activity, either call 101 or report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report.
