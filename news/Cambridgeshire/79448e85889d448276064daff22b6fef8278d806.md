A man has been taken to hospital in a critical condition after he was assaulted in Peterborough last night.

Officers were called at 9.31pm yesterday (10 January) to reports of violence at The Broadway Theatre on Broadway.

A 45-year-old man was assaulted outside the theatre and suffered serious injuries as a result. He was taken to Peterborough City Hospital in a critical condition, where he remains.

A 42-year-old man from Bourne, Lincolnshire has been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm without intent and remains in custody at Thorpe Wood Police Station.

A cordon was put in place on Broadway while officers investigated, but this has now been lifted.

An investigation has been launched and officers are keen to hear from any witnesses who were in the area at the time.

Anyone with information is urged to call 101 or report online via www.cambs.police.uk/report quoting crime reference number 35/2491/20.
