A man who put hostel residents in danger by setting fire to his room has been sentenced.

Connor Goodliffe, 23, was alone in his room at a seven-bed hostel in London Road, Peterborough, at about 8pm on 31 January.

He called his mother and started making threats that he would set fire to his room if she did not come and collect him.

He then set the corner of a rug alight before leaving the flat and closing the door behind him, walking away along London Road.

Shortly after he left, the fire alarm activated inside the building and other residents attempted to get into Goodlife's flat, believing he was still in there and attempting to rescue him. However, the door was locked and the fire became too intense.

The residents safely evacuated the building and the fire service extinguished the blaze, which left two flats uninhabitable.

Officers located Goodliffe nearby a short while later when he said "I know what I have done, it was just a lighter".

Goodliffe, of London Road, Peterborough, was arrested and later pleaded guilty to arson.

He was sentenced to ten months in prison, suspended for two years, at Peterborough Crown Court yesterday (31 March). Goodliffe was also ordered to pay a Â£149 victim surcharge and handed a 30 day Rehabilitation Activity Requirement.

DC Mat Belfitt said: "Goodliffe's actions were totally unacceptable and put a lot of people in danger.

"It is sheer luck that no one was injured and at no point did Goodliffe alert any of the other occupants to what he had done before leaving.

"The other residents put themselves in danger by attempting to rescue Goodliffe, only to find that he'd abandoned the property.

"I hope Goodliffe reflects on what he did and is deterred from doing anything like this again."
