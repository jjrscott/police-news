A man who stole six bottles of gin from Marks and Spencer has been sentenced.

Thomas Smiley, 30, entered the branch at the Peterborough Motorway Services close to the A1(M) at about 4pm on Saturday (6 June).

He went straight to the alcohol aisle, opened a shopping bag and filled it with six bottles of gin. He then left the shop without paying.

Store staff noticed him leaving, gave chase and managed to catch him at the exit before grabbing the bag.

Unfortunately for Smiley, police were in the area purchasing food and he was arrested at the scene.

Smiley, of Benyon Grove, Orton Malborne, pleaded guilty to theft from a shop at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on Monday (8 June).

He was sentenced to eight weeks in prison, suspended for a year, ordered to complete 100 hours unpaid work and pay Â£230 in costs and compensation.

PC Aidan Mckay said: "We all like a pink gin now and again, but only when you pay for it. Hopefully Smiley will realise the error of his ways and we won't be seeing him again."
