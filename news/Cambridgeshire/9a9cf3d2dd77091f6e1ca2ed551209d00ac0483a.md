A man has been remanded in custody ahead of a trial for crystal meth production in Peterborough.

The 37-year-old was arrested by the Community Action Team on Wednesday last week (14 October) following a warrant in Stanley Road, Eastfield.

He was charged with two counts of being concerned in the production of methylamphetamine, commonly known as 'crystal meth', and appeared at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on Friday (16 October).

He denied the charges and has been remanded in custody for a hearing at Peterborough Crown Court on 13 November.

A 52-year-old man who was arrested alongside Cernek has been bailed to return to Thorpe Wood Police Station on 10 November.

Anyone with information about the supply or production of drugs is urged to report it to police online at https://bit.ly/349fBWq.
