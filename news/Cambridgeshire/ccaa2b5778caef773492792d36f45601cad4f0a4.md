A prolific burglar has been jailed for more than three years.

Andrew Clay, 40, of Walnut Tree Way, Cambridge was found guilty of burglary and sentenced to three years and four months at Peterborough Crown Court yesterday (10 April).

In the early hours of 29 January, Clay broke into a home in Chambers Drive using a set of garden shears and stole keys to the house and garage.

He was disturbed by the occupant who woke up to find smashed glass in her kitchen and called police.

CCTV footage from a nearby property was used to identify Clay.

Detective Chief Inspector Bryan Driver said: "Clay is a habitual criminal and this was his seventh time before the courts for burglary. The streets of Cambridge will be safer with him in prison."

The force launched Operation Aware last month which is tackling burglary by targeting offenders and urging homeowners to take "one more step" to improve their home security.
