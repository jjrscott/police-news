A drink driver has been disqualified for 20 months thanks to a member of public.

The Constabulary's force control room received reports of a lorry driver swerving across the lanes of the eastbound carriageway of the A14 near Milton on Sunday (18 August) afternoon.

Officers were dispatched and caught up with the driver of the Volvo Globetrotter LGV on the A11 towards Thetford.

The driver, 66-year-old Milan Matousek from the Czech Republic blew 75 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - the legal limit being 35 microgrammes.

He was taken to Parkside Police Station in Cambridge where he blew 63 microgrammes.

Matousek was charged with drink driving and appeared at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on Monday (19 August) where he pleaded guilty and was disqualified from driving for 20 months. He was ordered to pay a £600 fine and £145 costs.

PC Ben Suckling who made the arrest said: "Matousek put not only his life but the lives of others at risk by driving over the legal limit. Thanks to a member of the public we were able to remove him from the road before anyone was harmed."
