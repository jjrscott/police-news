A man is due in court today (Wednesday) charged with firearm and drug offences in Peterborough.

Armed officers carried out a warrant in Ellindon, Bretton, at about 4pm on Monday afternoon (22 February) where they discovered a sawn-off shotgun, along with class A drugs.

A 20-year-old man was arrested and has since been charged with possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence, as well as possession with intent to supply heroin and crack cocaine.

He has been remanded to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court today.

A 58-year-old man, a 49-year-old woman and a 15-year-old boy who were also arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm have been bailed to return to Thorpe Wood Police Station on 24 March.
