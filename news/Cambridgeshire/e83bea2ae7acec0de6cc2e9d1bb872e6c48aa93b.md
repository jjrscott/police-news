A man who sent sexually explicit messages to a 13-year-old girl via Facebook messenger has been sentenced.

Aaron Atkin, of Discovery Way, Cambridge, messaged the girl between June and August 2017.

The 26 year old asked the girl what she had done sexually and asked her to send sexual images, Cambridge Magistrates' Court heard.

The messages were reported to police and Atkins was arrested at his home. On his arrest, he claimed he hadn't sent 'anything sexual' to the girl.

However, in police interview he admitted sending sexually explicit questions to the girl and when asked why he had done so he claimed he 'just wanted to know'.

Atkin admitted engaging in sexual communication with a child at Cambridge Magistrates' Court on 12 February.

He was sentenced at Cambridge Crown Court today (28 March) where he was handed a two-year community order.

Atkin was ordered to complete a 60-day rehabilitation activity requirement and 60 hours of unpaid work.

He was also handed a Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO) for a period of five years.

DC Martin Hardy, who investigated, said: "Atkin sent these extremely sexualised messages to a young girl in her early teens.

"The fact that some of the messages referenced meeting the girl in person is particularly sinister.

"Protecting the county's children is one of our priorities and we will continue to work hard every day to keep young people safe."
