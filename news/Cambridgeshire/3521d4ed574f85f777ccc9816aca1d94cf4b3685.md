Police are re-appealing for information following the death of a cyclist in Cambridge last week.

At about 10.30pm on Tuesday, 12 December, Stewart Milne was cycling along Trumpington High Street when he was involved in a collision with a yellow Ford Focus.

Stewart, 44, was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital where sadly he died two nights later (Thursday, 14 December).

PC Sean Redman, from the Beds, Cambs and Herts Road Policing Unit, said: "I am appealing to anyone who witnessed the collision to get in touch with us as a matter of urgency so we can establish the series of events that evening.

"I am specifically appealing for the driver of a dark coloured 'Luton' style box van who was in the area around the time of the incident to get in touch. I believe they may have important information about the movements of the Focus before the collision."

Anyone with information regarding this collision should call police on 101 and ask to speak to a member of the Road Policing Unit quoting CC-12122017-0502. Alternatively visit www.cambs.police.uk/report.
