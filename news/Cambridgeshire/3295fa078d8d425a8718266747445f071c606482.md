A dispersal order has been put in place in Peterborough this weekend in a bid to reduce crime and disorder.

The measure has been taken by the local neighbourhood policing team in response to information about drug-related crime and violent disorder.

The order is in effect from 8am tomorrow (22 August) until 8am on Monday (24 August) and covers the Peterborough areas of Dogsthorpe, New England, and Paston areas marked on the map.

The above areas are encompassed by the A15 Paston Parkway, Welland Road, Eastern Avenue, Western Avenue, Birchtree Avenue, St Pauls Road, Fulbridge Road, A47 alongside Itter Park, Itter Crescent, Paston Ridings, Donaldson Drive, Pratt Avenue and on to Gunthorpe Ridings. Central Park and Stanley Recreation Ground are also included.

Detective Inspector Dave Taylor said: "We're aware of planned drug-related crime and violent disorder in Peterborough this weekend - and the dispersal order gives us the power to make anyone we suspect of being involved to leave the area with immediate effect and not to return within a specified period."

The order has been granted under section 34 of the Anti-Social Behaviour, crime and Policing Act 2014, and allows for Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs) and police officers to direct a person to leave the area specified within the order if they have reasonable grounds to suspect that their behaviour has caused, or is likely to cause, harassment, alarm or distress to members of the public. Failure to comply with the order can result in arrest.
