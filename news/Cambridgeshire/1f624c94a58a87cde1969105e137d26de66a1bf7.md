We have released CCTV images of four men we want to identify in connection with an aggravated burglary in Manea on Saturday afternoon (20 March).

It has been reported that five men attempted to gain access to Witcham Farm Cottage in Purls Bridge Drove at about 3pm.

The 70-year-old occupant was knocked to the ground where he was repeatedly punched and kicked by the group.

His son, who was also at the house, was also assaulted, receiving a deep laceration to his head and required hospital treatment.

The group searched the property and outbuildings before making off in a white Ford Transit van.

It is believed the group were seen at about 2pm in Manea village with the white Transit and another vehicle described as a black 4x4.

Anyone with information on who these men are should contact us via our web chat service or report on the force website and quote 35/16341/21. Anyone without internet access should call 101.
