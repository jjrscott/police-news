Officers investigating a robbery in Elm yesterday afternoon (8 February) are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

At about 4.30pm two men entered the Elm Village Store, in Birches Grove, with their faces covered and threatened staff. They demanded money and cigarettes, before leaving with a quantity of cash.

One of the men is described as roughly 6'1" and the other 5'5".

Detective Constable Marc Bates said: "This was a terrifying experience for the staff at the store; thankfully nobody was hurt.

"I'd appeal to anyone who was in the area at the time or witnessed anything suspicious to contact us as a matter of urgency."
