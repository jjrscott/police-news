We have released CCTV images of two men we would like to speak to in connection with a robbery in Peterborough.

Four men broke into a house in Northfield Road, Millfield at about 10pm on 13 April and took Â£250 cash as well as Asian gold, which is believed to be worth thousands of pounds.

The men threatened the occupants with knives before making off in a white van.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting reference CF0194030418. Alternatively contact Crimestoppers.
