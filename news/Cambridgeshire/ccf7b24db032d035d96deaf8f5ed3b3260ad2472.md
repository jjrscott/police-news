A man has been charged following a collision between Peterborough and Pondersbridge in November last year where a woman died.

The collision, involving a grey Ford Fiesta and a black Range Rover, took place along the B1095, Ramsey Road, Peterborough, at about 2.10am on 12 November.

The driver of the Fiesta, Rachel Radwell, 46, of Crane Avenue, Yaxley, was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital but died as a result of her injuries.
