Police have today (21 September) arrested a suspected drug dealer in Godmanchester.

Inside the home they found suspected drugs, drug paraphernalia and a 17-year-old boy who was arrested on suspicion of possessing a class B drug with intent to supply.

Two air pistols were also confiscated.

A 20-year-old man is helping officers with their inquiries after a small cannabis grow was also found at the property.
