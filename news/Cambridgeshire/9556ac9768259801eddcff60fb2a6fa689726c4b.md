The parents of 17-year-old Bernadette Walker have appeared in court virtually at The Old Bailey this morning (Monday 30 November) in connection with her murder.

Sarah Walker, 37, and Scott Walker, 50, both of Century Square in Millfield, Peterborough, were charged with murder on Monday 14 September.

The charge of murder against Sarah Walker has been dropped, however today she has been charged with two counts of perverting the course of justice.

Scott Walker remains charged with murder as well as the two new counts of perverting the course of justice.

The pair have been further remanded for the next hearing at The Old Bailey on 29 January.

Bernadette was reported missing from Peterborough on 21 July by her parents after she had not been seen for three days.

Police have been carrying out enquiries and searches in an attempt to locate Bernadette, however a 'no-body' murder investigation was launched by the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit on Friday 11 September.

Anyone with information should contact police either by using the online webchat function, or by calling 101 and quoting Operation Penshaw.
