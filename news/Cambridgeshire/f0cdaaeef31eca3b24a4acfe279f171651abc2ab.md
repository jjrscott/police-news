Three people are due to appear in court today (Tuesday 10 November) charged with assaulting a man in Peterborough this weekend.

A 39-year-old man and two women aged 25 and 41 were arrested on Sunday evening in connection with a violent assault on a man in Eastfield Grove at about 4pm the same day.

The victim, a man in his 30s, suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital where he has been receiving treatment.

They have all been charged with causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent. The 41-year-old woman has also been charged with assault causing actual bodily harm (ABH) relating to a separate incident in September.

All three have been remanded in custody to appear at Cambridge Magistrates' Court today.
