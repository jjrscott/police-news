A three-month closure order has been served on a house in Peterborough following ongoing reports of anti-social behaviour (ASB).

The order was issued to 72 Figtree Walk, Dogsthorpe, by the Peterborough Neighbourhood Policing Team this afternoon (Friday 11 September) as a result of numerous reports of ASB.

The successful application was made to Peterborough Magistrates' Court today and the order will be in place for the next three months.

The order states the premises is subject to a closure notice as 'a person has engaged, or is likely to engage in disorderly, offensive or criminal behaviour on the premises, use of the premises is likely to result in serious nuisance to members of the public, that there has been or is likely to be disorder near the premises associated with the use of the premises and the order is necessary to prevent the behaviour, nuisance or disorder from continuing, recurring or occurring'.

Until 11 December the order prohibits any person from entering the premises, other than the landlords and emergency services, under Section 80 of the Anti-Social Behaviour Crime and Policing Act 2014.

Failure to comply with the order is a criminal offence which could result in imprisonment for up to three months, a fine, or both.

You can report anti-social or criminal behaviour online to us via our web-chat.
