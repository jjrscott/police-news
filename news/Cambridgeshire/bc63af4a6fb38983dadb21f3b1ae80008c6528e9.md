A drug dealer has been jailed for 32 months after officers found him with a rucksack full of drugs, with a street value of more than Â£4,000.

 Ronan Davis, 31, caught the attention of officers while acting suspiciously at the Secret Garden Party in July last year.

 When searched, Davis, known to his customers as 'Frank', was found with quantities of LSD, cocaine, MDMA, ketamine, cannabis and cannabis resin, amongst other controlled drugs.

 Davies, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to possession of controlled substances with intent to supply and was sentenced Yesterday (Monday 19 November) at Peterborough Crown Court.

 PC Laura Clark said: "During the investigation messages found on Davies' phone showcased his lifestyle as a frequent drug dealer.

 "This sentence will mean less drugs on the streets of Cambridgeshire."
