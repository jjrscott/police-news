A cannabis factory has been shut down thanks to a member of the public.

Police were called on Friday with concerns of drugs being grown in a property in Kendal Way, Cambridge.

Officers arrived to find around 100 cannabis plants with a value of up to Â£100,000. The factory has now been dismantled and the plants destroyed.

No arrests have been made at this time but investigations are on-going.

PC Andy Shedd, from the Cambridge neighbourhood policing team, said: "With thanks to the information provided by the local community, a substantial amount of illegal drugs have been stopped from finding their way to the streets.

"We would encourage people to continue to look out for signs of illegal cannabis factories including blacked out windows of caravans, disused buildings and warehouses and people coming and going at various time of the day."
