A serial thief who stole baby milk, perfume and face cream has been jailed for 12 weeks.

Kenneth Young, 47, entered Lloyds Pharmacy in the Ortongate Shopping Centre, Peterborough, on 28 October and proceeded to steal four cartons of baby milk.

He returned to the pharmacy on 11 November and this time stole £100 worth of perfume gift sets.

On 13 November he again targeted the same store, picking up almost £100 worth of face cream and attempting to leave without paying.

However, his luck had ran out as an off duty police officer witnessed the incident and detained him before he could escape.

Young, of Herlington, Orton Malborne, was sentenced at Peterborough Crown Court last Thursday (12 December) after pleading guilty to three counts of theft.

PC Lorna Thorley said: "Young clearly thought he could keep taking from the store and get away with it. He didn't count on our proactive officers being around and going above and beyond their duty. I am pleased he is behind bars and off the streets of Peterborough."
