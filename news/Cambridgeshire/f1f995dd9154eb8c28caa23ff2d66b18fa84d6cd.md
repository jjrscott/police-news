A man caught dealing heroin and crack cocaine in Cambridge city has been jailed.

An off duty officer was on his lunch break at the Grafton Centre on 26 October, 2017, when he spotted Peter Abolarin talking to a man and a woman he knew to be drug addicts.

Suspecting a drug deal was about to take place, the officer called for assistance before approaching Abolarin, who ran away.

The 22-year-old of South Street, Enfield, hid a Tic Tac box, with about 20 wraps inside, under the wheel arch of a car before stopping in John Street where he was detained.

Abolarin claimed the drugs were for his personal use but officers found further wraps and cash where he had been staying with his girlfriend in Newmarket Road.

He pleaded guilty to two counts of possession with intent to supply heroin and two counts of possession with intent to supply crack cocaine.

He was sentenced to two years and nine months on Monday (15 July) at Cambridge Crown Court.

Detective Constable Karen Lunn said: "We're working hard to tackle drug dealing in the city and bring people like Abolarin before the courts."

If you suspect someone is involved in drug dealing, report this either online or call 101.
