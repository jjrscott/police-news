A registered sex offender from Peterborough has been charged with breaching a court order while serving a prison sentence.

The 41-year-old was arrested at the gates of HMP Littlehey on Friday morning (9 October) by officers from the northern Public Protection Unit (PPU), a team who monitors sex offenders upon their release into the community.

He has since been charged with two counts of breaching a Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO), namely being in contact with another registered sex offender.

He appeared at Huntingdon Magistrates' Court on Saturday (10 October) where he was remanded in custody for a plea and trial preparation hearing on a date which is yet to be set.
