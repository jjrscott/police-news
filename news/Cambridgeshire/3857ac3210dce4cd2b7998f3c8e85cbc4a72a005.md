A woman has died following a collision involving two vehicles on the M11 on Sunday afternoon (16 December).

Jessica Howe, 22, of Parsonage Downs, Dunmow, Essex, was travelling in a Nissan Micra when it was involved in a collision with a Mercedes C260 at about 1.50pm on the southbound carriageway near Trumpington.

Jessica, a front seat passenger in the vehicle, was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital, but has died.

The driver of the Mercedes and two children travelling in the back were not injured. Both drivers were women.

Anyone who witnessed the collision, or either vehicles in the lead up to it, is asked to contact the road policing unit by calling 101 and quoting incident 241 of 16 December.
