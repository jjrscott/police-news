A man had to undergo two operations on his hand after being attacked by an out-of-control dog in Peterborough.

The dog, a Staffordshire/Dogue de Bordeaux cross, was being walked by Egidijus Gedminas, 37, at about 8pm on 15 January this year when it attacked another dog, a Staffordshire bull terrier.

As the owner of the other dog tried to fend off Gedminas's dog it attacked him, biting his hand, severing a bone and tendon on his index finger.

The victim, 52, was taken to hospital following the attack on a footpath just off Phyill, in Bretton.

Gedminas, of Kirkmeadow, Bretton, was found guilty of owning a dog dangerously out of control and causing injury.

He was sentenced at Peterborough Crown Court to carry out 80 hours unpaid work, ordered to pay £100 in prosecution costs and £2000 compensation to the victim

PC Adrian Anderson, who investigated, said: "This incident could have so easily been avoided had the offender had his dog on a lead.

"Despite there being no previous incidents involving the offender's dog this case goes to show that precautions should always be taken while walking any dog in an area where members of the public or other dogs are likely to be present."
