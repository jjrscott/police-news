Officers are appealing for information following a distraction burglary in Station Road, Soham earlier today (Tuesday 12 June).

At about noon the victim, a man in his 60s, let a man into his home who had claimed he was there to do some gardening.

While the victim showed the man the garden, another man entered the house through the front door and stole the victim's wallet, which contained Â£200.

PC Andy Waters said: "I urge anybody who was in the area at the time and saw anything suspicious to contact us as a matter of urgency."

The first man, who distracted the victim, is described as 5'4", with olive skin, short dark hair and a moustache, and wore a blue hat, white jeans and a t-shirt.

The second man, who stole the wallet, is described as 5'10", white, with dark blond/ginger hair and a beard, and wore a green three-quarter-length coat.

Anyone with information regarding this incident should call police on 101 quoting CC-12062018-0151 or visit www.cambs.police.uk/report. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.

To reduce the risk of becoming the victim of a distraction burglar, always remember:

LOCK - Is your back door locked? If not, lock it before you answer the front door as distraction burglars often work in pairs - one distracts, while the other steals

STOP \- Are you expecting anybody?

CHAIN \- Put this on before you open the door. If you have not got one, it is a worthwhile investment. It will give you that extra 'safe space' and barrier between you and the caller and then,

CHECK \- Ask for their identification card, take it and look at it carefully. Close the door and check the number in the phone book - not the number on the card. If they are genuine they will not mind waiting or coming back another day.
