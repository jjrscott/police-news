A drug dealer who kept crack cocaine and heroin in a pillowcase was spotted acting suspiciously by officers in an unmarked police car.

Isaac Opara, 35, was in a parked Ford Focus in St Bede's Crescent, Cambridge, when officers approached on 18 February last year.

A search of the vehicle and a bag inside it revealed 51 wraps of heroin and crack cocaine. Officers then searched a property linked to Opara in Tweedale, Cambridge, where they found a further 178 wraps of heroin and crack cocaine in a pillowcase.

The 229 wraps of heroin and crack cocaine were estimated to be worth Â£2290.

Opara, of Anstey Way, Cambridge, admitted possession of heroin and crack cocaine with intent to supply.

Yesterday (15 July) at Peterborough Crown Court he was sentenced to two years and seven months in prison.

PC Steve Girdlestone said: "We're working hard to tackle drug dealing in Cambridge.

"These substances wreak havoc on people's lives, trapping them in addiction and causing misery for communities.

"Drug dealing can often be linked to violence, intimidation and other offences, such as burglary, as people desperately try to feed their addiction."
