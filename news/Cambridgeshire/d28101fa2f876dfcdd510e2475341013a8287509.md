POLICE are appealing for witnesses after an attack in Cambridge on Saturday (September 29) left a man needing hospital treatment.

At approximately 5pm a man in his 50s was playing football on St Albans Road recreation ground, near the Meadows Community Centre, when he heard a disturbance.

Minutes later two men entered the football court and attacked him, hitting him to the head several times.

The force of the attack left the victim unconscious. He was taken to hospital and suffered serious, but not life-threatening, injuries as a result of the attack.

The offenders were seen to approach the football court from the St Catherine's estate and make off from the scene in the same direction.

Both men are described as white and in their 20s or 30s.

DS Samuel Constable said: "I know there were many people on the recreation ground at the time of the attack, and therefore I would strongly urge any witnesses to come forward.

"I am also keen to hear from the people who provided first aid to the victim at the scene before the ambulance service arrived."

Anyone with information is asked to call DS Samuel Constable or DS Ashley Ryan on 101 quoting 35/33847/18, or report online at cambs.police.uk/report. Alternatively, you can report anonymously at www.crimestoppers-uk.org/
