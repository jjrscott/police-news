A shoplifter has been jailed and band from Cambridge shopping centres.

Camilla Rumsey, of no fixed abode, was sentenced to 36 weeks in prison at Peterborough Magistrates' Court yesterday (5 May) after pleading guilty to assault, possession of a knife in a public place, possession of a class C drug and theft.

Rumsey hit, bit and spat at a shop worker at Waitrose in Mayor's Walk, Peterborough in February as she attempted to leave with meat and other goods worth more than Â£230.

When she was arrested on 11 March she was found in possession of a Stanley knife and class C controlled drugs.

The 30-year-old was handed a two-year Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) in February preventing her from entering all Boots and TK Maxx stores in Cambridge or entering the Grafton Centre, Grand Arcade or Lion Yard including the associated shops and retail premises within.

PC Jamie Tumber said: "Rumsey is a prolific shoplifter who has targeted stores across the city to fund her drug addiction. We hope the time in prison allows her to get the support she needs while the CBO will provide some respite to the shops affected by her behaviour. I would encourage any business to report any breaches to us."
