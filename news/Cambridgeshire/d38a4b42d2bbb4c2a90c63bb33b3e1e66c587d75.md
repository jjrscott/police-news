Police are urging members of the public to get in contact if they have been the victims of fraud, or attempted fraud, in Peterborough.

We received a report yesterday (23 April) that two men have been targeting an elderly resident in the Dogsthorpe area.

They visited regularly over the past few months claiming to be police officers.

Each time the victim asked for proof of identification, the fraudsters claimed to have 'forgotten their ID'.

DS Shish Thind said: "The victim correctly refused the men entry and we would like to take this opportunity to clarify that police officers will always carry identification and will always clearly show it to you on request.

"These men are trying to use the police as a way in to vulnerable people's homes, likely to steal belongings while they are distracted. I am urging anyone who has been a victim of this crime, or thinks they have been targeted by them, to get in contact with us.

"Even if you refused them entry the information could be invaluable to our investigation."

Anyone with information should call police on 101 quoting incident 154 of 23 April or report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report.

If you are not expecting anyone to visit you do not let them into your home and if you're really unsure, don't open the door. You can read more advice here https://www.cambs.police.uk/A-Z/Bogus-callers
