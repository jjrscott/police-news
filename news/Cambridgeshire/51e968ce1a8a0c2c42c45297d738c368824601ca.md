TOMORROW (Friday) officers in Cambridge will be taking to Twitter to give members of the public an insight into what an average day looks like for police in the city.

Last month (August) a total of 2,731 calls for service were made in Cambridge and a total of 1,160 crimes were recorded in the city.

Inspector Nick Skipworth said: "We are taking to Twitter to highlight the demand on us and why we have to prioritise calls for service.

"As with all allocation of police resource we have to take into account ongoing incidents as well as force priorities such as domestic abuse, sexual assault and child protection, therefore all police response will be based on the highest levels of threat, risk and harm."

To follow the activity tomorrow look out for @CambridgeCops on Twitter.
