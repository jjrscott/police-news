A registered sex offender from Peterborough has been jailed after he breached a court order by deleting the dating apps Grindr and Tinder.

Matthew Verity, 42, was handed a Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO) and placed on the Sex Offenders Register in 2016 after being convicted of sexual assault.

Verity was visited at his home address in Wesleyan Road, Dogsthorpe on 12 July by officers from the north-based Public Protection Unit (PPU) as part of a routine check on registered sex offenders living within Cambridgeshire.

One of the restrictions as part of his SHPO is he must not delete any internet history. On inspection of his phone officers found evidence Verity had deleted WhatsApp messages and the two dating apps.

Yesterday (3 April) at Peterborough Crown Court he was jailed for eight months, having pleaded guilty to breaching his SHPO at a previous hearing.

Detective Sergeant Paul Stimpson, from the Public Protection Unit, said: "From the point of his conviction Verity was allocated a member of my team to monitor him, meaning they pay him regular unannounced visits, check he is not breaching any of his conditions and monitor his electronic devices.

"These measures are in place to ensure public safety and the team are very thorough with their inspections, hence the discovery of Verity's breaches."
