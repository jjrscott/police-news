A man is due in court today following a knife-point robbery in Peterborough earlier this week.

The 23-year-old was arrested on Monday evening (1 March) following reports of a knife-point robbery where the victim had his car stolen in Bader Close, Westwood, earlier the same day.

He has since been charged with robbery, possession of a knife in a public place, drink driving, driving while disqualified, driving without insurance, criminal damage and theft from a shop.

He has been remanded in custody to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court today (Wednesday).

Anyone with information about someone who carries a knife is urged to report it to us online.
