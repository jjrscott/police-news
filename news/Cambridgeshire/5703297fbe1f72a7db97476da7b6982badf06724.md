Drugs and cash have been seized following two warrants in Longstanton this morning.

Officers from the South Cambs Neighbourhood Policing Team visited properties in Stevensons Road and Prentice Close under the Misuse of Drugs Act.

In Prentice Close officers found items believed to be linked to the supply of illegal drugs including cash, class A drugs and other drug paraphernalia.

At the Stevensons Road location officers found drugs and other drug paraphernalia.

A 17-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply drugs and remains in custody at Parkside Police Station.

PC Chris Smith from the team said: "We use information submitted by members of the public as well as our own intelligence to carry out drugs warrants.

"The public are often our eyes and ears and it's vital they continue to report information and concerns to us."

Anyone who suspects illegal drug activity in their area should get in touch online or by calling 101.
