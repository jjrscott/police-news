We are appealing for the public's help in identifying a man we would like to speak to in connection with a distraction burglary in Milton.

At about 9.30am on 26 February the elderly victim let a man, who claimed he was from the water board, into her home in Coles Road.

He stole the 83-year-old's purse and used bank cards later that day to purchase goods worth more than Â£140 at several convenience stores across Milton.

Anyone who recognises the man pictured or has any information regarding the incident should call 101 quoting 35/13896/19.
