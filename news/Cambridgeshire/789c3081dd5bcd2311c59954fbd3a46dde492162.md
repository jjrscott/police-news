A man has been sentenced after he was caught with a knife in Cambridge twice in less than three weeks.

Alex Vasekin, 20, was standing outside Addenbrooke's Hospital on 7 November having a cigarette when security told him to put it out.

He refused to stop smoking so security started to escort him off the property when he told them he had a knife.

He was detained and searched by security who phoned police after finding a knife in his jacket pocket. He was arrested and had the blade seized, but was subsequently released under investigation.

In the early hours of Monday (26 November) he was seen at Lola Lo nightclub in Cambridge, repeatedly lifting his t-shirt up to show a knife hidden in the waistband of his trousers.

Security approached him and told him to hand over the weapon, which he did, before calling the police.

Vasekin, of Bowers Croft, Cambridge, was sentenced to two months in prison, suspended for a year, at Cambridge Magistrates' Court last Wednesday (28 November) after pleading guilty to two counts of possession of a knife in a public place

PC Hayley Mitchell said: "Regardless of whether Vasekin intended to use the weapon, he broke the law and showed no concern for the safety of the public.

"Tackling serious street-based violence is a force priority and we will continue to do all we can to take as many offensive weapons off the streets of Cambridgeshire as possible."

The maximum penalty for an adult carrying a knife or other offensive weapons in public is four years in prison and a fine of Â£5,000.
