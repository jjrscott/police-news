Police have released an image of a watch they suspect to have been stolen and are looking to reunite it with its owner.

The watch was recovered following an arrest in Peterborough last night; a 37-year-old man is currently in custody on suspicion of burglary.

Anyone who believes the watch is theirs and can prove ownership should call 101 and ask to speak with DC Tom Hunt.
