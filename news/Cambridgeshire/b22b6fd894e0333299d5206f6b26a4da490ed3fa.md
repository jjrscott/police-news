A man who attempted to burgle a Longstowe home has been jailed.

Neil Blake, 49, from St Albans had been drinking when he smashed the glass on the front and rear doors of the property in High Street at about 8.40pm on 19 August.

The victim was inside the house and called police as he broke into a Volkswagen Caddie and stole the keys to a flatbed van.

He then headed to Rushbrook Close where he spotted an unoccupied blue Mini with shopping inside. Blake started eating the food and took the clothes before police arrived and arrested him.

Blake was found with a large cut on his arm from breaking the window of the house. He was also in possession of keys to the van and a bottle of aftershave.

At Cambridge Crown Court on Wednesday (9th) he pleaded guilty to attempted burglary and three counts of theft. He was sentenced to 21 months imprisonment.

DC Ciaron Hickey said: "Blake told us he had been drinking sherry and wasn't in control of his actions but this is no excuse as the sentence demonstrates.

"The victim in this case was extremely shaken but did the right thing calling us straight away so we could apprehend him and stop further offending."
