A mother who sought revenge for her daughter by bottling a woman at a Peterborough nightclub has been jailed.

Pharramena Barsby, 37, was in Red Room, Broadway, on 20 August last year when her daughter was involved in an argument with her boyfriend's ex-partner.

At about 2.30am Barsby approached a group the woman was with and confronted them. She then grabbed another woman's hair, dragged her to the floor and repeatedly hit her with a bottle.

The victim, a woman in her 20s, was cut to the left side of her head and received hospital treatment.

Barsby admitted assault causing actual bodily harm.

On Friday (12 October) at Peterborough Crown Court she was sentenced to 36 weeks in prison and ordered to pay a Â£140 victim surcharge.

Detective Constable Paul Twell said: "Instead of ignoring the initial argument, Barsby decided to take revenge by conducting this vicious attack. The victim was fortunate her injuries were not more severe."
