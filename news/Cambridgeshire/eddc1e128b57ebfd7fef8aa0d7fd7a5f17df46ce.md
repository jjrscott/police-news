A woman assaulted a police officer after he intervened at a gathering during the height of coronavirus restrictions.

Inga Puodziuniene, 42, was at the gathering in Deene Court, Peterborough, on 16 April.

Police attended after reports it had got out of hand. They tried to speak to Puodziuniene, but she was intoxicated and became obstructive.

As officers attempted to calm her down she became even more agitated and punched one of them to the face.

She was arrested at the scene and pleaded guilty to assaulting an emergency worker at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on Monday (15 June).

Puodziuniene, of Barnstock, Bretton, was ordered to pay £200 compensation to the officer and £700 in court fees.

PC Sanchez Thomas said: "This was an attack against a police officer who was simply doing his job.

"Thankfully the officer did not suffer serious injuries, but this type of behaviour is completely unacceptable."
