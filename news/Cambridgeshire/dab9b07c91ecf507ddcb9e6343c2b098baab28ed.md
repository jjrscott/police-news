A man who brandished a machete in the centre of Cambridge has been sentenced.

Wayne Trickett, 30, of Willow Walk, pulled out the weapon in Rose Crescent at about 9.30pm on 28 February last year (2020).

Concerned for their safety, a member of the public called police and Trickett was arrested a short while later by the Armed Policing Unit in nearby Drummer Street.

Officers found the machete inside his jacket.

At Cambridge Magistrates' Court on Thursday (25 February), after pleading guilty to possession of a knife in public, Trickett was given a six month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months.

The court also imposed a two-month curfew meaning Trickett must wear an electronic tag and is not allowed to leave his home in Willow Walk between the hours of 8pm and 8am.

PC Rich Jenkins said: "Carrying any form or weapon is unacceptable and actually puts you at more risk of being seriously harmed."

If you know someone who carries a knife or a weapon, you can report it to police.
