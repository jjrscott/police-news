A man who was found trying to smuggle cannabis, a knife and mobiles phones into HMP Peterborough has been jailed.

Prison officer Ibrahim Hussain, 20, of Burmer Road, Peterborough, was caught in a random search on 26 October last year.

 He initially tried to avoid the search but when it was carried out a large wrapped package was found in his uniform.

Inside was 74 grams of cannabis, worth about Â£3500, a twin blade lock knife and three mobile phones with charging leads.

Today (8 November) he was jailed for three years and four months at Peterborough Crown Court after pleading guilty to three counts of conveying a prohibited item into a prison.

DC Harv Hutton said: "Taking prohibited items into a prison is a serious offence and I hope this sentence acts as a deterrent to anyone else considering committing the same crime."
