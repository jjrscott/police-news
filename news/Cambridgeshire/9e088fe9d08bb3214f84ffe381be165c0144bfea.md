Detectives are appealing for witnesses following an armed robbery in Peterborough.

The men made off on foot along Oundle Road away from the city centre. They then cut across a car park towards Orchard Street. The got away with approximately Â£150.

Detective Constable Fran Scott said: "Thankfully the member of staff was not harmed but that doesn't take away from the severity of the incident.
