We are appealing for information after Whittlesey Gun Shop was broken into last night (Thursday 3 December).

It is believed a group of four men cut through gates to the premises in Station Road at about 9pm to then force entry to the shop.

They were in the store for about 20 minutes before leaving with items including clothing, lamps and air rifles.

Anyone with information about the incident, or who may have seen suspicious activity in the area at the time, is urged to contact us online either at www.cambs.police.uk/report, or using the online web chat function and quoting incident 413 of 3 December. Those who do not have access to the internet should call 101.
