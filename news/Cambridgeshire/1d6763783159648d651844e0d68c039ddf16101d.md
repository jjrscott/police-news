A man who grabbed his partner by the hair and threatened to kill her has been jailed for two months.

Constantin Ion, 48, shouted, "what are you doing there? I am going to kill you tonight", at the home they shared in Bamber Street, Peterborough, on 27 May.

She told police that he pulled her by the hair and raised a knife above his head before slapping her and shouting, "I want to break your arms and legs, I want to destroy you."

In desperation, the victim escaped through a window and reported the incident to police. She suffered bruising to her chin and shoulder.

Ion, of Bamber Street, Peterborough, pleaded guilty to common assault and making threats to kill. He was sentenced to two months in prison on Friday (19 July) at Peterborough Crown Court for common assault, while the threats to kill charge was ordered to lie on file.

DC Andrew Bond, who investigated, said: "Ion's violent outburst towards his partner was completely out of control and unwarranted. It left her fearful and shaken after having to flee her home.

"I am glad that justice has been done and Ion will serve time for what he did."
