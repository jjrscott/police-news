Police in Cambridge have uncovered a cannabis factory in an industrial estate.

Officers raided a unit in Fen Road, Milton, yesterday afternoon (12 May) and found 51 cannabis plants, with a street value of up to Â£42,000.

Two men, aged 37 and 42, were arrested at the property on suspicion of producing cannabis and remain in custody.

Detective Inspector Dave Savill: "Drugs can have a devastating impact on people's lives and often go hand in hand with other types of criminality.

"I would encourage those who have suspicions of illegal activity to report them to us, no matter how insignificant it may seem. People coming and going around the clock and blacked out windows are just a couple of things to look out for."

Information about illegal drug activity can be reported via www.cambs.police.uk/report or by calling 101.
