A Cambridge drug dealer has been jailed for four years after police caught him with hundreds of pounds of crack cocaine.

Tafadzwa Munyawiri, 21, of Hatherdene Close, Cambridge, was sentenced at Cambridge Crown Court on Monday (31 July). He pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply class A drugs and possession of class B drugs.

Officers searched Munyawiri in April in Blossom Street while out on patrol.

He attempted to run but was detained following a struggle.

Munyawiri was found in possession of 7.7 grams of crack cocaine worth around £770, enough for 77 individual deals, and 0.2 grams of cannabis. He was also found with two phones, one containing drug dealing texts, and more than £216 in cash.

Sergeant Paul Street said: "We have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to drugs and our priority is to remove dealers like Munyawiri from the streets of Cambridge.

"Munyawiri's sentence clearly demonstrates how seriously the courts take drug related offences."
