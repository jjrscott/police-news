Members of the public are being urged to secure their vehicles following 41 reports of vehicle crime since the start of the month.

The majority of these have been in the Westwood and Ravensthorpe areas where insecure vehicles have been targeted and valuables left on display taken. These include items ranging from loose change to sunglasses.

DS Andy Harding said: "It is really important that all vehicles are locked and nothing of value is left in them.

"If you are lucky enough to have a driveway please do invest in a driveway alarm. Thieves will take anything they can get their hands on, including low value items, so even if something may not seem of much value to you, please keep it out of sight or ideally not left in unattended vehicles.

"If you are not using your vehicle regularly because of the lockdown then please help us reduce the risk by keeping items out of sight and double checking your vehicle is locked before leaving it."

We advise you;

 * Ensure all doors, windows and sunroofs are closed and locked when leaving your vehicle
 * Never leave valuables in your vehicle and keep any other possessions out of sight. Remove your satnav and its holder and wipe away any window suction marks as these could indicate a satnav is stored in your vehicle
 * Never leave vehicle documents in your car, as this would make it easy for a thief to sell your car or provide a cover story if stopped by the police
 * Use an approved steering lock or gear clamp and remember to set the immobiliser or alarm on your vehicle, if it has them
