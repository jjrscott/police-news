A woman who set light to her home following an argument with her partner has been jailed.

Katrina Browne, 41, of Belsars Close, Willingham pleaded guilty to arson and was handed a 20 month sentence, suspended for two years at Cambridge Crown Court today (15 March).

The court heard how neighbours alerted police and the fire service to a fire at the home in the early hours of 23 December last year.

An investigation by the fire service revealed that a mattress in a bedroom on the first floor had been deliberately set light to.

Browne told officers she had been arguing with her partner and he had barricaded himself into a bedroom. She said she had been drinking and remembered lighting the lighter but not setting fire to anything.

PC Katie Housham said: "Both Browne and her partner were lucky not to have been seriously injured as a result of this fire."
