We are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an aggravated burglary in Wisbech St Mary yesterday evening (Monday).

The victim, who is in her 50s, was at her home in Churchfield Way at about 5.30pm when she heard a loud noise coming from the back of her home.

She found two men in her kitchen, both were dressed all in black and wearing balaclavas, one of them holding a metal bar.

The pair had smashed glass doors to gain entry to the home and fled through the same point after seeing the victim.

Anyone with information is urged to report information to us online or through our online webchat function and quote crime reference 35/13614/21. Those without access to the internet should call 101.
