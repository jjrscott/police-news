Three men have been charged in connection with an investigation into the supply of cocaine in Peterborough.

Officers from the northern Community Action Team (CAT) arrested a 27-year-old man in Paston Ridings yesterday afternoon (Thursday 11 June) on suspicion of conspiracy to supply class A drugs.

His brother, a 25-year-old man, was arrested shortly after in Tennyson Road in connection with the same offence, along with a 25-year-old woman.

A 49-year-old man, was arrested later on in Park Road, again on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs.

All three men have been charged with conspiracy to supply cocaine and have been remanded in custody to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court today (Friday 12 June).

The 25-year-old woman has been released under investigation.
