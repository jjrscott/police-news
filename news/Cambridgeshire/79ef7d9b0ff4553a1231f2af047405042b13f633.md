Police have released CCTV images of two men they want to speak to in connection with a burglary in Peterborough city centre.

A flat in Riverview House, Viersen Platz, was broken into between 12.30am and 8am on 12 January, with offenders stealing the victim's rucksack containing his wallet.

It is believed one of his bank cards was then used at a shop in Lincoln Road the same day.

DC Tessa Munro said: "We urge members of the public to look at these images and contact police if they recognise the men or have any information."

Anyone with any information should call police on 101 and ask to speak with DC Tessa Munro.
