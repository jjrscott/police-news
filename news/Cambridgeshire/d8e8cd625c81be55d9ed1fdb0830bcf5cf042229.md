A huntsman who was in charge of a pack of hounds that killed a fox near Elton has been fined.

George Adams, 66, was in charge of the hounds as part of the Fitzwilliam Hunt, which began at about 11am on 1 January 2016 in Wansford. As well as the hounds, a falconer was present with a golden eagle.

Peterborough Magistrates' Court heard that to remain within the law, birds of prey are sometimes used to kill foxes that are flushed out by a pack of dogs during a hunt.

However, when the hounds picked up the scent of the fox on this occasion the bird was not released and it was killed by the pack instead.

Adams pleaded not guilty to hunting a wild mammal with dogs. However, yesterday (4 April) he was convicted following a two-day trial. He was fined £1,000 and ordered to pay £950 costs.

The falconer, a man in his 40s, was found not guilty of hunting a wild mammal with a dog and causing unnecessary suffering to an animal.

A spokesperson for Cambridgeshire Constabulary said: "We take breaches of the Hunting Act very seriously and we will do all we can to bring people to justice who do not comply with the law."
