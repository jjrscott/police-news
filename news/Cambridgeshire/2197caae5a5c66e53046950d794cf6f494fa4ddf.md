A man is due in court today (Tuesday 13 October) charged with burgling two houses in Peterborough last year.

The 33-year-old was initially arrested in May this year in connection with burglaries in Werrington and Dogsthorpe in November 2019.

Yesterday (Monday 12 October) he was charged with two counts of burglary including theft, as well as causing more than Â£2,000 worth of damage to a police vehicle, failing to stop when directed to do so by police, driving without insurance, failing to report an accident to police and driving without consideration for other road users.

All vehicle/driving offences relate to an incident in Peterborough on 29 August this year.

He has been remanded in custody to appear at Cambridge Magistrates' Court today.
