A Cambridge woman who would order restaurant meals without the means to pay for them has been handed a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO).

Anna Mcewan, 50, of Garden Walk, was given the two-year CBO at Cambridge Magistrates' Court for her anti-social behaviour on Thursday (25 February).

The CBO states she must not:

 * Enter any restaurant within the boundaries of the A14, A11 and M11 without sufficient means to pay for goods and without the requisite intention to pay for said goods
 * Act in an anti-social or disorderly manner, that is to say a manner that causes or is likely to cause nuisance, disruption, harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons of the same household within the boundaries of the A14, A11 and M11.
 * Act in an anti-social or disorderly manner, that is to say a manner that causes or is likely to cause nuisance, disruption, harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons of the same household within Michaelmas Place and Garden Walk

PC Beatrice Ley from the Cambridge City South neighbourhood policing team said: "Mcewan would repeatedly go into restaurants in the city and order food without the means to pay for them. She would then become verbally aggressive towards staff and police. We hope this CBO will provide some respite to businesses in the city while Mcewan gets the support she needs to stop offending.

"Anyone who sees Mcewan breaching her CBO should report it to police who will deal with it robustly."

Mcewan also pleaded guilty to using threatening behaviour and was sentenced to eight weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months after claiming she had a knife and made threats to kill two security guards, a bus driver, a member of the public and two police officers in the city on 16 January.
