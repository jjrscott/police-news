Two men who provided fake Italian documents to police have been jailed.

Officers from the Special Constabulary were on patrol in response to drug dealing concerns in Davy Road, Cambridge on 17 September when they came across Melvin Goleci and Lorenc Fisniku parked up in a vehicle.

The pair were arrested after two jars of cannabis and a knuckleduster were found in their vehicle.

At the station officers discovered, with the help of Immigration, that their Italian driving licences used to verify their identity were fake and had also been used to insure the vehicle.

At Peterborough Crown Court on Friday (16 October), Goleci, 25, of Coldhams Lane, Cambridge was sentenced to eight months in prison after pleading guilty to possession of identity documents with intent and possession of an offensive weapon. He was also disqualified from driving for 18 months.

Fisniku, 28, of no fixed abode, was sentenced to seven months in prison after pleading guilty to possession of identity documents with intent.
