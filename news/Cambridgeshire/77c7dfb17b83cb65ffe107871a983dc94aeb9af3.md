Proactive patrols in Peterborough have resulted in a 21-year-old man and a 17-year-old boy being arrested on suspicion of drugs offences.

Yesterday evening (6 November) two officers were on a plain clothed foot patrol when they spotted what they thought could be a drug deal taking place from a car.

The car drove off, but the officers were able to get the number plate.

With some quick research using ANPR systems they were able to pin point where the vehicle had travelled and, with the help of colleagues, managed to stop it in Whittlesey Road, Stanground.

The two occupants were both arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs and possession of a weapon.

The 21-year-old has since been further arrested for driving without a license or insurance.

They remain in custody at Thorpe Wood Police Station.
