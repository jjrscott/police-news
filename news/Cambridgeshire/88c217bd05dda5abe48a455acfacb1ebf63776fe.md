A Cambridge home has been issued with a closure order following police action.

The order was issued to 3 Francis Darwin Court on Thursday (2 July) after a successful application from police to Cambridge Magistrates' Court.

The action came as a result of frequent reports of anti-social behaviour, drug use and criminal activity

A closure order was granted and the property will be closed for three months.

PC Eleanor Bacchus from the City North Neighbourhood Team said: "Over a prolonged period of time, there have been persistent reports and information relating to people visiting this address including drug use, dealing, noise and intimidating behaviour.

"We hope that preventing visitors will significantly reduce the impact on the local residents and allow them and their families to be in their homes and use the communal gardens without feeling intimidated."

The closure order states the house be closed in accordance with the Anti-Social Behaviour Crime and Policing Act 2014 and only permits access to the tenant and emergency services until 2 October. If anyone is found on the premises unlawfully they render themselves liable to arrest.
