We have released CCTV of a man we would like to speak to after shop workers in Peterborough were threatened and racially abused.

At about 10.15am on Tuesday, 14 August, a man was asked to leave Morrisons in Lincoln Road after he was caught shoplifting. He returned shortly after, shouting abuse and threatening staff with a wooden pole.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time or who might recognise the man pictured.

Anyone with information should call police on 101 quoting 35/22611/18 or visit www.cambs.police.uk/report. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.

Do you recognise this man?
