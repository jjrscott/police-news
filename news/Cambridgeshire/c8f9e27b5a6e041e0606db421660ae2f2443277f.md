Police are investigating a burglary in which four men with their faces covered, broke into a home, threatened a boy with a screwdriver and made off with a haul worth thousands of pounds.

The house in St Georges Street, Wittering, near Peterborough, was targeted between 6pm and 7pm on Thursday (12 December).

The intruders got in through the front door which was unlocked, threatened the boy with a screwdriver and asked where money was kept. They then took him upstairs while they ransacked the property.

Jewellery worth about £3500 was stolen, along with £1000 in cash, iPhones and iPads.

The burglars made off and police were called.

Detective Sergeant Shishminder Thind, who is investigating, said "We believe this burglary was targeted and is most likely part of a series"

"We are following all investigative leads and are keen to catch the offenders"

"If you were in the area and saw anything suspicious or live nearby and have CCTV or dash cam footage, please contact police."
