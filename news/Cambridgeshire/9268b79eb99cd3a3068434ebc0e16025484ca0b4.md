**Now believed to be in High Wycombe, Thames Valley**

We are appealing for information in relation to a teenage girl who has gone missing from her home in Peterborough.

Isma Kouser, 17, has not been seen since leaving her home in West Town on 10 October.

She is described as Asian, 5' 2" tall, slim build with brown eyes and very long black hair. She was last seen wearing a long yellow top, black trousers and was carrying a large brown/tan handbag.

Missing: 17-year-old Isma Kouser

Detective Inspector Dan Pawson said: "There was a reported sighting of Isma near Peterborough Regional College on the day she went missing, however we believed she may have then travelled to the Huddersfield area of West Yorkshire. We have since had information which suggests she is now in the Thames Valley area, specifically High Wycombe.

"A considerable amount of time has now passed since we know Isma was last seen by her family and we are growing increasingly concerned that she may have come to some harm."

If anyone has seen Isma, or believes they may know where she is, please contact us by calling 101.
