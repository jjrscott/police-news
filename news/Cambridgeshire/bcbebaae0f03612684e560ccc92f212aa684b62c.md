We would like to speak to this man in connection with a burglary in Peterborough last month.

In the early hours of Tuesday, 4 December, two laptops worth more than Â£1000 were stolen from the Key Theatre at the Embankment.

Officers are keen to identify the man and urge anyone who may know who he is to pass on information by reporting online at www.cambs.police.uk/report and quote 35/49987/18, or you can call 101.

Do you recognise this man?
