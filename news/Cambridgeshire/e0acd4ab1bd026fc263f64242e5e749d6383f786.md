Two men have been charged with conspiracy to distribute class A drugs as part of an investigation into drug supply networks in Hertfordshire.

Justin Terry, aged 45 and of no fixed abode, was arrested in Elstree and Martin Walsh, aged 53, of Churchfield Road in Watford, was arrested in Liverpool. Both were subsequently charged with conspiracy to supply class A and class B drugs (cocaine and amphetamine). Both were also charged with possession of cocaine with intent to supply (independently of one another). Walsh was also charged with possession of criminal property (cash). During the operation 3.5 kilos of suspected cocaine and Â£37,000 in cash were seized. Both men have been remanded into custody.

The investigation was carried out as part of Operation Relentless, Hertfordshire Constabulary's response to the on-going threat from organised criminal gangs.

Suspected drugs use can be reported via the police non-emergency number 101. If a crime is in progress, always dial 999. You can also use the Constabulary's online reporting form at herts.police.uk/report.
