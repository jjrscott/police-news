We have imposed a section 60 order in Peterborough for the next 24 hours in response to instances of arson which are being linked.

The order, which has been authorised by an inspector, gives us more powers to search people and vehicles under Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.

It has been put in place following six instances of arson attacks on vehicles and properties in the Eastfield, New England and Millfield areas in the last four days, since Saturday 29 February.

DI Dave Taylor said: "At this early stage in our investigation we believe these to be targeted attacks and do not believe there to be any risk to the general public, however we have taken measures in order to prevent further instances from happening.

"The order will be in place between 8pm this evening (Tuesday) and 8pm tomorrow (Wednesday) and will give officers the power to stop any pedestrian or vehicle in the specified area, and search them for offensive weapons or dangerous instruments."

The order covers the area encompassed by the A47 Soke Parkway from its junctions with the A15 Paston Parkway and Bourges Boulevard, down Bourges Boulevard to the River Nene, along to the A1139 Frank Perkins Parkway and back up to the A15 Paston Parkway.

Anyone with information about the incidents is urged to report to us either online at www.cambs.police.uk/report or call 101. Alternatively contact the independent charity, Crimestoppers, anonymously online at www.crimestoppers-uk.org or call 0800 555 111.
