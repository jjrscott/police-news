A man charged with class A drug offences has been remanded in prison for trial at crown court after denying the offences.

The 36-year-old, of no fixed address, was arrested in Saville Road park on Tuesday evening (21 July) after reports from a member of the public about a suspected drug deal.

He was charged with two counts of possession with intent to supply class A drugs, both heroin and crack cocaine, and was remanded to appear at Cambridge Magistrates' Court on Thursday (23 July).

He pleaded not guilty to the offences and has been remanded in prison for trial at Peterborough Crown Court on 20 August.
