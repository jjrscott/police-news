Police are appealing for information following an attempted knife point robbery on Rhubarb Bridge over the A47 in Peterborough on Tuesday night (9 June).

At about 8.30pm a man riding a black bicycle swerved into the path of a woman before brandishing a knife and threatening her.

He is described as white, in his late 20s, tall, slim, with a distinctive pointed nose and mousy brown hair with a fringe. He was wearing a grey tracksuit, grey hooded top and a black backpack.

He spoke in an Eastern European accent before cycling off empty handed in the direction of the Brotherhood retail park after she called out for help.
