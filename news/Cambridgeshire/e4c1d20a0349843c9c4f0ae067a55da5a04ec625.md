A disqualified driver led police on a pursuit and drove dangerously on residential roads in an attempt to evade arrest.

Andrew Turiccki, 27, was spotted driving a Citroen C3 in Cecil Road, Peterborough, on 20 March last year when officers requested he pull over.

Turiccki accelerated and a pursuit began. He drove erratically, at times in the path of oncoming traffic, and overtook other vehicles at speeds of more than 50mph on residential roads.

After about a mile he stopped in Lavender Cresent, Dogsthorpe, and was arrested.

He later admitted dangerous driving.

Yesterday (22 March) at Peterborough Crown Court, Turiccki, of Century Square, Peterborough, was jailed for a year and ten weeks. He was also disqualified from driving for four years, with a 31-week extension.

Charges of driving whilst disqualified and driving without insurance were ordered to lie on file.

PC Andy Holliday said: "The way Turiccki drove was completely irresponsible and it was only luck that he wasn't involved in a collision and nobody was injured. I'm pleased he was arrested before a collision took place and he has now been jailed."
