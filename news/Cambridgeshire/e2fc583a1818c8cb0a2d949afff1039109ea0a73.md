Jamie Marshall-Macintosh, 23, of no fixed abode was given the Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) after pleading guilty to four counts of theft of a pedal cycle, theft from a shop and receiving stolen goods.

The 23-year-old stole four bikes from Cycle Point at Cambridge Railway Station between September and November last year (2019).

On 3 June he hid in a corner of B&M in Coldhams Lane, Cambridge while consuming food and drink from the shelves and smoking a cigarette.

He also attempted to sell a bike he knew to be stolen.

At Cambridge Magistrates' Court on Thursday (25 June) he was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison, suspended for two years.

The two-year CBO prevents him from entering the Cycle Point at Cambridge Railway Station under any circumstances. He must not be in possession of any pedal cycle unless he has with him proof of purchase or proof of his ownership of the cycle.

Sergeant Kiri Mazur from the city south neighbourhood policing team said: "Marshall-Macintosh is a prolific thief with a number of thefts against his name. The suspended sentence means that any further offences committed by him could activate his sentence and put him in prison.

"Any breaches of the CBO will be dealt with robustly."

Cycle crime prevention advice.
