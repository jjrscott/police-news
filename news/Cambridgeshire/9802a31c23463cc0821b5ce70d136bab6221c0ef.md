A man who was chased by two members of public on bicycles after committing a cashpoint robbery has been jailed.

Craig Teat, 39, approached the victim on 1 May as he was withdrawing Â£50 from a cash machine in Sidney Street, Cambridge. Teat claimed to have a knife and threatened the victim, a man in his 30s, before snatching the money. A struggle took place, but Teat managed to run away.

The victim started to chase Teat, along with a woman who witnessed the incident, before they were joined in the pursuit by two men on bicycles.

The chase continued along Trinity Street, down St Mary's Street and across Market Square where Teat managed to escape.

Teat was identified following detailed descriptions given by the witnesses and arrested the following day.

On Friday (1 June) at Cambridge Crown Court Teat, of Chesterton Road, pleaded guilty to robbery and was sentenced to two years in prison.
