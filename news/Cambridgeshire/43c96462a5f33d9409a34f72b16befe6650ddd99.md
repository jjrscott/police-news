A man who targeted a business park to steal bikes has been jailed.

Derek Lundgreen, of Hills Road, Cambridge was sentenced to 28 weeks in prison after pleading guilty to two counts of bike theft, attempted bike theft and possession of cannabis at Cambridge Magistrates' Court on Friday (4 September).

The 55-year-old was caught on CCTV stealing a bike worth £100 and attempting to steal another on 15 August from a unit at Cambridge Science Park in Milton Road.

He returned on 24 August and stole another bike worth £1,500.

When he was arrested on 2 September he was found in possession of cannabis.

Lundgreen has also been given a three-year Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) not to:

 * Enter Tesco, Co-Op or Boots stores in the county of Cambridgeshire
 * Enter any of the three indoor shopping areas in Cambridgeshire (The Grafton Centre, Grand Arcade or Lion Yard) including the shops and retail premises within
 * Not to enter Frontier Development PLC Unit in Cambridge Science Park under any circumstances

PC Jamie Tumber from the Cambridge city neighbourhood policing team said: "Lundgreen is a prolific Cambridge offender whose behaviour has affected businesses and members of the public.

"His time in prison will provide some respite to the community while he will hopefully take advantage of the support he's being given to stop his offending.

"Any reports of him breaching his CBO will be dealt with robustly."
