A man who died after a four-vehicle collision on the A16 at Newborough last week has been named.

Officers were called to the collision involving a Honda motorcycle, Peugeot Boxer, Vauxhall Insignia and a Fiat Punto just before 6am on Friday (7 February).

Emergency services attended and the rider of the motorcycle - Simon Rayner, 51, of Thomas Road, Spalding - was pronounced dead at the scene despite the best efforts of paramedics.

Another driver was taken to Peterborough City Hospital with minor injuries.

The driver of the Peugeot Boxer - a 28-year-old man from Spalding, Lincolnshire - was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of drink or drugs. He has since been released under investigation.

Anyone who witnessed the collision or the events leading up to it, or who has dashcam footage, is asked to call police on 101 quoting incident 65 of the 7 February. Alternatively, information can be reported online via www.cambs.police.uk/report.
