We were called just after 12pm today (19 November) to reports of concerns for eight people travelling westbound in a lorry on the A14.

Officers stopped the vehicle near Brampton Hut.

The air ambulance attended the scene and the road was closed while emergency services dealt with the incident.

Three people were taken to hospital, but no one was seriously injured.

One man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of assisting unlawful immigration.

The investigation and welfare of the people involved will be handed to the immigration services.

Enquiries continue.
