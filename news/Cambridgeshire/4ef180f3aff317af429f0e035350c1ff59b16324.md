Two men have been arrested after a search at a Peterborough house uncovered drugs, cash and a weapon.

A warrant was carried out in Gladstone Street this morning (Wednesday 23 December) by the eastern Neighbourhood Policing Team.

On searching the property, officers found a CS cannister, cannabis, suspected forged bank notes, about Â£10,000 in cash and several mobile phones, all of which have been seized.

Two men aged 23 and 28 were arrested on suspicion of being in possession of a Section 5 firearm (CS spray), money laundering, possession of cannabis and possession of counterfeit currency.

Both are in custody at Thorpe Wood Police Station.
