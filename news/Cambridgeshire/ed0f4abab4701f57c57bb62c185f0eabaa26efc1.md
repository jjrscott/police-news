AN abusive alcoholic who controlled and repeatedly attacked his girlfriend has been jailed.

Przemyslaw Puk, 41, beat his girlfriend on multiple occasions, often avoiding her face to prevent obvious bruising that may have raised concern.

As part of his abusive regime, he would not allow her to meet with friends or family unless he was present.

Additionally, Puk would often force the victim to accompany him if he left the house so he knew what she was doing at all times.

It was on one of these occasions - a probation meeting he was attending for a previous offence - that the victim told staff of the abuse and said she was scared to go home with him.

The victim told police that in the week leading to Puk's arrest on 17 November he had punched her numerous times in the body and slapped her in the face.

On Tuesday (30 January) Puk, of Belsize Avenue, Peterborough, was found guilty of breaching a suspended sentence and two counts of battery following a trial at Cambridge Crown Court. He was sentenced to 14 months imprisonment and made subject of a restraining order preventing him from contacting the victim for the next five years.

Detective Constable Lisa Marston said: "We hope this sentence will give other victims of domestic abuse the courage to come forward and speak to the police.

"Ironically, the manipulative way this offender controlled the victim gave her a platform to seek help. We would like to urge other people experiencing domestic abuse to do the same and not suffer in silence."
