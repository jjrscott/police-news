Two men were arrested yesterday morning (Wednesday 3 April) following a police pursuit from Cambridge to Waterbeach.

The men, aged 19 and 20, both from Cambridge, were arrested in School Lane, Chittering after they were located thanks to the assistance of a police helicopter and Police Dog Bane.

Traffic officers directed the driver of a Toyota Rav 4 to stop in Cambridge, however he made off leading officers on a pursuit to Waterbeach, through fields before fleeing the vehicle on foot and setting it on fire.

PD Bane sniffed out the driver and his passenger who were hiding in bushes. The men were arrested on suspicion of a number of offences including failing to stop for police, theft of a motor vehicle, arson, criminal damage and dangerous driving. They have since been released under investigation.
