We are appealing for information after a man was bitten by a dog in Newmarket.

At 5.45pm on Saturday (26 September), the victim, a man in his 30s, was walking along a grass area next to the football field in Cricket Field Road when a small dark coloured dog ran over and bit him on the leg causing puncture marks.

The dog was off the lead at the time and no owner appeared to be nearby.

PC Rebecca Neville said: "This was a scary experience for the victim who was alone but thankfully managed to walk to a friend's house nearby.

"I would like to appeal for witnesses, or the person who owns the dog, to get in touch so we can try to prevent this from happening again."

Anyone with any information should call us on 101, quoting crime reference number 35/65578/20 or visit www.cambs.police.uk/report. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
