Officers have released CCTV images of three men they would like to speak to following a burglary in Royston.

On Monday 19 November 2018, the owners of a farm house undergoing renovation discovered their house had been broken into and a number of high-value items had been taken. Among the items stolen were three Rolex watches and a safe containing high value jewellery and more than Â£5000 in cash. A credit card was also taken during the break-in and the images show the card being used at Tesco in Newmarket.

Officers are keen to identify the men in the CCTV images and urge anyone who may know who they are to pass on information by reporting online at www.cambs.police.uk/report and quoting 35/46063/18, or you can call 101.
