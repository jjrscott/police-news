A disqualified driver who crashed his car while driving more than three times over the limit has been convicted.

Adrian Plumb, 53, was driving a white Smart car when he lost control and collided with a pedestrian crossing on Queen Edith's Way, Cambridge at about midday on Monday (27 July).

He provided a breath sample in custody, which provided a reading of 108 micrograms of alcohol in 100ml of breath - more than three times the legal drink drive limit of 35 micrograms.

During a virtual appearance at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on Wednesday (29 July) he pleaded guilty to drink driving, driving without insurance and driving whilst disqualified.

Plumb, of Bramley Avenue, Melbourn was given a 12-week sentence, suspended for two years. He must complete 240 hours unpaid work and pay a Â£233 fine. He was also disqualified from driving for four years.

PC James Bayer said: "Plumb was lucky there was no one on the crossing at the time of the collision.

"There is no excuse for driving whilst under the influence of alcohol."
