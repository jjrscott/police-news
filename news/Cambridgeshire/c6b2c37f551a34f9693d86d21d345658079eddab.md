We are appealing for information following a serious collision involving two cars near Peterborough yesterday (2 November).

The head-on collision involving a grey Citroen C3 and a blue Land Rover Defender happened at about 7.50pm in Black Drove, near Thorney.

The driver and sole-occupant of the Citroen, a man in his 60s, and the driver of the Land Rover, a woman in her 40s, were taken to Peterborough City Hospital and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, in Kings Lynn, respectively where they remain in critical but stable conditions.

Two passengers from the Land Rover, a 13-year-old girl and a woman in her 40s, were also taken to hospital where they remain with serious injuries.

Four other children who were travelling in the Land Rover were treated at the scene for whiplash.

Anyone who saw the collision or either vehicle in the lead up to it, or has dash cam footage, is urged to contact us via web chat or by calling 101, quoting incident number 419 of 2 November.
