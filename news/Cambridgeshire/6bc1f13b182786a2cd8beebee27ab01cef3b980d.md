Officers have released CCTV images of a man they would like to speak to in connection with fraud in Peterborough.

The incident happened on 13 October when a man knocked on an elderly woman's door in The Steynings, Werrington, claiming her gutters needed cleaning.

After 30 minutes of work the woman was charged Â£250 and driven to a nearby cashpoint in Staniland Way to withdraw the money.
