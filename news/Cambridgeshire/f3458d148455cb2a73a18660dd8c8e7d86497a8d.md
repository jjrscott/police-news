A man who imported prohibited weapons into the country has been sentenced.

Intelligence was received that Otto Bacharach, 59, of Vawser Way, Cambridge, had bought a number of weapons from a Spanish website in July last year.

When officers arrived at his home they found three pistols and a revolver as well as cartridges for the revolver.

Bacharach was sentenced to eight weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months at Cambridge Magistrates' Court on Thursday (8 October) after previously pleading guilty to four counts of possession of a weapon for the discharge of a noxious liquid/gas/electrical incapacitation device.

Detective Constable Hamish Cowley said: "While we realise some weapons are advertised online and seem accessible, it is an offence to import them and we will act on any intelligence in relation to these kinds of offences.

"We will continue to take weapons off the streets of Cambridge to make the city a safer place."
