A Peterborough man has been sentenced for outraging public decency.

Paul Mason, 61, of Hawksbill Way, pleaded guilty at Cambridge Magistrates' Court and was given an 18 week prison sentence yesterday (11 November).

The crime took place just after 10am on 22 September on The Causeway in Godmanchester.

He must also pay Â£100 in compensation.

PC Jacob Young said: "Outraging public decency is a common law offence, where it has to be proved that the act or display is of an obscene or disgusting nature sufficient to outrage contemporary standards of decency.

"It has to occur within a place accessible to or within view or the public and the perpetrator knew that the act was obscene or disgusting."
