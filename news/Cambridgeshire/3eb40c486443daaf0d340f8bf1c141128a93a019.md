A man who tried to sneak drugs into prison by concealing them between his thighs has been sentenced.

Wesley Downing, 40, was on his way back from the visitors' hall at HMP Peterborough on 9 December, 2018, after being visited by Anthony Spring, 30, when one of the prison guards noticed something between his thighs during a search.

The package was later found to contain cannabis and tobacco estimated to be worth up to Â£3,800.

Prison staff reviewed the CCTV footage from the visitors' hall and noticed Spring pass a white package to Downing, which he then put down the back of his trousers.

Downing of address unknown pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply class B and was sentenced to 18 months in prison, on top of an existing sentence.

Spring, of HMP Peterborough, pleaded guilty to bringing a list A prohibited article into prison and was sentenced to 18 months in prison, also on top of an existing sentence.

DC Mark Clapham, who investigated, said: "This pair thought they could cheat the system but they were wrong.

"We take these cases very seriously and the sentences show the courts do too."
