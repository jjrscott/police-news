Two people have been arrested after a pursuit in Peterborough this morning involving a suspected stolen car.

Officers were called at 9.45am today with reports of a suspected stolen car on the A14 at Keyston.

The car - a Toyota Yaris - was identified on ANPR heading on the A605 at Oundle and failed to stop for officers.

A pursuit began, with the car travelling at speeds of 100mph, and the NPAS police helicopter also assisted together with armed officers.

The vehicle was stopped in Yaxley after officers deployed a stinger. Two people have been arrested at the scene.
