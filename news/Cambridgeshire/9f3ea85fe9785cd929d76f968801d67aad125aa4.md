Detectives investigating a high-value burglary are appealing for information.

Officers were called to a house in Ekin Road, Cambridge on 21 March following reports of a burglary.

At about 6.45pm two men, wearing illuminous jackets and with their faces covered, knocked on the door of a property and a man in his 80s answered.

One of the men pushed him to the floor and pinned him down while the other ransacked his house.

The men stole Â£12,000 in cash before fleeing.

DC Victoria Norden, who is investigating, said: "This was a terrifying ordeal for the victim who has lost a serious amount of money and been left shaken by the incident

"I am urging anybody with information to get in touch as a matter of urgency."
