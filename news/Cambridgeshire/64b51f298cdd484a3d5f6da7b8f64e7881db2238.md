A lorry driver, over the drink drive limit, who drove the wrong way down the A1139 in Peterborough has been jailed for 12 weeks.

Cristian Murariu, 48, from Romania, was sentenced at Peterborough Magistrate's Court yesterday (23 July) after pleading guilty to dangerous driving and drink driving.

Officers were called at 1am on Sunday (July 22) to reports of Murariu driving his lorry the wrong way down the road with no lights on. A lorry driver close by managed to get into the vehicle to stop it and when officers attended Murariu was three times over the drink drive limit. He was arrested at the scene.

PC Jon Morris, Casualty Reduction Officer, said: "Murariu endangered the lives of other road users and although thankfully no one was hurt it could have easily been a different story.

"Driving under the influence is unacceptable and we will continue to do everything we can to make the roads safer.

"We would ask people to help us by reporting anyone they believe drink drives so we can ensure they are dealt with."

Murariu received a two year driving ban, was ordered to pay a Â£115 victim surcharge and will have to take an extended retest before he gets his license.

Anyone who suspects someone of drink driving can contact police via their confidential drink drive hotline on 0800 032 0845.
