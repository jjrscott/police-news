A man has been charged in connection with the discovery of about Â£183,000 worth of drugs in Peterborough.

The 21-year-old was arrested in Royce Road, Boongate yesterday afternoon (Wednesday 24 June) after we were alerted to a suspected drug deal in nearby Padholme Road.

He has been charged with possession with intent to supply class A drugs, possession with intent to supply class B drugs and possession of a weapon designed for the discharge of a noxious liquid, namely CS spray, and remanded in custody to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court tomorrow (Friday 26 June).

A second man, also 21, was arrested alongside him, however he has been released under investigation.
