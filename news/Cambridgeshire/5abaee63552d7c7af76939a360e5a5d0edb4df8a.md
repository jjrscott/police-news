Two men are in custody after we discovered evidence of class A drug dealing at houses in Peterborough.

The Community Action Team carried out warrants at houses in Sunnymead in Werrington and Beeston Drive in Stanground this morning (Friday 18 September).

Class A drugs in 38 'deal bags' and two golf-ball size rocks were seized, along with Â£3,615 in cash from the house in Sunnymead.

A 34-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs and fraud by false representation.

A 27-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs.

Both men remain in custody at Thorpe Wood Police Station.
