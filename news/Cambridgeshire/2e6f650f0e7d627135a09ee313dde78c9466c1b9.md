A prolific criminal from Peterborough has been told he will spend the next four months in prison.

Christopher Pycroft, 35, of no fixed address, was arrested on Thursday (26 July) in connection with a number of incidents including making threats to other people and theft.

On Friday (27 July) he was charged with using threatening behaviour and theft from a motor vehicle and remanded to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court later that day.

He admitted the charges against him and was sentenced to 14 weeks, with an additional two weeks for being recalled to prison while out on licence for other offences. One other offence of threatening behaviour was also taken into consideration by the judge when sentencing.

Detective Sergeant Michael Johnson said: "Pycroft has been causing issues for the city for some time and now he will be off our streets for four months.

"I would encourage anyone who may have been a victim of Pycroft's behaviour and has not reported it to police, to contact us."

Crime can be reported online at www.cambs.police.uk/report or call 101.
