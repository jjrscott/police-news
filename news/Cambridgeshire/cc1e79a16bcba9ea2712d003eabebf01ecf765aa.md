A teenager has admitted possessing crack cocaine, heroin and cannabis after being arrested at the age of 16.

Patrik Kotlar, now 18, was charged with the offences in January this year (2020) after initially being arrested in September 2018 on suspicion of drug supply offences in Peterborough.

He was seen by officers in the Eastfield Road area to be acting suspiciously, when spoken to by them and asked if he had anything he shouldn't, he handed over a bag of cannabis.

Following this admission Kotlar was then searched but tried to run off from officers. Inside his bag more cannabis was found, along with a kitchen knife.

Kotlar was arrested and taken into custody where a package containing crack cocaine and heroin was found in his trouser leg.

In October 2018 Kotlar, of Geneva Street in Peterborough, was charged with possessing a knife in a public place and was made subject of an eight-month referral order.

PC Beckie Hallam said: "A referral order is the first community sentence given to most first-time young offenders, requiring them to attend a youth offender panel made up of two members of the local community and an advisor from a youth offending team, where they will agree a contract of certain commitments."

In January this year Kotlar was charged with possession with intent to supply heroin, crack cocaine and cannabis, however he pleaded guilty to lesser offences of possession of the drugs which was accepted in court.

On Thursday (13 August), he appeared at Peterborough Crown Court where he was sentenced to a 12-month community order and must complete a 40-hour rehabilitation activity requirement (RAR).

PC Hallam added: "It's always concerning to see such young people getting involved with drugs. Kotlar's sentence means he will be getting help to steer him away from this life choice and hopefully take him down a different path."
