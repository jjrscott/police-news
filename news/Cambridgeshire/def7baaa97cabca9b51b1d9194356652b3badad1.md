Officers investigating a fatal collision in Peterborough on Wednesday (22 August) are appealing to motorists who may have been in the area prior to the incident.

In particular they are keen to trace the driver of a 4x4 travelling near Etton, Peterborough during the afternoon.

The driver and other road users nearby may have seen an incident involving a silver Saab 93, which was later involved in a fatal collision on Bretton Way at 5.25pm.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Sergeant James Thorne on 101.
