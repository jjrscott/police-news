Detectives investigating the murder of a man in Wisbech earlier this month have arrested a sixth person.

Tom Lewis (pictured below), 23, of Larksfield in Wisbech, was airlifted to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge from Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Kings Lynn on Tuesday, 8 September, to undergo surgery to his leg after he was stabbed in Norwich Road in the early hours of the morning.

He was placed on life-support in intensive care but was pronounced dead on 10 September after a decision was made to end his life-support treatment.

An 18-year-old man from Kings Lynn was arrested this morning (Tuesday 22 September) in Wisbech on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder. He remains in custody at Thorpe Wood Police Station in Peterborough.

Five men aged 18, 22, 23 and two aged 32, were arrested on suspicion of murder earlier this month, however they have all since been released from custody pending further investigation.

Anyone with any information is urged to contact us via our web-chat or by calling 101, quoting investigation reference 35/60797/20.
