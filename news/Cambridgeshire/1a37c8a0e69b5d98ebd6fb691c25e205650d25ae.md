A man has been arrested following the discovery of a cannabis farm in Alconbury.

Acting on information received from members of the public, officers from the Huntingdon neighbourhood policing team visited a property on Alconbury Hill yesterday afternoon (1 October).

They forced entry into the house and found around 370 cannabis plants with a potential street value of up to Â£310,000. The plants and growing equipment have been seized.

A 47-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of cultivating cannabis at the scene and taken to Thorpe Wood police station where he remains.
