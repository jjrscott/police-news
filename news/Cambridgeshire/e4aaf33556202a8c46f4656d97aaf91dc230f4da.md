A drug dealer who was caught with thousands of pounds worth of drugs and cash has been jailed for two and a half years.

Matthew Royal, 34, had his home in Quaker Way, Chatteris, raided under the Misuse of Drugs Act on 10 August last year.

Royal immediately handed over almost 100g of cannabis, with an estimated street value of approximately £1,000.

Police continued to search his home and found another 45g of cannabis, worth an estimated £430, 6g of cocaine, worth up to £600, and more than £500 in cash.

Forensic examination of his mobile phone also revealed drug-related messages.

On Thursday (17 September) at Peterborough Crown Court, Royal was jailed after pleading guilty to possessing a class A drug with intent to supply, possessing a class B drug with intent to supply, offering to supply cocaine and offering to supply cannabis at an earlier hearing.

DC Jacob Reeves said: "Despite Royal's initial honesty, we found a lot more drugs hidden in his home.

"Drugs can devastate lives and our message is clear: don't deal drugs in Cambridgeshire."
