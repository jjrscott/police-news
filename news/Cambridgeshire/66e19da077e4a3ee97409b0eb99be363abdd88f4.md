A man who hid drugs in his socks has been jailed for 30 months.

Acting on intelligence received from members of the public, officers from the Southern Impact Team carried out a warrant at Erjon Madani's home address in Lynn Road, Chettisham on 13 December last year.

They found £235 stashed inside a pair of shorts, £6k inside a waste bin and 100 bags of white powder hidden in two socks as well as other drug paraphernalia and mobile phones.

Last week (23 April) at Peterborough Crown Court the 27-year-old was jailed for 30 months after previously pleading guilty to two counts of possession with intent to supply class A drugs.

PC Luke Upcott from the Impact Team said: "Drugs wreak havoc on people's lives, trapping them in addiction and causing misery for communities.

"Drug dealing can often be linked to violence, intimidation and other offences as people desperately try to feed their addictions. We're committed to bringing dealers like Madani before the courts."
