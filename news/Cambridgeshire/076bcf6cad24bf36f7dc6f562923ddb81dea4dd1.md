A woman from Peterborough has admitted interfering with a vehicle with intent to steal from it.

Selina Gearing, 50, of Crown Street, was arrested on Sunday morning (21 June) following reports of suspicious behaviour in Westwood.

At about 5.30am we were called after a woman was seen trying to enter cars in Edgcote Close. We were deployed and arrested Gearing.

She was later charged with interfering with a motor vehicle with intent to steal and remanded for court.

Yesterday (Monday 22 June) Gearing appeared at Peterborough Magistrates' Court where she admitted the offence and was ordered to pay a total fine of £195 - an £80 fine, £85 in court costs and a £30 victim surcharge.
