Officers have released CCTV images of an armed robbery as part of an appeal for information.

At about 5pm yesterday (Tuesday, 16 January) two men with covered faces entered the One Stop convenience store in High Street, Buckden.

One had a shotgun and demanded customers and staff lay on the floor while they took money from a safe and tills.

They then left through the front door and fled to separate vehicles.

Approximately Â£8,000 worth of stock, stamps and cash was stolen. Fortunately no one was injured.

Officers are appealing to the public to identify the two men pictured in the CCTV images.
