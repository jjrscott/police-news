We are encouraging people to take part in this year's Ride to Work Day which promotes safe motorcycling.

The Cambridgeshire Police BikeSafe team is taking part in the event on Monday, 18 June, between the Lazy Dayz Cafe, on the A603, through to Shire Hall, in Cambridge.

The cafe opens early for breakfast prior to the riders leaving for a fully-escorted ride through the heart of Cambridge city centre, finishing at Cambridgeshire County Council Headquarters (Shire Hall).

PC Simon Burgin said: "This fully-escorted ride is aimed at promoting motorcycling as a fun and sustainable alternative to the car, which also eases congestion.

"Motorcyclists are among the most vulnerable road users and for them road safety is vital.

"It is important to encourage motorcyclists to sign up to BikeSafe to help increase their ability and confidence, so they can get even more enjoyment from riding.

"We hope motorcyclists will get on their bikes and join us at the Lazy Dayz Cafe from 7.30am. The ride leaves at 8am."

BikeSafe workshops provide detailed briefings on hazard awareness and how to make motorcycling safer. For more details on the BikeSafe workshops visit www.bikesafe.co.uk.

The Ride to Work Day is being run in partnership with Cambridge and Peterborough Road Safety Partnership and is supported nationally by the Motorcycle Industry Association (MCIA), Get On - Life's better on two wheels and Think Department for Transport.
