We're appealing for witnesses to a collision involving a car and a stolen motorbike in East Cambridgeshire.

The collision took place just before 2pm on Thursday (2 May) on the B1102 Swaffham Road between Lode and Long Meadow.

When officers arrived both the driver of the car and the rider of the motorbike - a White Honda - had left the scene.

Officers would like to speak to those involved and are appealing for anyone with dash cam footage, or anyone or who may have seen anything, to come forward.

Anyone with information should contact us on 101, quoting incident number 236 of 2 May, or alternatively report it online at www.cambs.police.uk/report.
