A man who was caught with more than £600 worth of cannabis at his home in Peterborough has been sentenced.

Luke Hamilton, 34, was caught with multiple boxes of cannabis, mobile phones and scales at his home in Oundle Road, Peterborough.

At around 8am on 20 December 2018 officers from the neighbourhood policing team carried out a warrant at the address.

Officers searched the property and seized seven clear boxes filled with cannabis, a set of scales and two mobile phones.

Further analysis found the cannabis weighed 62 grams, worth a value about £610 and the mobile phones had text messages associated with the illegal sale of the Class B drug.

Hamilton pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply a class B drug and was sentenced to nine months in prison, suspended for two years, at Peterborough Crown Court on Thursday (5 March 2020).That

PC Melanie Mathieson said: "This warrant stopped cannabis from reaching the streets of Peterborough.

"Drugs can devastate lives and are often linked to other forms of criminality such as violence and burglary. As a result, we're working hard to tackle both drug dealing and production in our county."
