Officers have charged a man with being in charge of a vehicle while over the legal alcohol limit and driving without insurance after calls from members of the public.

Valerij Jastrebov, 51, of St Peter's Road, Wisbech, was arrested in March just after 7am yesterday morning (1 November) after reports a driver was allegedly slumped behind the wheel.

He was breathalysed at the scene and provided a reading of 126 microgrammes of alcohol in 100ml of breath - the legal limit being 35.

Jastrebov is due to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court today (2 November).

Anyone who wishes to report concerns around someone drink or drug driving can call the force's dedicated, confidential hotline on 0800 032 0845.

The hotline is available 24/7, and gives people the opportunity to supply police with information to help reduce the number of drink drivers on Cambridgeshire's roads.
