We have uncovered a cannabis factory in St Neots worth up to an estimated Â£294,000.

Officers were responding to reports of a burglary in Skipper Way, Little Paxton, at about midday yesterday (4 December).

They forced entry after hearing people inside and uncovered approximately 350 cannabis plants at various stages of growth.

Two men, aged 21 and 23, were found hiding in the loft and were arrested.

Both men have since been charged with producing a controlled class B drug and are due to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court tomorrow (6 December).

Sgt John Keerie said: "This find has stopped a substantial amount of illegal drugs finding their way to the streets.

"I would encourage anybody who suspects illegal drug activity in their area to get in touch."

Information about illegal drug activity can be reported via www.cambs.police.uk/report or by calling 101.
