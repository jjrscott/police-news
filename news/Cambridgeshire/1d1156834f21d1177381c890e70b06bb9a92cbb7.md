We have released images of jewellery we suspect to have been stolen in a bid to reunite them with their rightful owners.

The three items have been recovered as part of an ongoing investigation into thefts in Peterborough.

PC Hannah Wheatley said: "One of the items is a small gold heart-shaped locket with a photo of a man inside. We are hoping someone will recognise this and get in touch."

Anyone who believes they are the owners of any of the items pictured should get in touch with police by contacting 101.
