Detectives are appealing for the public's help in identifying two men they would like to speak to in connection with a burglary in Littleport at the weekend.

In the early hours of Saturday (8 August), a resident in Yeomans Way, a woman in her 30s, was woken up by footsteps outside her home.

When the woman checked outside she saw a man trying to fit something into the boot of a blue Peugeot 206, driving away moments later.

Shortly after a second man was seen riding her husband's bike worth about £1,000, connected to a turbo trainer worth approximately £200, down the road.

The victims went downstairs to check their garage where they discovered tools worth about £1,000, a sound system worth £350 and a computer monitor had also been stolen.

Detective Sergeant Ashley Ryan, of the force's southern burglary team, said: "Burglary can have a devastating impact on victims, which is why tackling it is a priority for the force.

"I am urging anybody who recognises the men pictured, or has any information about the burglary, to get in touch."
