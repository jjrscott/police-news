We have released images of a number of signs which have been stolen from a home in Fen Ditton.

Offenders broke into a barn in High Street between 8pm on Wednesday (14 March) and 11am Thursday (15 March) but took nothing.

However they stole six vintage tin advertising signs displayed on the front of the barn.

The signs are part of the village's heritage and recognised as local landmarks. The barn has been in place since the 1920s.

We have released images of a number of signs which have been stolen from a home in Fen Ditton.

PC Kieran Watts said: "The victim has been left very upset by what has happened as the stolen signs were collected by her late husband.

"I would appeal to anyone who has any information about the incident, or who may have seen people acting suspiciously in the area, to contact police.

"I would also appeal to anyone who has been offered to buy any of the signs to contact us."

Anyone with information regarding this incident should call police on 101 quoting CF0139220318 or visit www.cambs.police.uk/report. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
