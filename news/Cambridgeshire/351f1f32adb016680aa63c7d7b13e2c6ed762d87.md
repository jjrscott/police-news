A man and two teenage boys have been arrested in connection with violence in Dogsthorpe this morning (Thursday 21 May).

We were called to Welland Road at 10.35am following reports that a number of people had been assaulted and weapons had been used.

An investigation is ongoing, however at least two people have sustained injuries consistent with pellets. It is not believed any of the injuries are life-threatening.

One of the victims, a 14-year-old boy, is receiving treatment at Peterborough City Hospital.

Two 14-year-old boys and a 33-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent and are currently in custody at Thorpe Wood Police Station.

Part of Welland Road was closed while police dealt with the incident, however it has since reopened.

Anyone with information about the incident is urged to contact us either by calling 101 or reporting online at www.cambs.police.uk/report.
