Police action has been taken against a man in Peterborough as part of an operation to tackle issues of begging and anti-social behaviour (ASB).

Earl Allen, 48, was arrested at his home address in Oundle Road yesterday morning (Monday 21 September) on suspicion of breaching a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO).

He has since been charged with two counts of breaching a CBO, specifically begging, and has been remanded to appear at Cambridge Magistrates' Court today (Tuesday 22 September).

Operation Luscombe, which launched last week, aims to identify issues and support those who are living on the streets, often found begging and causing ASB.

It is a partnership initiative between neighbourhood policing officers, Peterborough City Council, drugs and alcohol support services, health care professionals, Department for Work and Pensions and the Light Project Peterborough - all those who can help get them off the streets and reduce associated issues.

The aim is primarily to provide support for these individuals but this should also help to reduce the demand on all agencies involved.
