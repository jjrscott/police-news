A burglar who stole £8,000 worth of jewellery has been jailed for more than two years.

Kyle Potter, 21, smashed a conservatory door to get into a house in Station Road, Swavesey, on 20 August.

While inside the empty house he picked up £8,000 worth of jewellery including rings and necklaces before fleeing.

Traces of blood found on the smashed window were found and linked to Potter, who was subsequently arrested in Leicestershire.

Potter, of Martin Street, Leicester, was jailed for 876 days at Cambridge Crown Court on Thursday (8 October) after pleading guilty to burglary.

DC Neil Gibbs, who investigated, said: "This was a brazen burglary which saw a staggering amount of jewellery stolen.

"However thanks to forensic evidence we were able to bring Potter to justice and offer some closure to the victims."
