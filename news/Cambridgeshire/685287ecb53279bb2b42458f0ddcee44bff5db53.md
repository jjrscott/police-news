Thirteen people have been arrested over the course of a week in Cambridgeshire as part of a national crackdown on drugs networking.

Last week saw a national week of action targeting county lines drug gangs across the country, with local activity taking place in Cambridge and Peterborough.

The activity, co-ordinated by the National County Lines Coordination Centre (NCLCC), which is jointly run by the National Crime Agency (NCA) and National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC), was led by police forces and Regional Organised Crime Units (ROCUs).

Over the week activity included warrants at addresses, visits to vulnerable people including those at risk of cuckooing, and engagement with those who are being exploited by county lines networks.

In Cambridge four men and two teenage boys were arrested and crack cocaine and heroin worth about £730 was seized, along with £2,576 in cash.

In Peterborough five men and two teenage boys were arrested and crack cocaine, heroin and cannabis worth about £1,200 was seized, along with £600 in cash.

Chief Constable Nick Dean said: "Drug networks bring a whole host of criminality to our county, including violence and exploitation which I have set as priorities for us as a force to tackle.

"While we have seen some excellent work from local policing teams during this week of action, the work to tackle these gangs does not stop. We will continue to be relentless in our approach to making Cambridgeshire a hostile environment for criminals to operate in, making our county a safer place."
