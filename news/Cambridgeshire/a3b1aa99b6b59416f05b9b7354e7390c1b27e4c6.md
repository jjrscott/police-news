We have released CCTV images of the moment a St Ives shop was robbed at knifepoint.

Two men entered the shop in London Road at about 7.20pm last night (22 March) and threatened a shop worker, a man in his 20s.

In total the men made off with £600 in cash, £2,000 worth of cigarettes and a bottle of wine.

DC Lisa Bacon, who is investigating, said: "This was an extremely traumatic incident and has left the worker understandably shaken.

"I am urging anybody who recognises those pictured, or has any information no matter how insignificant it may seem, to get in touch."

Anyone who recognises the men or has information regarding the incident should call police on 101 quoting 35/21012/20 or visit our website. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via their website.
