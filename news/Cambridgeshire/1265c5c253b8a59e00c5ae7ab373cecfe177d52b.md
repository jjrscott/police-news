A woman who has been causing anti-social behaviour in Cambridge for more than three years has been handed a criminal behaviour order.

Lorna Webb, 51, of Willow Walk, Cambridge was given the order following a long spell of shoplifting and intimidating behaviour in Mill Road.

The order was issued following Webb's conviction at Cambridge Magistrates' Court on 25 November where she pleaded guilty to three counts of criminal damage to property under Â£5,000, two counts of theft, two counts of assault by beating of an emergency worker and being drunk and disorderly in a public place.

It stipulates that she must not enter Mill Road for two years. Webb also received an 18-month community order and 28 day rehabilitation activity requirement.

PC Leigh Browne said: "Webb's behaviour has caused members of the Mill Road community including residents, business owners and visitors harassment, alarm and distress for many years. Her behaviour is intimidating, disruptive and aggressive and often puts fear into the community.

"The order will protect the community from further harm."
