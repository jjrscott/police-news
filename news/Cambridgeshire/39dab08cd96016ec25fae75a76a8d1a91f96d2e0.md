We have released images of items we believe to have been stolen in a bid to reunite them with their rightful owners.

A 'bag for life' was discovered in an alleyway in Hyholmes, Bretton, on Wednesday (26 February), containing a large amount of what police believe to be stolen goods.

DC Tom Hunt said: "Some of the items we have recovered are particularly distinctive, with photographs on some of the items of jewellery.

"If you believe any of the pictured items belong to you please do get in touch."

Anyone who believes any of the items belong to them, or knows who they might belong to, should contact us by calling 101 and quoting 35/14613/20.
