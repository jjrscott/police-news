A South Cambridgeshire man has been handed a suspended sentence for sexually assaulting a woman.

 Alvin Scott, 53, of Priory Avenue, Swavesey, made inappropriate comments and groped a woman on Friday 21 July.

 Scott denied charges of sexual assault but was found guilty following a five day trial at Cambridge Crown Court.

 He was sentenced yesterday (23 August) to 12 months in prison suspended for two years, 200 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay Â£2000 compensation to his victim.

 Scott has also been placed on the sex offenders register for ten years.

 DC Andrew Moralee said: "I would like to commend the victim for showing tremendous courage in coming forward to police.

 "This sentence shows the tough stance the criminal justice system takes towards sexual assault and will hopefully make potential offenders think twice before harming someone."
