Officers are currently at the scene of a serious collision in Southgate Way, Peterborough.

The collision, which involved a Vauxhall Astra and Mercedes Sprinter, happened at about 1.40am today (26 May).

Officers and paramedics attended, but despite their best efforts a man in his 40s who was a passenger in the Astra died at the scene.

The driver of the vehicle fled the area on foot before emergency services arrived.

Two women, aged 27 and 35, who are believed to have been in the Astra have been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and kidnap. They are both currently receiving hospital treatment for serious, but not life threatening, injuries.

Three men aged 24, 37 and 41 have been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. They remain in custody. Two of the men are from Peterborough and the third is of no known address.

The road is closed and an investigation is ongoing.
