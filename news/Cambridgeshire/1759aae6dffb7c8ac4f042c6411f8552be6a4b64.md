Detectives investigating a stabbing in the early hours of yesterday morning (27 April) in Peterborough are appealing for information.

At about 12.20am a man in his 30s was stabbed in Saltmarsh, Orton Malborne, by a group of men. He was taken to hospital, where he remains in a critical but stable condition.

It is believed the victim was targeted and that this is an isolated incident.

Detective Sergeant Liz Cooper said: "Although this incident happened late at night, it was in a residential area and close to a route regularly used by cyclists and pedestrians. There may have been people in the vicinity at the time of the attack who we need to speak to.

"We're appealing to people who saw this attack, or a group acting suspiciously in the area to contact us or Crimestoppers as a matter of urgency."

Anyone with information regarding this incident should call police on 101 quoting 35/28941/19 or visit www.cambs.police.uk/report. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
