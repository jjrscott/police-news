A drug dealer who was arrested after being stopped and searched in the street by police has been handed a suspended sentence.

Daniel Hinds, 24, of Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, pleaded guilty to two counts of possession with intent to supply class A drugs, crack cocaine and heroin, at Cambridge Crown Court in August last year.

The court heard how Hinds was found in St Andrews Street, Cambridge, on 17 April, with 19 wraps of heroin and three wraps of crack cocaine, which he claimed were for his personal use.

He was also found with Â£595 and a mobile phone containing text messages relating to drug dealing.

Today he was sentenced to two years, suspended for two years.

PC Andre Willmore said: "Hinds was operating a drugs line from London to Cambridge. The quantity of drugs in his possession demonstrated that he was dealing."
