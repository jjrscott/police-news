Members of the public are being warned following a spate of theft from vehicles in Peterborough in the last week.

Since New Year's Eve (31 December) there have been a significant number of reported thefts from vehicles in the Eye and Cardea area.

Patrols have been stepped up in the areas affected, however vehicle owners are being asked to take simple precautions to reduce the risk of being targeted.

It is advised you:

 * Ensure all doors, windows and sunroofs are closed and locked when leaving your vehicle unattended - double checking doors are locked before leaving it
 * Never leave valuables in your vehicle and keep any other possessions out of sight. Remove your sat nav and its holder and wipe away any window suction marks as these could indicate a sat nav is stored in your vehicle
 * If you use a vehicle for maintenance purposes, it is advisable not to leave tools or other working materials in a vehicle unoccupied or overnight, as works vehicles such as vans are commonly targeted by criminals

Further advice can be found on the Cambridgeshire Constabulary website at www.cambs.police.uk/A-Z/vehicle-security.

Detective Sergeant Mark Plitsch said: "While we are working hard to identify who is responsible for these thefts, we would urge members of the public to double check their vehicles are locked before leaving it and ensure any valuables are removed, even if they are out of sight an opportunist thief will take what they can find if they come across an unlocked door."

Anyone with information about this series, or who sees any suspicious activity, is asked to contact police by calling 101 or reporting online at www.cambs.police.uk/report.
