A man who burgled a house in Ely was caught soon after when a member of the public reported him falling around and "out of control" on drugs.

Stephen Neal, 31, broke into the house in Lynn Road between 1am and 7am on Friday 30 March by forcing open French doors. He stole a UK Passport, a driving license and a wallet containing £200.

At just after 7.30am, officers were called to Elmfield, in Ely, to reports of a man "out of control on drugs". Neal, of High Barns, Ely, was arrested and found to be in possession of the stolen cash and documents.

On Wednesday (1 August), Neal pleaded guilty to burglary at Cambridge Crown Court and was sentenced to three years in prison. He was also ordered to pay the victim £200 compensation.

DC Sean Denby said: "Stephen Neal is a prolific offender with this incident marking his third burglary and has received a sentence which reflects this.

"This conviction should serve as a warning to anyone thinking of committing burglary. It remains a priority for the force and officers are actively seeking to disrupt and bring offenders to justice."
