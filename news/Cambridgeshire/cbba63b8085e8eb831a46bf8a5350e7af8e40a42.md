A man found growing 675 cannabis plants in Great Shelford has been jailed.

Acting on information received from members of the pubic, officers paid a visit to a farm in Cherry Hinton Road on 20 September last year.

They discovered two units containing the cannabis plants, with a street value of up to £564,000 and arrested 32-year-old Liam Peposhi at the scene.

Peposhi admitted cultivating the cannabis but claimed he was doing it to pay off a £16,000 debt.

At Huntingdon Crown Court on Monday (29 March) he pleaded guilty to production of cannabis and was sentenced to two years in prison.

PC Alex Oliver said: "Thanks to information received from members of the public, we were able to shut down this cannabis factory. We can't be everywhere and we rely on people in our communities being our eyes and ears. If you suspect something isn't right, it more than likely isn't."

We would encourage people to look out for signs of illegal cannabis factories including blacked out windows and people coming and going at various times of the day.
