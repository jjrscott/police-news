Officers have released images of items stolen in a burglary in Peterborough, with the hope of reuniting them with their owner.

Jewellery and other goods worth more than Â£5,000 were taken on Friday 21 August, from a house in Overton Way, Orton Waterville, Peterborough.

The bottom half of the victim's front door was damaged to gain entry to the property before the thieves ransacked the house.

The stolen items included: bracelets, watches, rings and a handbag.

The victim said: "The sentimental value means far more to us than the price tag.

"Some of the items were mementos from holidays with our children, others were heirlooms - handed down from family members who are no longer with us."

An investigation has been launched following the incident, with additional police patrols in the area.

Anyone who recognises the items pictured, or who may have been offered similar items for sale, is urged to contact us via our web-chat or by calling 101 quoting crime reference 35/56565/20.
