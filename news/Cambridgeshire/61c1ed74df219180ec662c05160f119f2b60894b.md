A man has been arrested after a cannabis factory was discovered in East Cambridgeshire.

Officers discovered the plants yesterday evening (26 March) at a house in High Street, Cheveley, after being called there on an unrelated matter.

More than 35 cannabis plants in various stages of growth, together with growing equipment, were seized from the house.

The plants are estimated to have a street value of up to Â£30,000 if all were to reach maturity.

The 39-year-old man from Cheveley has been arrested on suspicion of producing cannabis and remains in custody at Parkside Police Station.

He was also arrested on suspicion of criminal damage after allegedly damaging a neighbour's property.
