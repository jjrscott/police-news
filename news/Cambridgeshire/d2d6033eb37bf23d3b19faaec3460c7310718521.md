Detectives are appealing for information after three rings were stolen from an elderly lady with Alzheimer's in Peterborough.

Between 11 March and 14 July the rings were stolen from the lady, who is in her 70s, at a property in Aldermans Drive.

Police are keen to speak to anyone who has been offered the rings for sale or who has information about what happened.

The rings are thought to be worth about Â£10,000 and have great sentimental value.

Detective Sergeant Rebecca Welberry said: "This is an absolutely despicable crime. To prey on a vulnerable lady suffering from dementia really is the lowest of the low.

"The victim's family are devastated this has happened to her and we're urging anyone with information to come forward."

Anyone with information regarding this incident should call police on 101 quoting 35/48183/20 or visit www.cambs.police.uk/report. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
