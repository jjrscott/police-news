Officers are appealing for information following a serious collision involving a motorbike and two cars near Waterbeach on Monday (28 September).

At just after 4pm, a red Yamaha motorcycle was travelling southbound on Clayhithe Road when it lost control and collided with a bronze Honda Civic and a green Volkswagen Polo on the opposite side of the road.

The driver of the motorcycle, a 16-year-old boy, was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge where he remains with serious but non-life-threatening injuries.

The drivers of the Honda and Volkswagen, both men, were not injured and stopped at the scene.

Police are now looking to speak to anyone who witnessed the collision or saw the motorcyclist just prior to it. They would particularly like to hear from two motorcyclists who were in the area at the time of the collision but did not stop at the scene.

Anyone with information, or dash cam footage, is urged to contact police via web chat or by calling 101, quoting incident number 279 of 28 September.
