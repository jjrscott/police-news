POLICE are urging members of the public to get in contact if they have been the victim of a fraudulent taxi driver.

There have been two reports of a man driving a black Skoda who has been waiting at the entrance to Peterborough City Hospital and posing as a taxi driver.

He has then hugely overcharged the vulnerable victims for their journeys and demanded payment.

PC Alex Boyle said: "This man is clearly targeting elderly people who have visited the hospital and are just looking to get home. If you have been a victim of this please come forward as it will help us build a picture of who he is and bring him to justice.

"If you can, use pre-paid taxis and make sure the car you are getting in is licensed correctly. If you are unsure ask a member of staff at the hospital who will help you get home."

Anyone with information should call police on 101 quoting 35/10945/20 or report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report.
