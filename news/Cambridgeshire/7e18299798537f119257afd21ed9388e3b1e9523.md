A man has been sentenced for his part in a brawl in the aftermath of a wake in Peterborough.

Peter Calvey, 49, had attended the wake at the Post Office Sports and Social Club in Bourges Boulevard on 27 April 2018 before things turned ugly.

At 1am the following day about six people were involved in violence outside the venue, with witnesses reporting punches being thrown and a chair being used to assault someone.

Officers attended the melee, where Calvey was identified as having assaulted another man.

At least six people received minor injuries as a result of the brawl.

Calvey, of Northfield, Tranent, East Lothian, admitted affray.

Yesterday (23 April) at Cambridge Crown Court he was sentenced to 14 months in prison, suspended for 18 months.

DC Paul Twell said: "Emotions were clearly running high following the day's events and a large amount of alcohol had reportedly been consumed, but these are not excuses for the violence which took place.

"It is only by luck that nobody was more seriously injured, this can also partly be attributed to officers arriving and dealing with what was a chaotic scene.

"There is no place for violence like this on the streets of Peterborough."
