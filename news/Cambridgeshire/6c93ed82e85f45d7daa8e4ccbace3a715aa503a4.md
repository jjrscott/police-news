A man who changed his car tyre at the side of the road while drunk has been disqualified.

A member of the public called police on the afternoon of 23 December when they spotted a 'wobbly' Kenneth Attfield changing a tyre on his red Ford Focus on Histon Road.

Officers arrived to find the 59-year-old, of Brockholme Mews, Great Cambourne, blocking a roundabout with his vehicle and asked him to provide a breath sample.

He was arrested after giving a reading of 124 microgrammes of alcohol in 100ml of breath - the legal limit being 35 microgrammes.

At Cambridge Magistrates' Court on Wednesday (3 March) Attfield was given a 12 month community order and disqualified from driving for 13 months after pleading guilty to being drunk in charge of a vehicle. He must also carry out 80 hours unpaid work and a rehabilitation activity requirement.

PC Vladimir Nikolic said: "Attfield was reported to be wobbly on his feet and had he not been stopped, he could've gone on to seriously hurt himself and other road users.

"Drink and drug driving are one of the fatal four causes of collisions on our roads."
