Three people who died in a collision on the Fletton Parkway at the weekend have been named.

Police were called to a collision involving two vehicles at the slip road to Stanground on the westbound carriageway just after midnight on Sunday (14 April).

Sister and brother Jana Kockova, 21, and Tomas Kocko 19, both of Hinchcliffe in Peterborough - along with Jana's fiance Marko Makula, 22, of Reeves Way in Peterborough, all suffered fatal injuries.
