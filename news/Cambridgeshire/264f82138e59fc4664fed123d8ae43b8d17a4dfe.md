Drugs, cash and assets worth an estimated Â£85,000 were seized by our north Community Action Team (CAT) yesterday morning (Thursday 4 June) following a drugs warrant.

The team forced entry to a property in Clayburn Road, Hampton Centre, at about 6.45am in connection with the supply of class A drugs.

A man and a woman, both 24, were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs, money laundering and possession of criminal property. The man was also arrested in connection with immigration offences.

The pair have since been charged with possession with intent to supply heroin, cocaine and crack cocaine.

They appeared at Peterborough Magistrates' Court today and have been remanded in custody to appear in court again on 3 July.

The man has also been charged with breaching a deportation order.
