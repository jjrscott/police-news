A burglar has been jailed following a break-in at a Peterborough home.

Robert Hooker, 49, got into a garage through an unlocked window at a property in Burford Way at about 3am on 16 May.

He took a brand new pressure washer and left by the same window but had been caught on CCTV.

He was arrested on 21 May after police identified him from the CCTV images. On arrest he was found with a suspected stolen laptop.

On Wednesday (17 July) at Peterborough Crown Court, Hooker, of St Michael's Gate, Peterborough pleaded guilty to burglary and handling stolen goods and was jailed for three years and six months.

DC Josh Mills said: "This case highlights the importance of home security and I would encourage everybody to ensure they keep windows and doors locked and secure when they are not present."
