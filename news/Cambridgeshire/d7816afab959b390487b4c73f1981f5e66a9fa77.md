Two men have been charged with drugs offences after officers in Cambridge stopped a vehicle they were travelling in at the weekend.

Officers were carrying out proactive patrols in Cambridge city centre just after 5pm on Saturday (21 April) when they noticed a Ford Focus they believed was being driven without insurance.

The vehicle was stopped at Tesco in Cheddars Lane, and two men inside the vehicle were searched.

The two men were arrested and have since been charged with possessing class A drugs with intent to supply.

Daniel Yemane, 30, of South Esk Road in London, and Zakariya Hilowloe, 21 of no fixed address, had their first hearing at Huntingdon Magistrates' Court yesterday.
