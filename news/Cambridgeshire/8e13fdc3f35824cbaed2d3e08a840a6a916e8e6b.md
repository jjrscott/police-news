Detectives have released a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to in connection with an assault in Cambridge.

An 18-year-old man was standing outside a takeaway in Regent Street in the early hours of 2 August when a group of men launched the attack.

The group punched and kicked the man multiple times, causing his teeth to crack and one to fall out, before fleeing.

Following the assault the victim was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital by officers.

DC Louisa Abbott, who is investigating, said: "This was a nasty and unprovoked assault which left a young man needing hospital treatment.

"We have been working on a number of lines of enquiry, but now we are appealing for the public's help.

"If you think you recognise the man pictured, please get in touch."

Anyone with information should contact police either by speaking to a web-chat operator on our website www.cambs.police.uk/report quoting 35/51344/20 or, if you do not have access to a computer, by calling 101.
