A man who attempted to hide a stash of class A drugs from police has been jailed.

David Goodman, 36, of Willow Walk, Cambridge was stopped by officers from the Neighbourhood Support Team (NST) on 12 November (2020) in Fair Street.

Suspecting he was selling drugs, they searched him and found Â£88 in cash, a mobile phone which was constantly ringing and an empty Kinder Egg packet.

Goodman was driven to custody for further searches but while in the vehicle he produced a bag containing 35 wraps of crack cocaine and heroin.

After previously pleading guilty to possession with intent to supply crack cocaine and heroin and breaching a suspended sentence, Goodman was today (20 January) sentenced to 28 months in prison at Peterborough Crown Court.

PC Luke Upcott from the NST said: "We can't be everywhere but we're working hard to ensure dealers like Goodman are arrested and put before the courts."
