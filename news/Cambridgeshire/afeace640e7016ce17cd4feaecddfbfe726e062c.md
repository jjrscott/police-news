A man is due in court today (Thursday) charged with producing class B drugs after police found a cannabis factory in Bretton.

The Neighbourhood Support Team carried out a warrant in Benland yesterday morning (Wednesday) where they discovered 122 cannabis plants worth up to about Â£102,000.

A 30-year-old man was arrested and has since been charged with producing cannabis and abstracting electricity.

He has been remanded in custody to appear at Cambridge Magistrates' Court today.

Anyone with information about drug dealing or production is urged to report it to us online.
