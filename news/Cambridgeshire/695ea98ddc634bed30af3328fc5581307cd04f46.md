Mathew's family said: "We, the family and friends are absolutely heart broken and distraught beyond belief at the loss of Mathew. We have lost the most amazing, cheeky, fun-loving young man anyone could ever wish to meet.

"The impact this has and will forever have on our lives is indescribable, Mathew will now never get to meet his unborn child."
