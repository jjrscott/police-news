A MAN who was found with thousands of indecent images of children on three separate devices has been sentenced.

Robert Norman, 36, had the images on his phone, laptop and a USB stick.

The images were found following a search on his home in Drybread Road, Whittlesey, on 7 September, 2017.

The devices were found to contain 7414 category C images, 127 category B and 69 category A (the most severe).

Norman, who is already a registered sex offender, pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent images of children and breach of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order.

Today (April 11) at Cambridge Crown Court he was sentenced to a three year community order, 60 days Rehabilitation Activity Requirement and five years on the SHPO to run concurrently with his existing order.

DC Jacqueline Bremner said: "Tackling the making and distribution of indecent images is a priority for police across the country and this sentence shows there are consequences for those who view such images."
