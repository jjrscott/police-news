A second man has been charged in connection with the murder of Dainius Kasiliauskis in Welland last week.

The 30-year-old was initially arrested on 13 June on suspicion of murder but was released on conditional bail.

He has since been charged with causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent and appeared at Huntingdon Magistrates' Court today (Saturday 20 June).

He has been remanded in custody to appear at Peterborough Crown Court on 17 July.

We were called at 9.42am on Friday 12 June to reports of a stabbing in Tilton Court.

Dainius Kasiliauskis, 27, of Buckminster Place, Welland, died at the scene.

A 19-year-old man was charged with murder on 14 June and is remanded in custody to appear at Cambridge Crown Court on 5 October.
