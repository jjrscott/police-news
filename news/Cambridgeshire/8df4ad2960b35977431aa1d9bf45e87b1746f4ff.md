A drug dealer who attempted to evade arrest must carry out 200 hours unpaid work.

Officers from the Southern neighbourhood support team were on patrol in Chesterton Road in November last year when 20-year-old Obabiyi Taiwo pulled out in front of them in his black BMW.

Taiwo made off from the officers while also allowing his passenger to flee the vehicle. He was stopped a short while later and found with more than Â£550 in cash, three mobile phones, cannabis, wraps and other drug paraphernalia.

Officers also searched his home in Kenilworth Avenue, Peterborough, and found two more mobile phones.

He pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply crack cocaine and heroin, possession of cannabis, failing to stop and possession of criminal property and at Cambridge Crown Court on Friday (12 March) he was sentenced to two years in prison, suspended for two years.

He must also carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and attend a 20 day Rehabilitation Activity Requirement.

PC Tom Carden from the team said: "We know that drug dealers will go to great lengths to evade police and conceal their activity but we too will go to great lengths to ensure they are arrested, charged and put before the courts."
