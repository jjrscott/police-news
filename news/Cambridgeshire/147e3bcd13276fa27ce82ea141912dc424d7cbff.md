We're appealing for witnesses after a stabbing in Peterborough yesterday (24 April) in which a man was taken to hospital.

The victim was cycling through Kirkmeadow, Bretton, just after 6pm when he was approached by a group of men.

The group, armed with weapons, then attacked the man.

The man was taken to Peterborough City Hospital with serious, but not life-threatening injuries.

Two teenagers - aged 16 and 17 and both from Peterborough - were arrested the same evening on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent.

Both remain in custody at Thorpe Wood Police Station in Peterborough.

An investigation has been launched and officers are appealing for witnesses to the incident, which is being treated as isolated.

DS Mike Paget said: "This was a nasty assault which left a man needing hospital treatment.

"The area is likely to have been fairly busy at the time and we're appealing for anyone who may have seen anything suspicious, no matter how small, to get in touch with us."

Anyone with information about the incident should contact us by calling 101, quoting crime reference number 35/28367/19, or report online atwww.cambs.police.uk/report.

Alternatively, they can report it anonymously by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555111 or visiting https://www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
