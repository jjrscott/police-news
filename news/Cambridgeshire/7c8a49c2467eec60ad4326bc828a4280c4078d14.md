A man from March who was caught with a knife in public has been sentenced.

Jack Banyard, 21, was with friends in Broad Street in the early hours of 12 September when he was stopped and searched by officers.

The search followed reports someone had been threatened in the area. Banyard handed a paring knife to officers and was arrested.

In interview he admitted possession of a knife in a public place and was charged.

On Wednesday (20 January) at Peterborough Crown Court, Banyard, of Russell Avenue, was sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for two years. He was also ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work, pay £425 costs and a £156 victim surcharge.

PC Tom Robinson said: "This case demonstrates how important stop and search powers are. I hope this experience causes Banyard to reflect on his actions and change his behaviour for the better.

"Carrying a knife is completely unacceptable and actually puts you at more risk of being seriously harmed.

"When a knife is involved arguments can escalate and easily result in someone being killed."
