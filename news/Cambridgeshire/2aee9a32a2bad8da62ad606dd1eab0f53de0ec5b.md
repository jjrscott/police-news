A disqualified driver who failed to stop for police before leading them on a 12-mile pursuit has been sentenced.

Martin Vasjanov, 24, was spotted speeding along the A1 northbound, near Southoe, on 9 September in a vehicle traffic officers also noticed was in poor condition.

They followed Vasjanov and witnessed him driving at 100mph in a 50mph zone.

He was pursued by officers and only stopped when surrounded by police vehicles on the B645 near to Hail Weston.

Once in custody, Vasjanov punched the roof of his cell causing significant damage.

Vasjanov, of Tattershall Road, Boston, Lincolnshire, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, driving while disqualified and criminal damage.

He was sentenced to 10 months in prison at Lincoln Crown Court today (25 October).

He was also handed an additional 10-month prison sentence, to be served consecutively, relating to a separate charge of dangerous driving in Lincolnshire. Bringing the total sentence to 20 months in prison.

Sergeant Mark Atkins, who investigated, said: "Vasjanov thought he could flout the rules of the road and get away with it, but he was wrong.

"He was already disqualified for a previous driving offence and put himself and other road users at serious risk by getting behind the wheel of that car and driving the way he did.

"I'm glad we have managed to take him off the road and hope this sends a strong message that we will take positive action against bad drivers."
