A man from Cambridge who smothered his wife to death has been sectioned indefinitely.

Muhammad Malik, 38, contacted police on 22 November 2016 saying he had attacked his wife. Police and paramedics attended the property in Perne Road and a woman was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital, but sadly died of her injuries.

A post mortem examination concluded the victim, Asia Tufail, 32, died of asphyxia at the hands of a third party. She was the mother of two young children.

On 7 April 2017 Malik pleaded guilty to manslaughter, on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Sentencing was postponed until psychological assessments were completed.

Today (22 May) at Cambridge Crown Court Malik was sectioned indefinitely under the Mental Health Act and will only be released if he can satisfy the mental health tribunal that he is well enough to be released into the community. He will only be released with a comprehensive care package and under the supervision of the community mental health team.

Detective Inspector Lucy Thomson said: "This was a tragic case where two young children lost their mother and our thoughts go out to all of Asia's family. We wish them well as they rebuild their lives.''
