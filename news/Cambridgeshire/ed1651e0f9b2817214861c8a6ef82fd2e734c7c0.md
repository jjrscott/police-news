A man has been arrested after a Boots store in Huntingdon was broken into in the early hours of this morning (Friday 6 November).

We were called at 2.06am with reports of the break-in at the chemist in Huntingdon High Street.

We attended and discovered entry had been gained to the front of the store by glass being smashed.

A 35-year-old man from Huntingdon was arrested this afternoon on suspicion of burglary and assaulting an emergency worker. He remains in custody at Thorpe Wood Police Station in Peterborough.

It is not known whether anything was stolen. Anyone with information is asked to contact police via the web-chat service here: https://bit.ly/2D9KFKH or by calling 101 and quoting crime reference 35/75449/20.
