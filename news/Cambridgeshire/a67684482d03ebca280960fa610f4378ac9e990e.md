A man who saw red after his friend told him he didn't have any cannabis has been handed a suspended sentence.

Eli Wright, 29, knocked on a friend's flat in Molewood Close, Cambridge, on 2 May.

When the victim answered, Wright asked him for cannabis but ripped off his door handle when he was told he didn't have any.

Seconds later he forced his way inside the flat, picking up a CCTV monitor and hard-drive and throwing them out a window.

Wright, of no fixed abode, jumped out of the window, smashed the hard-drive and walked off.

He was arrested two days later.

At Cambridge Crown Court today (16 July) he was sentenced to 18 months in prison, suspended for 24 months, after pleading guilty to burglary and criminal damage to property valued under Â£5,000.

He was also made the subject of an indefinite restraining order against three occupants who were in the home at the time.

DC Victoria Norden, who investigated, said: "Drugs can have a devastating impact on lives and in this case, caused Wright to snap and see red."
