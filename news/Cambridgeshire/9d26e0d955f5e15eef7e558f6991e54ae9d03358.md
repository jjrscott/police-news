Two people who died following a collision last Thursday (15 August) have been named.

Roy Grainger, 72, and his wife Michele, 73, both of High Road, Wisbech, were travelling along the A47 in their black Vauxhall Astra when they were involved in a head-on collision with an HGV.

Their family have asked for their privacy to be respected, but have released this statement:

"Roy and Michele were devoted parents and grandparents.

"Roy moved to London from North Wales to become a police officer and following his retirement he became involved in the Rotary Club and a season ticket holder at his beloved Everton FC.

"Michele was a nurse and met Roy in London. She was involved in the local church, choir and the Women's Institute.

"They will be greatly missed by all."

We are still appealing for information about the collision and are asking anyone who has dash-cam footage of the collision or information about the incident to call police on 101 quoting Op Stanage or report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report.
