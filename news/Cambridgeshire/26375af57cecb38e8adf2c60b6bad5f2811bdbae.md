A woman who stole more than £11,000 from her employer in three years has been sentenced.

Stephanie Newman, 40, had been working for her employer in Soham for two years when she was put in charge of payroll in 2016.

In October 2019, bosses at the company discovered she had overpaid herself by £11,470 in three years.

When questioned by officers, Newman said she never wanted to work in payroll and the overpayments were a mistake. She claimed she had told the management team about the mistake but nothing was done about it so she continued to take the money.

Newman, of Mereside, Soham, later pleaded guilty to theft and was sentenced to 12 months in prison, suspended for two years at Cambridge Crown Court on Tuesday (29 September). She was also ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and repay the money she had stolen as compensation.

PC Simon Rampley, who investigated, said: "Regardless of whether the payments were a mistake or deliberate, Newman knew she had received overpayments and should not have taken them.

"She was put in a position of trust and responsibility and clearly abused this."
