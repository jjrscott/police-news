We have released CCTV images of a man we would like to speak to in connection with a number of thefts in Cambridge.

On 5 March charity collection tins were taken from the bar of a pub on Norfolk Street and a hotel in Trumpington Street.

On 7 March money was taken from a church on Hills Road.

Officers are keen to identify those responsible and urge anyone who may recognise this man to pass on information by calling 101 and quoting 35/17623/20, alternatively you can report online.
