Police have released CCTV images of two men they want to speak to in connection with a theft in Peterborough.

Two men entered Aldi, Hampton Centre, last Thursday (13 August) where they approached a 73-year-old woman. One of the men distracted her while the other stole her purse from her handbag.

Crime Reduction Officer, Helen O'Driscoll said: "We would urge members of the public to look at these images and contact police if they recognise either man or have any information.

"Crowded places like supermarkets often attract pickpockets because it is easier for them to steal your personal items without you knowing.

"Don't give thieves the opportunity. Help yourself avoid becoming a victim of pickpocketing by following our advice."

We encourage you to:

 * use a bag that can be closed properly so that it's difficult for someone to open it and reach in
 * wear bags across your body rather than over your shoulder where possible
 * consider using a lanyard which attaches your phone or purse/wallet to your bag or clothes
 * keep your purse or wallet at the bottom of your bag
 * avoid putting valuables such as phones, wallets or purses in your back pocket
 * do not leave bags unattended in (or hanging on) shopping trollies as they are an easy target when you are distracted

Anyone with any information should contact us via our web-chat or by calling 101 quoting incident number 35/54519/20.
