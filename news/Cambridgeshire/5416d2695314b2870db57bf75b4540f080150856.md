Small businesses are being encouraged to register for a free event which will offer advice around cyber security.

Working in partnership with the Eastern Region Special Operations Unit (ERSOU), Cambridgeshire Constabulary is holding an evening session in St Neots for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

The event will run between 6pm and 8pm on Tuesday, 14 November, at the St Neots Library in Priory Lane.

Phillipa Phipps, from the Regional Cyber Crime Unit, said: "Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) account for 99.9 percent of the UK's private sector businesses and there is around a 50 percent chance of an SME experiencing a cyber security breach.

"We're encouraging people to come along to our free event to learn how you can defend your business. Included in the evening are speakers from local law enforcement, the Regional Cyber Trust Group (RCTG) and industry, with an interactive panel discussion giving you the chance to ask any questions you may have.

"There will be plenty of networking opportunities with refreshments provided and delegates can opt to book a free 'Cyber Basics Review' to help you identify if your business is vulnerable."

Those wishing to attend should register by visiting www.eventbrite.co.uk and search 'Cyber Security for SMEs'.
