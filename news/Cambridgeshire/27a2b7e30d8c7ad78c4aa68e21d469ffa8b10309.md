Police are urging members of the public to get in contact if they have been the victims of fraud, or attempted fraud, in Peterborough.

Over the last few months reports have been made about a man approaching members of the public at their home addresses and requesting money.

The suspect usually says that he needs money for an electric card and that his wife is in London or in hospital.

Victims have mostly been elderly and on occasions the suspect has followed victims inside their home until money is handed over.

PC Matt Lauch said: "This man is clearly targeting people and we want to put an end to this. I am urging anyone who has been a victim of this crime, or thinks they were targeted by this person, to get in contact with us.

"Even if no money was handed over the information will be invaluable to our investigation."

Anyone with information should call police on 101 quoting Op Anlaby or report online at _www.cambs.police.uk/report_.
