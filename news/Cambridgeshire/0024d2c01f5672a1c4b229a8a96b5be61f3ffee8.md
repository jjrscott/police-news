A jury has found a pensioner guilty of 18 sexual offences against four girls.

Sazzad Miah, 83, was arrested in October last year (2017) after police received information about the historical abuse which had taken place over 23 years.

The court heard how he abused one girl over a period of 12 years between 1992 and 2004, another over eight years between 2004 and 2012, when two were as young as four, another five-years-old and the other 10.

Miah, of Jermyn Close in Cambridge, denied any wrongdoing, however yesterday (Tuesday, 12 June), following a 16-day trial at Cambridge Crown Court, he was found guilty of five counts indecent assault, two counts of indecency with a child, four counts of rape, two counts of rape of a child under 13, four counts of sexual assault of a child under 13 and one count of sexual activity with a child.
