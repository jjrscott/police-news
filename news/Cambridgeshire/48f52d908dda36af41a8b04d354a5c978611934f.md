We have released CCTV images of a man we want to speak with in connection with the theft of a mobile phone in Bretton.

The victim, a 12-year-old boy, was using the self-service checkouts in Sainsbury's supermarket in Bretton Centre at about 6.15pm on Friday, 6 September, when he left his phone behind.

He returned to the store a short while later once he'd realised he had left his phone at the checkout, to find it had gone.

We would like to speak with the man in the CCTV images in connection with the theft.

Anyone with information is asked to report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report quoting 35/64253/19 or call 101.
