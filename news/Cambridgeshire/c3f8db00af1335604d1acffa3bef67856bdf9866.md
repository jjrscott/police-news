Officers will be holding regular surgeries at Ely Police Station.

Each Monday (starting 20 January) the doors of the station in Nutholt Lane will be open to the public between 12pm and 5pm.

Members of the public are invited to go along and discuss any policing issues that may be affecting them as an individual or as a community.

Sergeant Mark Rabel said: "We want to offer our communities an opportunity to come and speak to us, face-to-face on a regular basis. We look forward to seeing you at the station and making a difference together."

The enquiry office at the station is temporarily closed due to staff sickness but officers are still working from the station and appointments are being taken.

There is a yellow phone available outside or members of the public can report crime by calling 101 or via our website or take part in a webchat.
