A closure notice has been served on a house in Wisbech following ongoing reports of anti-social behaviour (ASB).

The notice was issued to 2 Oil Mill Lane by the Wisbech Neighbourhood Policing Team yesterday afternoon (Monday 24 August) as a result of numerous reports of ASB including excessive noise, violence, drunk and disorderly behaviour and criminal damage.

An application was made from police to Peterborough Magistrates' Court yesterday for the notice to be in place for the next 48 hours.

The notice states the premises is subject to a closure notice as there are reasonable grounds for believing 'use of the premises has resulted or is likely to result in nuisance to members of the public from excessive noise, acts of violence, drunk or disorderly behaviour, criminal damage and behaviour that would cause a reasonable person alarm and distress' or 'that there has been or is likely soon to be disorder near the premises associated with the use of those premises'.

For the next 48 hours, the notice prohibits any person from entering the premises other than those who live there.

Failure to comply with the order is a criminal offence which could result in imprisonment for up to three months, a fine, or both.

An application will be made to Peterborough Magistrates' Court tomorrow (26 August) for a full closure order to be granted, which will prohibit access to the property by anyone other than the residents for a period of up to three months.
