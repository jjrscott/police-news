A man who punched, bit and spat at three police officers has been sentenced.

Officers were dispatched to Market Square in Huntingdon on 3 April in response to calls from members of the public that Steven Clegg was causing a nuisance to shop staff and passers-by.

When two officers arrived, the 33-year-old started to shout abuse before biting one and punching another during his arrest.

He then spat at a third officer who arrived to assist.

Clegg, of no fixed abode previously pleaded guilty to two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and assault by beating of an emergency worker.

Today (29 April) he was sentenced to 16 months at Peterborough Crown Court.

Detective Constable Louise Trippett said: "Assaults on emergency workers who are here to keep the people of Cambridgeshire safe are unacceptable."
