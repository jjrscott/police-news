A man has been jailed for eight weeks after making off from officers while under arrest.

Andrew Dunkley, 32, was arrested outside his flat in Rachel Close, Cambridge, in the early hours of 25 March.

As he was being taken to the back of a police van Dunkley pulled away from the escorting officer before running off through a hedgerow.

He was circulated as wanted after attempts to trace him were unsuccessful.

He was found the following day in a car on the A10 in Littleport.

Dunkley was sentenced at Cambridge Crown Court yesterday (11 May) after admitting escaping lawful custody.

DC Lisa Bacon, who investigated, said: "Dunkley thought he was in the clear after getting away from us.

"He actually made things a lot worse for himself as he was never convicted of the offences he was originally arrested on suspicion of."
