Officers have released an image of a rare motorcycle stolen from a home in Gamlingay on Wednesday.

Burglars broke into a home in Potton Road between 11am and 12.15pm.

The stolen bike is a 1950s Manx-Norton ES2 motorcycle.

The bike, reportedly worth more than Â£12,000, is designed specifically for racing and therefore not registered with the DVLA.

Detective Constable Martin Hardy said: "This is a very distinctive motorbike that is unlikely to be scrapped or sold in parts due to its high value.

"I would urge anyone with any information about the bike to call police."

Anyone with any information should call DC Hardy on 101 or report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or visit www.crimestoppers-uk.org
