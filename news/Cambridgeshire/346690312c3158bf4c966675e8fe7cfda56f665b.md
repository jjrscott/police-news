We are appealing for information after the driver of a Renault Clio failed to stop for police.

At about 12.55pm yesterday afternoon (Monday), the driver of a grey Renault Clio was directed to stop by road policing officers in Lincoln Road, but failed to do so.

After a short pursuit a 24-year-old man from Peterborough was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and failing to stop for police. He was later released under investigation.

We are appealing for any witnesses to get in touch, or for any dash-cam footage to be passed on. Those with information are asked to contact us by calling 101 and quoting incident 211 of 17 December.
