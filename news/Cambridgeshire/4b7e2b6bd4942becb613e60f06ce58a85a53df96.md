A man who burgled a Cambridge show home has been jailed for more than two years.

Jamie Jeffrey, 28, of Essex Road, Cambridge broke into the building site in Coldhams Lane in September 2018 and filled a van with goods worth around Â£20,000.

Among the items taken were laptops, drills, tiles, a coffee table, cushions, mattresses, garden furniture, a bar of soap, TV, coffee machine and lamps.

Officers investigating the crime found a discarded straw and cup lid which linked Jeffrey to the scene through his DNA.

He was found guilty at a trial last month and at Cambridge Crown Court on Thursday (19 November) was sentenced to two years in prison plus an additional four months for activating a suspended sentence from August 2018

PC Matt Phillips said: "Jeffrey broke into the site and raided the sales office, show home and onsite containers taking the most valuable items.

"Thanks to a thorough investigation, we were able to link him to the scene and he is now serving a lengthy prison sentence."
