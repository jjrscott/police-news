A man who raped a young girl he should have been looking after has been jailed for 17 years.

Jacob Heranwa, 49, of Bernard Close, Huntingdon abused his position of trust by raping her three times.

Heranwa denied three counts of rape of a child under 13 but was found guilty following a four day trial at Peterborough Crown Court.

He was sentenced on Thursday (18 January) to 17 years on each count, to run concurrently, and told he would serve an eight year extended license on release.

He received an indefinite restraining order preventing contact with the family and was also made the subject of an indefinite Sexual Harm Prevention Order.

DC Ruth Craig, who investigated, said the victim and her family had been incredibly brave.

She said: "Heranwa abused a vulnerable girl in his care, exploiting a position of trust. The victim should have been safe and yet he used the opportunity to commit serious offences against her.

"He has not shown a shred of remorse for his actions, instead trying to apportion blame on the victim, and the sentence reflects that.

"Anyone who has concerns about child abuse should contact Cambridgeshire Police, Children's Social Care or the NSPCC"
