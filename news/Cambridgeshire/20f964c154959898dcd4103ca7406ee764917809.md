A MAN who threatened things were going to "get messy" while brandishing a machete has been jailed.

Trevor Harris, of Oxclose, Bretton approached a member of the public on 13 February, 2019 holding the machete.

The 48 year old, said he was looking for a black man who owed him money.

He left the area before police arrived but was subsequently arrested two days later.

Harris pleaded guilty to possession of a blade in a public place at Peterborough Crown Court on tuesday, (19 March) and was sentenced to 16 months in jail.

Sergeant Steve Ashton said: "Harris was a risk to all in the area that day and I'm pleased we were able to find him so quickly.

"This sentencing demonstrates that you don't have to use a weapon for it to be a serious criminal offence."
