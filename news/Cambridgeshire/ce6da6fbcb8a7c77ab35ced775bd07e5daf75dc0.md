Detectives are appealing for witnesses to an affray in Peterborough following the death of a man believed to be involved in the incident.

Glenn Boocock, of Lincoln Road, Peterborough, was found dead at his home last Tuesday (18 June) after he failed to arrive at work.

The 37 year old suffered a head injury on 6 June after being involved in the affray outside O'Neills pub, in Broadway, Peterborough.

The head injury was not reported and Mr Boocock attended hospital that morning but discharged himself before all checks had been completed.

Mr Boocock, an electrician, then visited hospital on another occasion before also attending a walk-in clinic.

A post-mortem at Peterborough City Hospital on Thursday (20 June) determined Mr Boocock died as a result of a traumatic head injury.

DI Emma Pitts, from the Beds, Cambs and Herts Major Crime Unit (MCU) said the death was being treated as suspicious and an investigation has now been launched.

She said: "We are piecing together the circumstances surrounding the incident on 6 June which Mr Boocock was involved in.

"We know there were people in the area around the time Mr Boocock suffered the head injury on 6 June, and I would appeal to them to come forward.

"We are particularly keen for anyone who may have dash cam or mobile phone footage from the area around that time to get in touch.

"Anyone with information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, should not hesitate to contact police."

Anyone with information should call police on 101 quoting incident 106 of 18 June. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
