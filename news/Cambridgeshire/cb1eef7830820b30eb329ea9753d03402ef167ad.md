Officers are appealing for information following a serious single-vehicle collision in Benwick Road (B1093), Doddington.

Just before midday on Friday (10 July), a grey Vauxhall Corsa was travelling westbound when it left the carriageway.

The driver, a 79-year-old man, suffered serious head injuries and was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital, where he remains in a serious condition.

Police are appealing for anyone who witnessed the collision, saw the vehicle beforehand or who has dashcam footage from the area to call 101 quoting Op Keenan, or report online at: www.cambs.police.uk/report.
