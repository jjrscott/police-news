A driver failed a roadside breath test following a crash and then refused to provide a blood sample because the doctor was not British.

Peter Sharp, 42, was driving a black Jaguar XJ without a valid licence on 17 January when he was involved in a collision with another vehicle, causing both cars to leave the road.

Sharp failed a roadside breath test with a reading of 120 microgrammes - more than three times the legal limit.

He was taken to hospital following the collision, where he refused to provide a blood sample because the doctor was American.

Sharp, of Ferndown Drive, Godmanchester, admitted failing to provide a specimen for analysis, driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence, without insurance or a valid MOT certificate for the vehicle.

Yesterday (24 September) at Peterborough Crown Court Sharp was sentenced to six months in prison.

PC Ritchie Ashmead said: "There were no medical grounds for Sharp refusing to provide a blood sample at hospital. The discrimination he showed towards the doctor based on their nationality was totally unacceptable.

"Drink driving significantly increases your chances of being involved in a serious or even fatal collision. It puts both your life and that of other innocent road users at risk."
