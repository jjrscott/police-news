Officers are appealing for witnesses following a single-vehicle collision on the A47, Thorney, on Friday.

At about 6.24pm, a black Range Rover Vogue hit a roundabout and landed on the other side of the junction, about 25 feet away.

Emergency services attended and the driver of the vehicle was taken to hospital with serious injuries. The driver then refused to provide a specimen.

Anyone with dashcam footage of the collision, or who saw the Range Rover driving prior to the collision, is urged to call police on 101 quoting ref: 402 of 21 February.
