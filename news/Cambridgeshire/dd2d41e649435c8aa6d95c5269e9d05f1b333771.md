On four occasions the Stagecoach buses have been in the Thorpe Park Road and Mayors Walk areas and once in Bretton. Details below:

 * Saturday 7 November - 1.15pm in Mayors Walk/Thorpe Park Road
 * Saturday 7 November - 7pm in Heltwate, Bretton

 * Tuesday 10 November - 7.30pm in Mayors Walk/Thorpe Park Road
 * Thursday 12 November - 6pm in Mayors Walk/Thorpe Park Road

PC Nik Loizou said: "Objects have been aimed at the buses causing windows to smash. Thankfully there have been no injuries reported, however this is extremely dangerous and could cause a collision or serious injury."
