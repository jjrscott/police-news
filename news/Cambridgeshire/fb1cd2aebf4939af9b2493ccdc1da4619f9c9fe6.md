Four people have been arrested after three drug warrants were carried out in Peterborough this morning (Thursday).

Officers from across the force, including detectives, neighbourhood teams, dog unit and specially trained search officers visited three properties in Fengate and the city centre.

As a result, two women aged 22 and 24, and two men aged 28 and 60, have been arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs and money laundering and are in custody at Thorpe Wood Police Station.

Searches of the properties in Hartley Way, First Drove and Viersen Platz are ongoing, however drugs, cash and mobile phones have been seized, along with suspected stolen car parts.

Anyone with concerns about drug dealing can pass information on to us online.
