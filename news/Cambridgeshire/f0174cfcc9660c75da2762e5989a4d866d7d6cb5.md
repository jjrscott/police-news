Officers are appealing for the public's help in identifying a man they would like to speak to in connection with a burglary in Cambridge.

At about 10pm on Monday, 4 June a silver Citroen Berlingo was stolen in Great Northern Road after a man entered a flat through an unlocked door and took the keys.

Officers are keen to identify the man in the CCTV image and urge anyone who may know who he is to pass on information by reporting online at www.cambs.police.uk/report and quote 35/3521/18, or you can call 101.
