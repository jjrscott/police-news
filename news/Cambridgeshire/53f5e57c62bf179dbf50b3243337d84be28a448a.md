A Cambridge cannabis grower has been sent to prison thanks to information from local residents.

Acting on information from members of the public, officers from the Southern Neighbourhood Support Team carried out a warrant at a property in Wagstaff Close on 19 February.

Inside they found 35-year-old Albion Kurti and 161 cannabis plants with a street value of up to Â£135,000.

Yesterday (23 March), Kurti was sentenced to a year and 10 months in prison after previously pleading guilty to production of cannabis.

PC Rachel Burnett said: "Thanks to intelligence received from members of the public, we were able to shut down this cannabis factory. We can't be everywhere and we rely on people in our communities being our eyes and ears. If you suspect something isn't right, it more than likely isn't."

We would encourage people to look out for signs of illegal cannabis factories including blacked out windows and people coming and going at various times of the day. Those living next door may also notice a distinctive 'hum' noise from the fans and ventilation.
