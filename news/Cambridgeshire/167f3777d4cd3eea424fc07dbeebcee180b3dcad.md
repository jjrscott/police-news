A man who spat in a police officer's face during the Covid-19 pandemic and racially abused him has been sentenced.

Ibraheem Tanveer, 21, of Cromwell Road, Peterborough, was arrested by officers in the early hours of 15 April for an offence which he later faced no further action.

However, during this arrest Tanveer became uncooperative which led the officers at the scene to call for further assistance.

Two other officers attended, but Tanveer refused to be compliant and became verbally abusive. As the officers attempted to escort Tanveer to the police van, he spat at one of the them with the spit landing in their face.

Once outside, Tanveer asked for his inhaler for his asthma and officers went to search for this in his home.

Before he was given his inhaler however, Tanveer made a racial slur to the same officer he had spat at. He was then further arrested for assaulting an emergency worker and racially aggravated harassment.

In police interview, Tanveer admitted spitting in the officer's face and stated he wasn't happy with the way he had been treated. He said he was still drunk and high on cannabis so "lost it" and spat at the officer.

Tanveer accepted this was wrong, but claimed he didn't realise spitting at someone was assault.

He also accepted making a racial slur at the officer but said he "didn't mean it in the way it sounds" and was "just angry and kicking off".

Tanveer was later served a postal requisition charging him with assaulting an emergency worker, racially aggravated harassment and using threatening words or behaviour. He pleaded guilty to all three charges at a previous hearing at Cambridge Magistrates' Court.

### "Such an unhygienic act is abhorrent"

In a victim impact statement, Chief Constable Nick Dean said: "I am appalled by this behaviour towards the officers and in the current climate facing Covid-19, such an unhygienic act is abhorrent.

"The potential anxiety and stress caused by unsanitary actions such as this cannot be underestimated. This is a serious concern, not only for the officers and their colleagues but their immediate family."

Tanveer was sentenced at Peterborough Crown Court on Friday (23 October) where he was handed four months in prison.

DC Jenny Blunt, who investigated, said: "The actions Tanveer showed towards his arresting officers were completely unacceptable.

"Being subjected to abuse while simply doing your job will not be tolerated and we will continue to take strong action against all forms of abuse. I hope this sentence gives Tanveer the chance to think about and change his behaviour."
