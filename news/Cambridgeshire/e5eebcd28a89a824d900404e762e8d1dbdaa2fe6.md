We are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an aggravated burglary in Peterborough last night (Thursday).

The 25-year-old victim was expecting a takeaway delivery at his home in Midland Road, West Town, at about 7pm when the incident happened.

A man claiming to be a delivery driver attacked the victim in his hallway but ran off down Midland Road in the direction of Thorpe Road.

The offender is described as black, 5' 3", aged between 20 and 30 and slim build. He was wearing a black balaclava and had a hood up over his head.

Detective Sergeant Richard Ellison said: "I am particularly keen to hear from people who were in the area around the time of the offence, including anyone who may have dash-cam footage - we believe a taxi was parked up nearby and also a woman was on the footpath."

Anyone with information is urged to report online or use our online webchat function and quote crime reference 35/9778/21. Those without access to the internet should call 101.
