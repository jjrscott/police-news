A man who was caught growing almost Â£400,000 worth of cannabis in his home has been jailed.

Ilir Aga, 37, filled his four bedroom house in Fordham Road, Newmarket, with cannabis plants and was operating a "sophisticated operation."

However, officers conducted a drugs warrant on 25 April and found the haul filling every bedroom and two outbuildings.

He pleaded guilty to producing a class B drug at Cambridge Crown Court last Thursday (12 December) and was sentenced to a year in prison.

PC Alan Tregilgas said: "This was a sophisticated operation that would have put a lot of cannabis on the streets. I am pleased we have managed to disrupt this and that Aga has been jailed.

"I hope this sends a clear message that we will work hard to find and destroy cannabis farms and put the people behind them before the courts."
