Two men have been arrested after a man was stabbed in the early hours of this morning.

At around 12.30am the victim, a man in his 20s, called police to report that he had been stabbed outside his home in Wicken.

The man was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital with serious, but not life threatening injuries.

A man in his 50s was arrested under suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder and a second man in his 50s was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.

Both remain in custody at Parkside Police Station and officers investigating are treating this as an isolated incident.
