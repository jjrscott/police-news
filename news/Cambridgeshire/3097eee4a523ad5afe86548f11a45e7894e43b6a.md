A man has been convicted of breaching a court order by helping to coach a children's football team in Peterborough.

Stephen Graham, 53, volunteered to help with the training of the under eights team in February.

On 27 February, police were notified of his actions and he was arrested three days later. When officers searched his home they found three smart phones.

Graham, of King Street, Wisbech, admitted two counts of breaching a Sexual Offences Prevention Order.

Yesterday (10 December) at Cambridge Crown Court he was sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for 18 months. He was also given a 25 day rehabilitation action requirement.
