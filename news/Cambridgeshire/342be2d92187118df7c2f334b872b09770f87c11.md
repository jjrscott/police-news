Police are appealing for information following a serious single-vehicle collision in March on Saturday (17 October).

Officers were called to the B1101, Wimblington Road, at just before 9.50pm with reports a green Proton Savvy had left the road and collided with a tree.

Two passengers, women aged 19 and 20, were taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge where they remain with serious but non-life-threatening injuries.

A third passenger, a 20-year-old woman, suffered minor injuries.

A 29-year-old woman from March was arrested at the scene on suspicion of drink driving and was subsequently released under investigation.

Officers would now like to hear from anyone who was in the area and witnessed the collision or has dashcam footage from the area.

They would particularly like to hear from the driver of a light coloured BMW or Mercedes who was seen in the area at the time of the collision but did not stop. Officers believe the driver may be able to assist them with their inquiries.

Anyone with information is urged to call 101 quoting incident 484 of 17 October, or visit www.cambs.police.uk/report
