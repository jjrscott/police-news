We have released images of suspected stolen items that were recovered from several properties across Cambridgeshire and Norfolk.

The items were found in December and January as part of investigations into burglaries in the areas.

We want to find the rightful owners so they can be returned.

Anyone who believes an item is theirs, and can prove ownership, should call us on 101 quoting Op Hawkesbury.

The images can be found on Facebook in the album - Recovered property - Op Hawkesbury.
