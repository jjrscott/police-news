We have released CCTV of a man we would like to speak to in connection with a burglary in Cambridge.

A blue Audi S3 was stolen in Tavistock Road at about 6.10pm last Thursday (20 December) after a house was broken into and the vehicle keys were stolen.

Officers are keen to identify the man in the CCTV image and urge anyone who may know who he is to pass on information by reporting online at www.cambs.police.uk/report and quote 35/53680/18, or you can call 101.

Do you recognise this man?
