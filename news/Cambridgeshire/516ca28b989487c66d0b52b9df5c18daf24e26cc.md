We are appealing for witnesses to a collision on the A1307 at Linton on Friday evening (13 July) where sadly a man sustained fatal injuries.

At about 9.15pm a black Volkswagen Passat and a blue Audi A3 collided outside Dalehead Foods in Cambridge Road.

Mitica Baiculescu, 50, of London Road in Ipswich was a passenger in the Volkswagen and died at the scene.

The drivers of both vehicles and three passengers in the Volkswagen sustained serious injuries and were taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge where one person remains.

PC John Blood, from the Forensic Collision Investigation Unit (FCIU), said: "I would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision or either of the vehicles in the moments leading up to it.

"It happened around the time of a shift changeover at Dalehead Foods therefore there were a number of cars leaving the site around the time of the collision. I am particularly keen to hear from any employees who were leaving or arriving at the site around this time."

Anyone with information is asked to contact the road policing unit by either reporting information online at www.cambs.police.uk/report and quoting incident 495 of 13 July, or call 101.
