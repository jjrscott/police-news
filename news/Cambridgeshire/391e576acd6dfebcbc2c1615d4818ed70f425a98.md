They say as a police officer you're never off duty, and for Superintendent Jon Hutchinson from Cambridgeshire police, that rings very true.

Supt Hutchinson enjoys going out for a jog around Cambridge and yesterday was no exception. As he made his way along De Freville Avenue, he recognised a man he had seen on a police database and knew to be a burglary suspect from Liverpool.

After a stop and search of the 44-year-old man he was arrested.

It just goes to show that knowledge and patrolling (or jogging) with a purpose gets results.

Supt Hutchinson said: "This is the second time I have caught a suspect while out jogging, it's becoming a bit of a habit.

"I'm just glad to be able to do my bit in helping my officers tackle crime in Cambridge."
