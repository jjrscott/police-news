A call from a concerned member of the public in the early hours of this morning (Monday 8 February) has resulted in two men being arrested.

We received the call at 3.40am stating two men were trying to break into cars in a car park in Stagsden, Orton Goldhay.

Police Dog Hunter and his handler located two men aged 36 and 48 nearby and held them there until colleagues arrived to detain and search the pair.

A knife, claw hammer, knuckleduster and an imitation firearm were found on the men who were arrested on suspicion of possession of weapons and going equipped for theft. They remain in custody at Thorpe Wood Police Station.
