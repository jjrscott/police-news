Police in Cambridge are keen to reunite five suspected stolen bikes with their rightful owners.

The bikes have been recovered in the past two weeks as part of an ongoing crackdown on cycle theft in the city.

Officers have checked them against existing reports of bike theft but have been unable to identify any owners.

If your bike is missing, you haven't reported it stole and you believe one of these to be yours, please email cbcitycentre@cambs.pnn.police.uk. You will need to be able to provide some proof of ownership.
