Members of the public are being asking to report information following a robbery in Orton Malborne last night (Monday 7 December).

The 26-year-old victim was walking towards the Engaine area of Orton Longueville at about 8.30pm after having drawn out cash from an ATM at the Herlington Centre in Orton Malborne.

Three men, who the victim believes he saw near the cash machine, came up behind him and knocked him to the ground, continuing to punch and kick him before making off with his phone, EarPods and Â£160 in cash.

The offenders are all described as between 18 to 20, white and wore dark clothing with scarves covering their faces.

Anyone with information about the incident is urged to contact us online either at www.cambs.police.uk/report, or using the online web chat function and quoting incident 477 of 7 December. Those who do not have access to the internet should call 101.
