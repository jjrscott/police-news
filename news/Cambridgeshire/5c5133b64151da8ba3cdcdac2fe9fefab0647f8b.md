A man who robbed six convenience stores across the county at knifepoint has been jailed for 15 years.

Robert Walker, 38, of Wesleyan Road, Peterborough, was handed the sentence at Cambridge Crown Court yesterday (September 4) after previously being found guilty of six counts of robbery.

The court heard how Walker and an unknown accomplice, armed with knives, crowbars and screwdrivers, conducted a series of robberies to steal more than £5,000 in cash, alcohol and cigarettes.

The spate of attacks began on November 6 last year (2016) when wearing gloves, a hooded top and white mask he entered a One Stop shop in High Street, Buckden.

Staff were threatened with the knives and the tools were used to wedge open the tills. Walker made off with about £700 and alcohol.

Walker used the same tactics and struck again on November 10 at the Co-op in High Street, Longstanton. He left with between £400 and £800 and cigarettes.

On November 15 he robbed £1,400 and alcohol from the Co-op in High Street, Brampton and on November 30 took a further £1,800 from Tesco in Great North Road, Eaton Socon.

The final two attacks took place on December 3 at the Co-op store in Glatton Road, Sawtry and on December 6 at Dogsthorpe Post Office in Bluebell Avenue, Peterborough when he got away with more than £630.

Walker was arrested on December 9 after DNA evidence from a screwdriver left at the Co-op in Brampton linked him to the scene. Mobile phone data also linked him to the scene of each robbery at the time it was taking place.

Detective Constable Karin Peters said: "These robberies deeply affected the staff working at the time and in some cases they are still experiencing the effects of those nights.

"There were also many customers who had to witness the events and who were threatened by Walker. The sentence reflects the seriousness of Walker's actions."

Walker was sentenced to 15 years for each count, to be served concurrently.
