A man has been arrested following the execution of a warrant by Peterborough's Community Action Team (CAT) this morning (Tuesday).

A 35-year-old man, of no fixed address, was arrested in Star Road on suspicion of possession of class A and B drugs and handling stolen goods.

Sergeant Jason Hancock, from the CAT, said: "This warrant today came about because of intelligence received from members of the public which we would like to thank them for.

"This is a really positive result and hopefully we can reunite the stolen goods with their owners."
