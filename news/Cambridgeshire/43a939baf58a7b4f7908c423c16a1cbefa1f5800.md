Police are appealing for witnesses after lead, copper and tin was stolen from a church roof.

The materials were stolen from St John the Baptist Church on Church Street, Peterborough, between 10.30am on 29 December and 8am on 27 January.

DC Tom Nuttall said: "This type of crime is not victimless and we treat it extremely seriously due to the devastation it can have on churches and the local communities.

"We are committed to catching those responsible for heritage crimes, including lead thefts.

"It's important that members of the public keep their eyes open to any suspicious behaviour, particularly around isolated locations at night.

"If anyone saw anything suspicious around St John the Baptist Church during the above timeframe then I'd urge them to get in touch."

Anyone with any information should call police on 101, quoting crime reference number 35/6666/20. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
