A dispersal order covering Cherry Hinton Lakes has today (29 May) been put in place in a bid to reduce crime and disorder.

The order was approved after a number of people were reported to police for trespassing and swimming in the lakes over the past two days.

Since April a total of 25 incidents have been reported to police, who will now have the power to move people on if they suspect their behaviour is anti-social until Sunday afternoon (31 May).

Failure to comply with the order can result in arrest.

The area covered by the order is bordered by Snakey Path, Burnside, the Tins Path, the railway line to the east, Harcombe Road, Doggett Road, and Daws Lane.

Inspector Martin Townsend, who approved the order, said: "Over recent weeks we have noticed an increased amount of trespassing and swimming at the lakes.

"While I understand the weather is hot I would like to remind the public of the dangers of swimming in open water, which can often have hazards hidden underneath the surface or be colder than expected."
