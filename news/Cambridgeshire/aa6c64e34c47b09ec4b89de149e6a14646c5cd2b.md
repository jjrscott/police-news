A London drug dealer who was caught with more than £2000 worth of drugs and cash has been jailed for two-and-a-half years.

Karim Habashi, 20, was reported to police after he was seen dealing drugs in Norfolk Street, Cambridge on Sunday, 21 May.

He was arrested at about 11pm when officers found a small amount of cannabis and more than £700 cash on him.

A further search at Parkside Police Station revealed he had been hiding £440 worth of heroin and £910 worth of crack cocaine in his underpants.

Habashi, of Bernhard Crescent, north London, appeared at Cambridge Crown Court yesterday (22 August) after pleading guilty to two counts of possession of a class A drug with intent to supply.

He was sentenced two years and six months on both counts, to be served concurrently. He was also made to forfeit the cash and the drugs, which were destroyed.

PC Matt Purser said: "This sentence is a clear reminder that both the police and the courts continue to take a zero tolerance approach to drug dealing."
