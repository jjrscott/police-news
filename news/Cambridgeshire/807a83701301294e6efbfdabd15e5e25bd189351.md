A drug dealer who jumped in the river in a bid to hide his stash of drugs must carry out 300 hours unpaid work.

Finn O'Neill, 23 of Cannons Court, Stansted, was spotted dealing drugs by a member of the public in Fen Road, Cambridge on 18 September, who alerted nearby police officers.

One of the officers borrowed a bike and made his way to O'Neill but as he attempted to detain him for a search, he made off and jumped in the river.

After pulling O'Neill from the river and arresting him, one of the officers jumped in and recovered his discarded package of crack cocaine and heroin.

He was also found with more than Â£700 in cash and a mobile phone.

At Cambridge Crown Court on Thursday (19 November) after previously pleading guilty to possession with intent to supply crack cocaine and heroin, O'Neill was sentenced to two years in prison, suspended for two years. He must also carry out 300 hours in unpaid work.

PC Alex Oliver from the Neighbourhood Support Team said: "We know that drug dealers will go to great lengths to conceal their activity but we too will go to great lengths to ensure they are arrested, charged and put before the courts."
