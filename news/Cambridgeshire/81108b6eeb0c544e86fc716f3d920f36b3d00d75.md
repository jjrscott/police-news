Police are appealing for witnesses following a burglary in Great Gransden on Tuesday (03 July).

The offenders broke into the house in Mill Road between 1.50pm and 5pm.

They stole a jewellery box and its contents and a safe containing £500 in cash raised from a charity event, £300 in rand and a selection of jewellery.

The jewellery stolen is very distinctive due to a personal hall mark of a shield with RCD in it.

Police are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident or may have seen or heard anything.

DS Colin Norden said: "The victim and her family have been left very upset by what has happened as some of the items were family heirlooms.

"I would appeal to anyone who has any information about the incident, or who may have seen people acting suspiciously in the area, to contact police.

"I would also appeal to anyone who has been offered to buy any of the items to contact us."
