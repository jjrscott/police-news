We would like to speak to these three men in connection with a theft in November.

More than Â£3,300 worth of power tools were stolen from a van in West Road, Cambridge on Friday, 30 November.

Officers are keen to identify the men and urge anyone who may know who they are to pass on information by reporting online at www.cambs.police.uk/report and quote 35/48901/18, or you can call 101.

Do you recognise these men?
