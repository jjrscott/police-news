We have released CCTV of a man we would like to speak to in connection with a robbery last month in Peterborough.

The victim, a 73-year-old woman, was walking along Paston Ridings at about 2.15pm on Tuesday, 27 November, when she had her trolley containing cash, bankcards and shopping snatched.

The woman was pushed into a bush and received minor injuries as a result.

Anyone who recognises the man or has any information regarding the incident should call police on 101 quoting 35/48221/18 or contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.

Do you recognise this man?
