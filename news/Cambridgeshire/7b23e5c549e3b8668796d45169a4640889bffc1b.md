We are appealing for information after a home was broken into in Peterborough and thousands of pounds worth of jewellery and cash stolen.

Three balaclava-clad men were seen leaving the home in Reeves Way, Eastfield, at about 1.50pm on Wednesday afternoon (17 November).

They left the scene in a black Audi A3 after having stolen £10,000 worth of jewellery and £8,000 cash from a safe.

DS Justin Parr said: "Other than the fact the offenders were men wearing balaclavas, we do not have a description them, however I am urging anyone with information to get in touch."

Anyone with information about the incident, or who may have seen suspicious activity in the area at the time, is urged to contact us online either at www.cambs.police.uk/report, or using the online web chat function and quoting incident 240 of 17 November. Those who do not have access to the internet shall call 101.
