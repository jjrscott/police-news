A man who raped a woman he met using an online dating app has been jailed for three years.

Hayden Melton, 23, was handed the sentence at Peterborough Crown Court today (23 November) after he was found guilty of rape following a five-day trial.

The court heard how Melton met the 23-year-old on Tinder in March last year and became close to her over a three-week period. The incident happened when he invited her over to his house in Fulbridge Road, Peterborough, in the early hours of Saturday, 14 April.

Officers arrested him at his house later that day after the victim disclosed what happened to family and friends.

DC Jo Nicholson said: "This has had a lasting effect on the victim and I'd like to commend her bravery in coming forward.

"While the majority of people using online dating websites are doing so with honest intentions, our experiences show us that there are people on there who display sexual predatory behaviour.

"We would also ask that if anyone has concerns around the behaviour of someone on these sites that they report them to us. While we absolutely want to prevent people becoming victims we also want to target potential offenders."

Jailed: Hayden Melton
