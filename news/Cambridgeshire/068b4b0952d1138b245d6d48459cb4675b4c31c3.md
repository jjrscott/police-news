A Cambridge drug dealer has been handed a 28 month jail sentence for dealing heroin and crack cocaine.

Jamie Churchman, 34, of Leete Road, Cambridge pleaded guilty to two counts of possession with intent to supply class A drugs at Peterborough Crown Court last week (22 April).

Officers from the Southern Impact Team arrested Churchman while on Primrose Close on April 3 after finding class A drugs in his possession.

A further search of his home revealed further drugs, cash and mobile phones.

PC Alex Oliver said: "There is no place for county lines drug dealing in Cambridgeshire. We will continue to work hard to tackle the issue and bring people before the courts."
