Officers are appealing for information following a collision in Harston on Friday (18 January).

At around 9am, 64-year-old Steven Ericsson was crossing the road outside of the BP garage on the High Street when he was involved in a collision with a car.

The driver reportedly stopped to check on Mr Ericsson but left before giving his details.

PC Henry Marshall said: "This incident took place on a busy stretch of road so I would urge anyone who may have seen a collision to come forward to police.

"Although the vehicle I thought to have been travelling at a low speed, it has caused a significant amount of pain and distress to Steven, who required hospital treatment for his injuries."

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 quoting incident 154 of the 18 January or report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report.
