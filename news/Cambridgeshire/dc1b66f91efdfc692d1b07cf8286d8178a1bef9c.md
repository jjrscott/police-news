A man who was caught growing almost Â£60,000 worth of cannabis has been jailed.

Tomas Sakalauskas, 26, was growing the haul in the upstairs rooms of a house he rented in Tirrington, Bretton, Peterborough.

Officers from the Neighbourhood and Community Action Teams in Peterborough conducted a drugs warrant on 23 December and found almost 6 kilograms of harvested cannabis in vacuum packed bags.

They also discovered a box containing several Lithuanian identification cards with Sakalauskas' picture, all of which were counterfeit.

Sakalauskas admitted charges of producing a class B drug and three counts of possession of ID documents with intention of using.

Last Tuesday (11 February) at Peterborough Crown Court he was jailed for 19 months and two weeks.

DC Helen Keighley said: "The teams worked really hard to gather the intelligence and conduct this drugs warrant. I'm pleased we have managed to disrupt the operation and that he has been jailed.

"We will continue to work hard to find and destroy cannabis farms and put the people behind them before the courts."
