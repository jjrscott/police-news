A teenager from Ramsey has been arrested in connection with catalytic converter thefts following a call from a member of the public.

We were called just before 1am this morning (Friday 5 February) with reports of interference with a vehicle in Harvester Way, Fengate.

A 16-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of theft of a catalytic converter and going equipped for theft, he has since been bailed to return to Thorpe Wood Police Station in Peterborough on 3 March.

A catalytic converter has been recovered, however it is not known which vehicle it has been removed from. It is believed the theft took place in the Fengate area.

DS Andy Harding said: "With people at home and not using their vehicles as much during lockdown, I would urge people to check their cars and vans and report any thefts of cat convertors to us."

Anyone who believes their vehicle has been targeted should report online either via www.cambs.police.uk/report or through the webchat function https://bit.ly/2D9KFKH. Those without access to the internet should call 101.

Advice on how to best protect your vehicle can be found on our catalytic converter information page on the force website.
