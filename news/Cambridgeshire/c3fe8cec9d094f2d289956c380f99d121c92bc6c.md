Can you help? We're appealing for witnesses after a serious collision in Alconbury yesterday.

The collision took place just after 4.30pm and involved one vehicle, a Ford Fiesta van, which collided with a lamppost at a roundabout on Ermine Street after leaving the A14 eastbound.

Officers attended the scene together with paramedics.

The driver of the vehicle, a man in his 40s, suffered life-threatening injuries and was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in a critical condition where he remains.

Anyone with any information regarding the crash, or any dash cam footage, should call us on 101 quoting incident 267 of 12 June.
