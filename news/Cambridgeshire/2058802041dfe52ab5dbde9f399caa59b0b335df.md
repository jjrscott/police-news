A man who attacked his partner in the middle of the night and snapped her mobile phone has been jailed.

William Wenman, 38, punched and slapped the victim multiple times to the face in the early hours of 16 January. The attack caused significant swelling and bruising to the victim's face, to the extent that she could not open her right eye.

With the victim not wishing to attend court, Wenman initially pleaded not guilty to assault causing actual bodily harm and criminal damage.

On Friday (18 May) at Cambridge Crown Court the judge permitted the use of other evidence, such as bodycam footage from officers. Wenman, of Fenland Way, Chatteris, changed his plea to guilty and was sentenced to a year and ten months in prison.

Detective Constable George Neal said: "I hope this sentence will allow the victim to move on with the rest of her life.

"This court result shows that if a victim, for whatever reason, does not want to engage with the court process then we can still pursue justice on their behalf.

"Protecting vulnerable people, including survivors of domestic abuse, is a priority for the constabulary and we will do all we can to bring offenders before the courts."
