We are urging members of the public to get in touch if you have information about a knife-point robbery in Dogsthorpe on Monday evening (25 May).

The victim, a 28-year-old man, was cycling along Welland Road near to the underpass at about 5.45pm when he was approached by a man who asked him for directions to Welland.

Two other men then approached him, one holding a knife, and made demands for the victim's wallet and phone.

Doing as the offenders said, the victim handed over his wallet and phone, but was not injured.

The man who initially approached the victim is described as about 20-years-old, 5'10" wearing a grey Nike hoody and grey Nike jogging bottoms.

The man armed with the knife is described as about 20-years-old and wore a blue hoody.

Anyone with information should contact us either online at www.cambs.police.uk/report and quote 35/34038/20, or call 101.
