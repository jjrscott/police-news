A 50-year-old man who sexually assaulted a woman in her 20s has been handed a five-year restraining order.

Kingsley Onwu, of Alex Wood Road, in Cambridge, was charged last year (2017) with two sexual offences in relation to a child and a woman in her early 20s.

He denied the offences and went to trial last month (March) at Cambridge Crown Court. After four days he was cleared of assaulting a girl under 13 by touching but found guilty of sexual assault on a female.

The court heard how in August last year Onwu had made inappropriate comments to the woman, before asking her for a hug and then began kissing her neck. She told him to stop and later reported it to police.

On Thursday (5 April) at Peterborough Crown Court Onwu was sentenced to a 12-month community order and made subject of a restraining order for five years.

Detective Constable Peter Church, who investigated the case, said: "Any type of sexual assault, however serious, is a criminal offence and will be fully investigated by Cambridgeshire Constabulary.

"This case demonstrates that even 'just a kiss' can have very serious consequences if your attention is unwanted."
