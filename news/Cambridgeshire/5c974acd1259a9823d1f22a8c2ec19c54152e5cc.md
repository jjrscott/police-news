We've released the CCTV images below of two men we would like to speak to in connection with an assault in Cambridge.

At about 6.30am on 26 January a man was assaulted by two men in King's Parade who also stole his wallet and mobile phone.

The victim, a man in his 40s, suffered facial fractures which required surgery.

DC Sam Payne, said: "This was a traumatic incident for the victim and left him with serious facial injuries.

"If you have any information about who the men in the photographs are, please get in touch as soon as possible."
