Police are appealing for witnesses after distinctive bone china was stolen in a burglary.

A house on Peterborough Road, Whittlesey was targeted in a 10-day timeframe between 15 and 25 January.

Items stolen included bone china similar to that pictured.

The items stolen in this burglary are incredibly distinctive and there's a chance they would be recognised if they are offered for sale.

Being the victim of a burglary is incredibly distressing and we are keen to find those responsible.

Anyone with any information should call police on 101, quoting crime reference number 35/6264/20. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org
