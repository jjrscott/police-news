A teenager from Peterborough is due in court today (Monday 26 October) charged with six offences including kidnap, robbery and drug supply.

The 18-year-old was arrested on Friday afternoon (23 October) after we were called about violence in Welland in the early hours of the morning.

He has since been charged with robbery, taking a vehicle without the owner's consent, kidnap, being concerned in the supply of cannabis, assault by beating and criminal damage.

He has been remanded in custody to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court today.
