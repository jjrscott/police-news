We have released CCTV of two men we would like to speak to following a burglary in Cambridge.

It's believed thieves broke into a construction site in JJ Thomson Avenue at just after midnight on Friday, 12 June, before stealing an estimated Â£2,000 worth of laser scanner equipment.

PC Ben Place, who is investigating, said: "I'm urging anyone who recognises the men pictured, or has any information about the incident, to get in touch."

Anyone with any information should call police on 101, quoting crime reference number 35/38000/20. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
