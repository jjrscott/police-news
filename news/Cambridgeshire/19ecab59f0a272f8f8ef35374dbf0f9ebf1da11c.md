Officers are appealing for the public's help in identifying five men they would like to speak to following an attempted burglary in Peterborough in the early hours of Monday morning.

At about 2am, a black four-door car pulled up outside the victim's house in Maxey Road, Helpston.

Five men, one of whom was carrying a metal pole, got out of the car and approached the victim's front door.

The men, who are all described as being black, wearing dark clothing and face coverings, began to bang on the door and shout at the victim to let them into the house.

The victim refused and alerted the police, prompting the men to return to the car and leave the scene - driving through Helpston Village towards Maxey.

DC Oliver Campbell said: "Tackling burglary is a priority for the force, as we know it can have a devastating impact on victims.

"I am urging anybody who may have witnessed this incident, or spotted the vehicle the men were travelling in, to get in touch."

Anyone with information should contact police either by speaking to a web-chat operator on our website www.cambs.police.uk/report quoting 35/57204/20. If you do not have access to a computer, you can report by calling 101.
