We are appealing for witnesses following a serious collision on the A142 near Sutton yesterday evening (7 November).

At about 7pm a Ford Focus and a Yamaha MT03 motorcycle were involved in a collision. Officers and paramedics attended the scene.

The motorcyclist, a man, was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital with serious, but not life threatening, injuries.

The road was closed while the incident was dealt with. No arrests have been made.

Anyone who witnessed the collision, or saw the vehicles in the build up to it, is asked to call police on 101 quoting incident 429 of 7 November.
