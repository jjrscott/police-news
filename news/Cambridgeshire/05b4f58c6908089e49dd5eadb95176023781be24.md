A man who assaulted his ex-partner in a Peterborough street has been jailed.

Marius Constantin, 29, spotted the woman in Lincoln Road near its junction with Burmer Road at about 5pm on 10 December.

He approached her and an argument ensued. He pulled the victim by her hair, pushed her to the ground and began punching and kicking her.

The assault was witnessed by a 15-year-old boy who provided a statement for police and Constantin was arrested four days later.

In interview Constantin, of Gladstone Street, Peterborough, admitted pushing the victim over, but denied punching or kicking her.

However, he went on to plead guilty to assault by beating at Peterborough Crown Court on Wednesday (13 January) and was jailed for two months.

PC George Corney said: "Constantin completely lost his temper as he subjected the victim to this unprovoked attack in the street.

"I'd like to thank the teenage boy who came forward to provide a statement to help us with this investigation.

"Tackling all forms of domestic abuse is one of our main priorities and we continue to work around the clock to safeguard victims and bring offenders before the courts."

More information on domestic abuse is available on the dedicated section of our website.
