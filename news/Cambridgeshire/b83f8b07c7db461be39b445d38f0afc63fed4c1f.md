Christopher died at the scene. His front seat passenger, a nine-year-old boy, suffered serious but not life threatening injuries and was taken to Peterborough City Hospital for treatment. He was released the following day (Saturday, September 2) and is now recovering at home.

Anyone who saw the collision, or the vehicle prior to the incident, is asked to contact the road policing unit on 101, quoting incident 290 of September 1.
