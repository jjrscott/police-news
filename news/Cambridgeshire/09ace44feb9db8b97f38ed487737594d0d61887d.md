Police are appealing for information after a bike, which held great sentimental value to its owner, was taken from outside a supermarket in Peterborough on Friday (18 June).

At about 6pm the bike pictured was taken from outside Budgens Supermarket, Sugar Way, while the victim was shopping.

It is described as a black Trek 3900 mens' mountain bike.

It is believed a group of men took the bike, but officers are appealing for any information.

PC Gordon Scott, investigating, said: "The bike was unlocked at the time and it seems a group of men decided it was theirs to take.

"The bike belonged to the victim's brother, who sadly passed away, so it means a lot to him.

"I would urge anyone with information to please come forward."

Anyone with information should contact police by calling 101 and quoting reference 35/39631/20, or alternatively report online www.cambs.police.uk/report. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or viawww.crimestoppers-uk.org."
