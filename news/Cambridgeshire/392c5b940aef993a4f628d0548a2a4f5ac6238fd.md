Drugs and cash have been seized following a warrant in Huntingdon yesterday.

Officers from the Huntingdon Neighbourhood Policing Team visited a property in Vicarage Court under the Misuse of Drugs Act.

A cannabis factory and a magic mushroom factory with a street value of more than Â£5,500 were found within the property and seized along with cash and other drug paraphernalia.

A 26-year-old man and a 24-year-old woman from Huntingdon were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply drugs, production of cannabis, producing a controlled drug, money laundering and possession of drugs.

They have since been bailed until 6 April.

PC Tom Russell from the team said: "We use information submitted by members of the public as well as our own intelligence to carry out drugs warrants.

"The public are often our eyes and ears and it's vital they continue to report information and concerns to us."

Anyone who suspects illegal drug activity in their area should get in touch online.
