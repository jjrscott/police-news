A man who stole four bikes from Cambridge has been jailed.

Daryl Banes, of Nicholson Way, Cambridge was handed an 18 week sentence at Cambridge Magistrates' Court on Thursday after previously pleading guilty to four counts of bike theft.

The 23-year-old used bolt croppers to steal the bikes from Cycle Point at Cambridge Railway Station twice on 14 September, 19 September and 28 September last year (2019).

He was identified by CCTV and told officers he stole the bikes so he could sell them for drug money.

Banes has also been handed a two year Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) not to enter Cycle Point under any circumstances and not to be in possession of a pedal cycle without proof of purchase/ownership.

PC Sean Tanvir said: "Banes is a prolific thief and this sentence and CBO will hopefully provide some respite to the local community while he gets the support he needs to stop offending.

"We take all reports of bike theft seriously and would encourage people to report offences so we can build up a picture and deploy resources accordingly.

"We would also encourage cyclists to take precautionary steps to reduce the risk of becoming a victim."
