We are appealing for information after two churches in the north of Peterborough have been targeted by thieves.

All Saints Church in Elton had lead from its roof removed overnight on Friday (29 March) into Saturday morning (30 March) and St Mary's Church in Wansford had lead removed from its roof on Tuesday evening (2 April).

PC Pete Mills, from the Rural Crime Action Team, said: "This type of crime is not victimless and can leave thousands of pounds worth of damage.

"We are committed to catching those responsible for heritage crimes, including lead thefts, and also disrupting the market that is driving the crime.

"I would urge members of the public to keep their eyes open to any suspicious behaviour, particularly around isolated locations at night."

Anyone with information or concerns should report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report or call 101. If a crime is in progress always dial 999.
