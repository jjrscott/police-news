A man caught with two Kinder eggs full of class A drugs has been jailed.

Phillip Keary of no fixed abode was unaware he was being watched by police when he drove into a hotel car park back in September.

Officers suspected the 53-year-old to be a county lines drug dealer and decided to approach him in the car park in Witchford Road, Ely.

They found two Kinder eggs containing 15 packages of heroin and crack cocaine. A tablet which rang throughout the search was also recovered along with some cash.

At Cambridge Crown Court on Thursday (16 January) he pleaded guilty to two counts of possession with intent to supply class A drugs and was jailed for three years. He was also disqualified from driving for 12 months.

PC Luke Upcott from the Southern Impact Team said: "We have a very dedicated team tackling class A drug dealing in Cambridgeshire.

"Drugs have a devastating impact on people's lives and dealing can often be linked to violence, intimidation and other offences.

"I hope this sends a message that this will not be tolerated in our county."
