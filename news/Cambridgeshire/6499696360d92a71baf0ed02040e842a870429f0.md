A prolific thief has been jailed for two years after stealing food and jackets.

Scott Reynolds of no fixed abode pleaded guilty to three counts of theft and four breaches of a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) at Cambridge Crown Court on Wednesday (15th April).

The 33-year-old stole clothing worth more than £500 from Topman in Cambridge and food worth more than £250 from the Co-Op in Perne Road in December last year and January this year.

He was arrested for the offences in January when he was found wearing two of the jackets with the security tags still on.

Reynolds was handed an 18 month sentence, suspended for two years in September last year after pleading guilty to six counts of theft, burglary with intent to steal and five counts of breaching a CBO.

He was given the five year CBO in August 2016 which prevents him entering any Tesco Express, Sainsbury's Local, Co-Ops, One Stop or B&M stores within the area bonded by the M11, A11 and A14.

The suspended sentence was activated and in total he has been sentenced to two years in prison.

PC Jamie Tumber said: "Reynolds if a prolific thief with a number of thefts and CBO breaches against his name. We hope this sentence will offer him the opportunity to address his offending and turn his life around."
