Tarrell Hinds who brought violence and drugs to Cambridge has been jailed for five years.

The 20-year-old of Roles Grove, Romford pleaded guilty to possession of an offensive weapon, criminal damage, being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs, handling stolen goods and possession of a bladed article at Cambridge Crown Court on Monday (19 February). He was sentenced to five years in prison.

The court heard how on 26 September last year, Hinds smashed the front windows of a property in Stretten Avenue and was in possession of a baseball bat. His finger prints were found in a vehicle which fled the scene and was later abandoned.

Then on January 4 he was seen acting suspiciously in what turned out to be a stolen BMW in Borrowdale, Cambridge. When approached by officers he attempted to make off but was arrested and found in possession of large amounts of cash, four mobile phones, cocaine, three spare car keys and a combat knife.

Detective Constable Martin Hardy said: "This sentencing highlights the consequences of coming to Cambridge and imposing violent tactics to deal drugs. County lines drug dealing is a priority within Cambridgeshire and we will maintain a zero tolerance approach towards it."
