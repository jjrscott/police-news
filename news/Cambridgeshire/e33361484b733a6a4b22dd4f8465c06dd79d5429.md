A man who attacked his father-in-law causing serious injuries including a broken nose and temporary loss of vision has been jailed.

Gavin Boot, 27, assaulted the man after pulling him out of his vehicle on Carr Road, Peterborough, on 15 November.

The victim had been on his way home from work when he stopped at a junction. Boot ran over to the vehicle, opened the driver's door and began attacking him.

Boot punched him in the face multiple times and caused a broken nose, fractured eye socket and cuts and bruises. The victim also suffered multiple seizures in the ambulance on route to hospital.

Boot, of Drake Avenue, Peterborough, ran off after the attack but was later arrested by police.

He pleaded guilty to assault causing actual bodily harm and was sentenced to 10 months in prison at Peterborough Crown Court on Tuesday (23 June). He was also handed a five-year restraining order and ordered not to visit the victim's address.

DC Louis Scott, who investigated, said: "This was a particularly nasty and unprovoked attack on an innocent man who had done nothing wrong.

"I am glad justice has been served today and hope the victim is able to find peace after what must have been a terrifying ordeal."
