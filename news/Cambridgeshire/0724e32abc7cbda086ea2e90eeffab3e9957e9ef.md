A teenager appeared before magistrates today (3 August) charged with the murder of Peter Anderson.

The 17-year-old boy from London, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared at Cambridge Magistrates' Court.

He has been charged with murder, possession of class A drugs, possession with intent to supply class A drugs, and possession of a class B drug.

A 33-year-old man arrested in connection with the investigation has been charged with being concerned in the supply of heroin and crack cocaine. He is Alan Wakefield, 33, of Swaffham Road, Lode, near Cambridge, and also appeared at the same court today.

Both were remanded to appear at Cambridge Crown Court next week.

Mr Anderson, 46, died from stab wounds after being attacked on Stourbridge Common at about 4.15pm on 25 July.
