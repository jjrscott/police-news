Police have released CCTV of a man they would like to speak to in connection with a spate of attempted thefts in the Cambridge area.

Two kebab vans have been broken into over the last three weeks, and a further one had an attempted break-in. However, at this time nothing is believed to have been stolen.

Officers are keen to identify the man in the CCTV and urge anyone who may know who he is to pass on information by reporting online at www.cambs.police.uk/report and quote 35/23621/18, or you can call 101.

Do you recognise this man?
