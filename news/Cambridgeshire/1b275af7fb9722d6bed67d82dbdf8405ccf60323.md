We are appealing for information after grave stones were damaged at a city centre cemetery.

Twelve grave stones at Mill Road Cemetery in Mill Road, Cambridge have been vandalised over the past week.

PCSO Anthony Marriott said: "This is mindless damage and disrespectful to the deceased and their loved ones.

"We would like to urge members of the public to report any suspicious behaviour in and around the cemetery to police."

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 quoting 35/47659/19 or report online. Alternatively call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
