A closure order has been granted on a Cambridge home in a bid to stop anti-social behaviour.

The order was issued to 66 Bullen Close today (16 July) after a successful application from police to Huntingdon Magistrates' Court.

The action came as a result of frequent reports of anti-social behaviour including loud music, fighting and drunken behaviour.

A full closure order was granted and the property will be closed for three months.

PC George Horsfall said: "We've received frequent reports and information relating to people visiting this address and causing anti-social behaviour.

"We hope that closing the property and preventing visitors will provide some respite to the neighbours and the community as a whole and allows them to go about their daily lives without fear, anxiety or being woken up by loud music, fighting and shouting."

The closure order states the house be closed in accordance with the Anti-Social Behaviour Crime and Policing Act 2014 until 15 October. If anyone is found on the premises unlawfully they render themselves liable to arrest.
