Officers are appealing for information following a burglary at a house in March on Tuesday afternoon (4 November).

The victim, a man in his 50s, left his house in Nene Parade at 1.10pm and returned 30 minutes later to find a brick had been put through the window of his back door.

Access had been gained via the garden at the back of the house, before the offender entered the property and stole Â£15,000 in cash from the victim's bedside table which had been put aside to pay for building work.

The offender is described as male, slim built, short, aged between 30 and 40 years old and was wearing a dark red zip up top, a black beanie hat and a bandana covering his face.
