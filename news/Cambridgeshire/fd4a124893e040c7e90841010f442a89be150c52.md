Police are appealing for information after a Poppy Appeal charity box was stolen from a takeaway in Peterborough.

The owner of Fletton Fish and Chips in High Street noticed the box had disappeared from the counter on Saturday evening (9 November) and believes it was there earlier in the day.

The value of donations inside the box is not known.

Sergeant Craig Foster, said: "To take a charity box containing donations meant for people in need is a callous and cowardly act.

"Over the last few days we have been remembering those who fought in wars and lost their lives so that we could have ours, and it astounds me that people can be so cruel as to steal from such a cause.

"I urge anybody with information to come forward and report it so that we can bring those involved to justice."

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 quoting incident 35/80481/19 of 9 November.
