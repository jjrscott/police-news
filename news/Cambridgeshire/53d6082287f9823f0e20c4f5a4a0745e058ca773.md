A Huntingdon shoplifter has been sent to prison.

Eden Ward, 24, of Ambury Hill, Huntingdon pleaded guilty to four counts of shoplifting and possession of cannabis at Peterborough Magistrates' Court yesterday (4 May) and was sentenced to 22 weeks in prison.

Between 5 and 20 April, Ward stole meat and wine from Tesco Express in Wertheim Way and Marks and Spencer in Huntingdon.

CCTV footage linked Ward to all of the thefts and he was arrested on 3 May where he was found in possession of cannabis.

PC Louise Shaw said: "We're committed to catching shoplifters and putting them before the courts. Shoplifting can have a huge impact on both businesses and those who work for them."

Ward's latest court appearance activated a 16 week suspended sentence. He was given a further six weeks for the new charges.
