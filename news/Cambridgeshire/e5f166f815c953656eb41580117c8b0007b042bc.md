A man who died following a collision in Wimblington yesterday has been named.

Police were called at about 7am to reports of a collision involving a silver Mitsubishi L200 and a pedestrian on the A141.

The pedestrian, John Ulliot, 32, of Reeves Way, Peterborough was pronounced dead at the scene.

The driver of the Mitsubishi, a man in his 50s, was taken to hospital with serious injuries.

The family of Mr Ulliot said today: "Our beloved son John sadly passed away and we are devasted. John leaves behind his fiancee Sarah and two beautiful sons, Sammie and Noah.

"This is yet another devastating blow for the family, as John sadly lost his new-born son Dean just before Christmas. He also leaves behind his mum, dad, brothers Ricki and Wade and his sister Kerrie."

Police are appealing for witnesses to the collision or anyone who saw the vehicles in the moments leading up to the incident.

Anyone with information or dashcam footage should call 101 or report online quoting incident 39 of 11 January.
