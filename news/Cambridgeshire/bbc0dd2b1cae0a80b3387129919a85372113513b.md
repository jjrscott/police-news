Officers investigating an incident of 'upskirting' in Cambridge have released an image of a man they would like to speak to.

The incident was reported on Wednesday (29 July) at about 3.30pm in the Lion Yard shopping centre, where a man was seen holding a black backpack low to the floor in a suspicious manner.

A member of the public intervened, as it appeared the man was filming up the skirts of women and children, using a camera that was hidden in the bag.

Anyone who recognises the man pictured, or who witnessed the incident take place, please contact us via our web-chat or by calling 101 quoting ref: 35/50539/20 (https://bit.ly/2D9KFKH)
