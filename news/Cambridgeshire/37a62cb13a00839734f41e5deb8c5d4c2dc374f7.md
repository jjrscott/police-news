We are appealing for witnesses after a man was seriously assaulted following a minor collision in Pondersbridge.

The incident happened at 10.40pm on Friday 2 March on Ramsey Road. The victim, a 67-year-old man, was driving his ford transit in icy conditions when he clipped a silver pick-up truck and knocked the wing mirror off.

The driver of the truck stopped in front of the victim's car and walked up to it, pulling the victim out and hitting him in the face several times.

The offender, who is white and described as having short brown hair, left in his vehicle.

The victim suffered serious facial injuries requiring hospital treatment.

PC Kellymarie Harman said: "This was an extremely nasty assault that has left the victim with serious injuries and in a lot of pain.

"We would urge anyone with any information about this incident or who thinks they know the driver of the truck to contact us."

Anyone with information should report information online quoting CF0126690318 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, by calling 0800 555 111.
