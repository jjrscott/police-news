We have released CCTV images of a man we would like to speak to in connection with a burglary in Peterborough.

On Sunday 6 January, the victim, who is in her 90s, had her handbag stolen from her home. Her bank card was taken and subsequently used in several locations, including the Triangle Supermarket in Lincoln Road, New England, at around 11pm the same day.

Anyone who recognises the man pictured or has any information regarding the incident should call 101 and ask to speak to DC Sarah Phillips.

Do you recognise this man?
