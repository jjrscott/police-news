A 32-year-old man has been charged with various driving offences after being arrested on Saturday night (6 June) in Whittlesey.

William Flatt was arrested on the A605 after reports he had stolen a car from Whittlesey. When officers stopped him they carried out a routine roadside breath test where Flatt blew 90 - the legal limit is 35.

Flatt, of New Hey Road, Huddersfiled, has since been charged with taking a car without the owner's consent, drink driving, driving while disqualified and driving without insurance.

He has been bailed to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on 16 July.
