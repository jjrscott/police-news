We are appealing for information after 'cheeky' robbers targeted Boots chemist in March on Friday evening (10 July).

Two men entered the store in Broad Street at about 5.10pm and threatened members of staff before clearing a shelf of nicotine products.

They are both described as white, slim build, average height, in their 20s and wore grey hoodies. One wore a medical mask to cover his face, while the other used a bandana.

One of the men had a tear on the back of his tracksuit bottoms, exposing one of his bum cheeks.

Anyone with information should report it online at www.cambs.police.uk/report quoting 35/45414/20 or call 101.
