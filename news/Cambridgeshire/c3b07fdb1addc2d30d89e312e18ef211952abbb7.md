Detectives investigating a burglary in Abington Pigotts are appealing for the public's help in tracing a man they'd like to speak to.

Â£500 in cash and a grey satchel was stolen from a house in High Street during the early hours of 18 February after access to the property was gained through an insecure door.

DC Victoria Norden said: "I am urging members of the public to look at these images and contact police if they recognise the man or have any information in relation to the incident."

Anyone with any information should call police on 101, quoting crime reference number 35/12663/20. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
