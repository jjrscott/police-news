Police are appealing for information following a serious collision in Wisbech involving a car and a pedestrian.

A passer-by reported a black Nissan Qashqai being involved in a collision with a man in Leverington Common, Wisbech St Mary, at about 9.25pm yesterday (29 November).

The driver of the Nissan reportedly slowed to a stop after the collision but then left the scene shortly afterwards.

Emergency services attended and the pedestrian was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital with serious injuries. He remains there today in critical but stable condition.

DI Garry Webb said: "We are particularly keen to hear from anyone who was driving in the area around the time of the incident who may have seen the Nissan or the pedestrian prior to the collision."

Anyone who saw the collision or the lead-up to it, or has dash cam footage, is urged to contact police via web chat or by calling 101, quoting incident number 450 of 29 November.
