Members of the public are being urged to continue to report incidents of dangerous driving in the Bretton area of Peterborough.

This follows an increase in reports of young people riding motorbikes dangerously in residential areas.

Reports have mostly been in the Bretton Way area but also Bretton Park where motorcycles and mopeds are being rode above the speed limit and in an anti-social manner.Crime Reduction Officer Amanda Large said: "We need community reporting and intelligence to help us identify these people as catching them in the act is an exceptionally risky strategy.

"Community reporting of these incidents is vital as all information will help build up a picture of who is responsible.

"Please try to give us as much detail as possible about the offenders; time and place of the incident, visual descriptions of both the riders and the bikes, also names and addresses if you know who they are."

Most of the incidents have taken place after school hours and on weekends and offenders have been using various types of vehicles.

Dangerous driving covers:
\- Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs
\- Driving with no insurance or without a licence
\- Speeding or careless driving
\- Driving an unroadworthy vehicle
\- Driving whilst using a mobile device
