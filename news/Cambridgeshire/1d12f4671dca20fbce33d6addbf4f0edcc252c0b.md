A man assaulted his partner before going on a violent rampage following an argument over money.

Aaron Muxlow, 30, attacked his partner at their home in Paget Close, Cambridge, on 12 June, after she confronted him about spending money he should have spent on food.

He punched her in the head several times before kicking her in the ribs and hips. She managed to grab her phone and call her sister to ask for help, but as she did so, Muxlow snatched the phone from her hand.

She ran downstairs to get away but Muxlow grabbed her by her hair and dragged her back upstairs despite her desperate pleas for him to stop.

Knowing police had been called Muxlow fled, while the victim went to stay with a friend. Muxlow messaged the friend and threatened to kill her and smash her windows. He turned up at the address in Paget Road, Cambridge, and threw something at the living room window but it caused no damage.

However, the next morning (13 June) Muxlow turned up again and used a metal bar to smash the windows of the living room, where his partner was sleeping on the sofa. He reached through and pulled the TV from its stand, causing it to smash. He repeatedly kicked the front door and shouted threats.

Muxlow was arrested and during interview verbally abused an officer, calling her offensive names and threatening to punch her. The following day, he struck an officer through the hatch of his cell at Parkside Police Station.

Muxlow pleaded guilty to two counts assault by beating of an emergency worker, three counts of criminal damage, common assault, threats to damage property, ABH and breach of a suspended sentence and was sentenced to two years and four months in prison at Cambridge Crown Court on Tuesday (8 December).

Detective Constable, Emma Melton, who investigated, said: "Muxlow showed himself to be a violent, bad-tempered person who will take his anger out on anyone around him.

"I am glad we have managed to put him behind bars and justice has been done."
