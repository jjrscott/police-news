Officers have released CCTV images of a man they would like to speak to following an attempted robbery at Tesco, Barford Road, St Neots.

At around 4pm on 29 August a fire alarm was activated and the store was evacuated.

As customers returned a man was stopped by security for attempting to steal £308 of alcohol.

He tried to flee, throwing the stolen goods at staff before threatening them with a large kitchen knife. Staff later managed to recover £208 worth of stolen items.

The man was seen leaving in a blue Vauxhall Astra.

DC Martin Hardy said: "I would urge anyone who was in Tesco this day or that may know the man pictured to come forward."

Anyone with information is asked to report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report quoting incident 35/26339/18 or by calling 101.
