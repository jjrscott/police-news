We have released CCTV footage of three men we would like to speak to in connection with an assault in Peterborough.

The incident took place outside O'Neills in Broadway, Peterborough in the early hours of Saturday, July 14.

At around 3am two men and a woman were assaulted and all three were punched in the face.

One of the men was taken to Peterborough City Hospital with serious injuries which required surgery. The other two victims received minor injuries.

DS Philip Booty said: "This was a nasty and unprovoked attack.

"I would urge anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident, or who may know the three men in the pictures or footage, to get in touch."
