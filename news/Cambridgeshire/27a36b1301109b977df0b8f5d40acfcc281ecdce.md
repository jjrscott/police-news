A Cambridge shoplifter has been handed a two-year Criminal Behaviour Order.

Marcus Sapra, 34, of Milton Road, Cambridge, was given the Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on Friday (13 November).

The CBO prevents him from entering any Tesco or Co Op in the city of Cambridge within the boundary of the A14, M11 and A11.

Sapra also pleaded guilty to two counts of theft and assault by beating an emergency worker and was given a 12 month community order, 20 day rehabilitation activity requirement and his existing suspended sentence was extended for two years.

PC Sean Tanvir from the Cambridge south neighbourhood team said: "Sapra is a prolific thief with a number of thefts against his name.

"Any breaches of the Criminal Behaviour Order will be dealt with robustly in partnership with businesses in the city."
