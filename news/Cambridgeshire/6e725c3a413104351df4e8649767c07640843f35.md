A man who stole ice-cream, meat and cheese from a Cambridge deli has been sentenced.

Jordan Earwaker, 28, of Fortescue Road, Cambridge pleaded guilty to burglary, theft and failing to surrender and was jailed for 15 months at Peterborough Crown Court on Friday (21 May).

On the evening of 17 April, Earwaker forced open the locks to the chiller cabinet at Signorelli's Deli on Burleigh Street and made off with food worth more than £1100.

In January he was caught on CCTV stealing two bottles of perfume worth £197 from Boots in Petty Cury.

Detective Constable Paul Evans said: "Burglary can have a devastating impact on victims, which is why tackling it is one of our priorities. We are working hard every day to bring offenders before the courts."
