We are keeping up to date on the news surrounding the spread of Covid 19 (coronavirus) and we are following the advice being issued by Public Health England and would urge everyone to do the same.

It is a rapidly developing situation and we will continue working closely with Public Health England and partners to make sure police officers and staff have up-to-date guidance and advice.

Guidance has been issued to all police forces based on information from Public Health England. We are not anticipating a worst-case scenario, but the public would expect us to plan for it. There are tried and tested plans and procedures to ensure we can continue to provide critical services in times of increased demand or if there are staffing capacity issues.

Further updates regarding Covid 19 and policing will be released when available.
