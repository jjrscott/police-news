We have made another arrest in connection with an ongoing arson investigation in Peterborough.

The 36-year-old man was arrested in the early hours of this morning in connection with an incident of arson in Cobbet Place on 29 February. He remains in police custody.

Three men who were charged yesterday (Thursday) in connection with the investigation have been remanded by magistrates and will appear at crown court on a date to be set.

Two men, aged 26 and 34, and two women aged 28 and 29, were arrested on Tuesday night in connection with the investigation and have all since been released under investigation.

We are asking for the public's help to trace a blue Renault Scenic, index WJ54 WYR, which we believed is linked to violent disorder in Orchard Street on Tuesday night (3 March).

DI David Simpson said: "We are keen to locate this vehicle which we believe is connected to our investigation. If anyone has seen it parked up anywhere, or believe they may know where it is, please get in touch."
