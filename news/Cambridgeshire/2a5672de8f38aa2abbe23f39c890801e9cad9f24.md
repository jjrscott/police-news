We have released CCTV footage of two men we would like to speak after they threatened a supermarket employee and stole alcohol.

The men walked into Sainsbury's in Eddington Avenue at about 11pm last Thursday (25 April) and placed several bottles of spirits into plastic bags.

A member of staff, a woman in her 40s, confronted the pair who threatened to "punch her to the ground" if she intervened before they walked out of the shop.

PC Dave Tudman said: "I am appealing for anybody who recognises either of the men pictured to get in touch.

"She has understandably been left shaken by this incident."
