Officers investigating an assault in Cambridge on New Year's Day have released CCTV footage of a man they would like to speak to in connection with the incident.

The assault, which is believed to be sexually motivated, happened at about 3am in Milton's Walk close to Christ's Pieces.

The victim, a woman in her 20s, was approached from behind and assaulted. A struggle took place, in which the victim bit the offender, before members of the public intervened and scared the man off.
