A jury has returned a unanimous guilty verdict following a three-day attempted murder trial in Peterborough.

Mark Calvert Elliott, 54, of Wingfield, Orton Goldhay, denied he was trying to kill his 82-year-old mother on 9 October last year (2018), despite attempting to suffocate her.

A 999 call came in from Calvert Elliott at about 11.15pm to say he had just tried to commit euthanasia on his mother by suffocating her with his hands.

He told officers how he wanted to send his mother, who is bedridden after a serious stroke several years ago, "to a better place".

He was arrested and later charged with attempted murder, however in court he denied he was going to fully go through with the act.

Detective Sergeant Rob Sansom said: "This was a truly sad case, however Calvert Elliott's actions could have resulted in his mother losing her life and that decision was not his to make. Thankfully the victim's daughter and son-in-law entered the room when the incident was taking place and the victim has not sustained any long-lasting injuries as a result of this."

On Thursday (28 March) a jury at Peterborough Crown Court returned a unanimous guilty verdict following a three-day trial.

Calvert Elliott is due to be sentenced at the same court on 10 May.
