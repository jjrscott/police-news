A man has been arrested on suspicion of drugs offences following a proactive patrol by officers from the Southern Impact Team.

On Monday, officers spotted a man acting suspiciously in Rustat Road and carried out a stop search at about 10.30am.

The 20-year-old, from London, was arrested on suspicion of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply, and drugs worth about Â£1700 were seized.

He has since been released under investigation while officers continue their enquiries.
