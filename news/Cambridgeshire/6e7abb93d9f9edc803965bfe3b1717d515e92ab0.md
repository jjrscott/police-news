A man who led officers on a high-speed pursuit along a narrow lane, forcing dog walkers to jump out of the way, has been jailed.

Adam Reeves, 31, was driving a Renault Captur in Eye, near Peterborough, at about 11am on 28 August when officers on patrol received information that the car might have been stolen.

When officers attempted to stop the vehicle Reeves accelerated. He drove at speeds of more than 50mph in built-up areas, before making his way to Woolfellhill Road.

He drove at more than 60mph down the narrow lane, causing pedestrians to jump onto a grass verge with their dogs to avoid being hit.

Reeves eventually came to a dead end, got out of the vehicle and ran away. After a short distance he fell over and was arrested.

He admitted dangerous driving, failing to stop and driving without insurance.

On Friday (19 October) at Peterborough Crown Court, Reeves, of Godsey Crescent, Market Deeping, was sentenced to six months in prison and disqualified from driving for two years and three months.

PC Claire Cummings said: "Reeves had absolutely no consideration for others as he drove dangerously and thankfully nobody was hurt.

"We take driving offences very seriously and reckless behaviour will not be tolerated."
