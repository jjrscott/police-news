Four people have been charged after three drug warrants were carried out in Peterborough yesterday morning (Thursday).

Officers from across the force, including detectives, neighbourhood teams, dog unit and specially trained search officers visited properties in Hartley Way, First Drove and Viersen Platz.

Two women, aged 22 and 24 and a 28-year-old man from Peterborough, as well as a 60-year-old man from Glasgow, have all been charged with being concerned in the supply of cocaine and cannabis, as well as money laundering.

They have all been remanded in custody to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court today (Friday).
