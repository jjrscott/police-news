A 39-year-old man has been charged with attempted burglary following a call from a member of the public.

It was reported that a man was breaking into the Spar convenience store in Welland Road just before 5am yesterday morning (30 March).

Police were deployed and arrested Gavin Lloyd, of Harebell Close, Dogsthorpe, at the scene.

He has since been charged with attempted burglary and has been bailed with restrictions. He will appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on 21 May.
