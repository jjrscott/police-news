Two men have been arrested and a third voluntarily interviewed in Peterborough this morning (12 July).

Officers from the Community Action Team worked together with the Central Intelligence Bureau (CIB) and immigration officers to execute the warrant on two adjoining properties and a shop in London Road.

Inside one of the properties officers discovered a large amount of tobacco and cartons of cigarettes, along with cannabis. A 21 year old man was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply cannabis and tax evasion.

A 47 year old man was arrested for immigration offences and a 24 year old man will be voluntarily interviewed in connection with the investigation.
