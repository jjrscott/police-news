An inmate who threw a metal bin at a prison officer during disorder at HMP Peterborough has been jailed.

Paul Tripp, 45, got involved in a commotion between prisoners at just after 6pm on 11 September 2019.

The ruckus began after a mobile phone was found on a prisoner in one of the wings.

Several prison officers tried to calm the situation, however, Tripp picked up a metal bin and threw it off a balcony, hitting a prison officer below.

The victim, a man in his 20s, was treated for two cuts to the head at Peterborough City Hospital.

Tripp initially denied involvement but later pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding after he was identified through CCTV footage inside the prison.

Tripp, formerly of Dunstable Road, Bedfordshire, was sentenced to four years and 10 months in prison at Luton Crown Court on Friday (5 February) - two years and two months for the prison offence and the rest for separate offences of burglary and cultivation of cannabis in Bedfordshire.

**DC Leeza Phillips said:** "Tripp injured an innocent prison officer after becoming involved in an outburst of violent behaviour.

"No one deserves to be assaulted while simply doing our job and I hope the sentence gives Tripp some time to reflect on his dangerous actions."
