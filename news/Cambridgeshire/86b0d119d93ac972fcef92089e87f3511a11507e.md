Police are looking to identify the driver of a black 4x4 involved in a collision which left an 81-year-old man with potentially life changing injuries.

The collision happened in Paston Ridings, Peterborough, between 8.45am and 9am on Sunday (24 November).

The driver did not stop, leaving the elderly man lying in a puddle with a serious leg injury. He was taken to hospital, where he remains in a serious condition.

When officers spoke to him he said: "This has knocked my confidence. I don't know what is going to happen to my leg. I can't walk and won't be able to for a long time, perhaps for the rest of my life."

PC Sam Shepherd said: "This has been an incredibly traumatic experience for the man, who has been left with potentially life-changing injuries. I would urge anyone who witnessed the collision or has dash cam footage to come forward."

Anyone who witnessed the collision or saw any of the vehicle in the moments leading up to it is asked to contact the road policing unit by calling 101 and quote incident 123 of 24 November, or report information online at www.cambs.police.uk/report.
