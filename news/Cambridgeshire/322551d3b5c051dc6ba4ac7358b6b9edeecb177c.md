A man has been charged with stealing a bicycle from a Peterborough secondary school last month (January).

The 30-year-old was arrested near Asda in Rivergate on Friday night (29 January) in connection with the theft of a push bike from the King's School in Park Road on 7 January.

He has since been charged with theft of a pedal cycle and has been bailed to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on 22 March.
