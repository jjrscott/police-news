A March woman has been jailed for 12 months after her Jack Russell dog bit a five-year-old girl on the face.

Theresa Graves, 80, was walking the dog called Deefa in Estover Road, March, in June last year when she saw the victim playing in a front garden with her three-year-old sister and grandmother.

She held the dog up to the girl, asking if she wanted to kiss it, but as the girl did so the dog bit her face, leaving her with injuries that required hospital treatment.

Graves, 80, of Estover Road, March, admitted being in charge of a dangerous dog and was sentenced at Cambridge Crown Court on Friday (27 October). She was also disqualified from owning a dog for life and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £140.

Her son, David Graves, 41, also of Estover Road, admitted being the owner of the dog and was ordered to do 180 hours of unpaid work. He was also disqualified from owning a dog for life and ordered to pay the victim £85.

The dog was ordered to be put down.

Detective Constable Mark Yendley said: "This case shows how important it is to keep dogs under control in public places and how seriously the courts treat incidents of this nature."
