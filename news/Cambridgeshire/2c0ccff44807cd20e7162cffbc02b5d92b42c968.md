A woman from Chatteris has admitted assaulting three officers at her home address last month.

Becki Thomas, 26, was arrested at her home in West Park Street in the early hours of 21 July after police attended reports of anti-social behaviour.

Whilst officers tried to engage with Thomas, she became hostile and aggressive, biting one of the officers on his arm.

Thomas was arrested following the assault and walked out to a police van where she then spat at two officers.

She was charged with three counts of assaulting an emergency worker which she pleaded guilty to at her first appearance in court on 22 July.

On Wednesday (12 August), Thomas appeared at Peterborough Magistrates' Court where she was sentenced to a 12-month community order, 20 days rehabilitation activity requirement (RAR), 50 hours of unpaid work and must pay Â£200 in compensation to the officers.

DC Jessica Martin said: "Our police officers come to work every day to keep our communities safe and protect people, they do not deserve to be treated like this when they are just doing their job.

"Hopefully Thomas has had time to reflect on her behaviour and realises her actions were not acceptable."
