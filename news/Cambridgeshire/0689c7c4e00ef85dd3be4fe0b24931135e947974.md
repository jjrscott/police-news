A man has been charged after being stopped by officers in Wisbech last night (Wednesday 20 January) on suspicion of drink driving.

The 57-year-old was arrested in Market Place just after midnight after providing a breath sample of 47 - the legal limit is 35 microgrammes of alcohol in 100ml of breath.

He has since been charged with drink driving, as well as being in possession of a knife in a public place and cannabis.

He has been bailed to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on 22 March.

Anyone with information about someone who carries a knife is urged to report it to us via https://bit.ly/39QTINc.
