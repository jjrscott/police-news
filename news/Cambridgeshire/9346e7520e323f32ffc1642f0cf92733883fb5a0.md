A man is due to appear in court today charged with murder.

Kai Nazir, 19, of The Crescent, St Neots has been charged with murder and grievous bodily harm with intent and will appear at Peterborough Magistrates Court this morning.

Emergency services were called to Monkfield Lane, Cambourne at about 12.35am on Saturday (28 October) with reports of violence.

One of the victims, a 30-year-old man, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. The other victim, a man in his 20s, was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge with serious but not life threatening injuries.
