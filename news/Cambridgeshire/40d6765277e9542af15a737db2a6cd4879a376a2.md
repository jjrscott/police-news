Police are appealing for information after two teenagers were robbed and assaulted in Cambridge on Sunday (9 September).

At about 9pm the pair, who were with a group of friends, were approached and surrounded by a group of about 12 to 15 youths on Parker's Piece.

The friends tried to leave but one of them was punched twice to the back of the head, leaving the 19-year-old man with minor injuries. The other victim, aged 17, had his bag containing Â£10 and a mobile phone stolen.

DC Kayleigh Fillary said: "This incident has left the two victims understandably shaken.

"We are keen to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time and may have seen anything suspicious."
