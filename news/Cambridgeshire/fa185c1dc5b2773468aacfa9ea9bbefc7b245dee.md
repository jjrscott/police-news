A woman attacked her friend in a fit of anger on the doorstep of a house in Peterborough, a court heard.

Georgina Blakemore, of Johnson Walk, Peterborough, launched the attack at about 6pm on 1 April last year.

The 29 year old walked to the house and accused the woman of causing criminal damage before hitting her at least five times, Peterborough Crown Court heard.

Another occupant of the house overheard the commotion and intervened, pushing Blakemore away.

Police arrived and the victim, 23, was taken to hospital with serious injuries, including a fractured cheek bone.

Blakemore was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent.

In police interview the following day, she claimed she punched the victim because she was angry and believed the woman had caused criminal damage to her home.

However, she claimed she was hit first and had retaliated.

Blakemore pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of causing GBH without intent at Peterborough Crown Court on 7 May.

She was sentenced at Peterborough Crown Court today (4 June) where she was handed a 12 month prison sentence, suspended for two years. She was also ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work.

Detective Sergeant James Weston said: "This was a terrifying incident for the victim.

"There is absolutely no excuse for this behaviour."
