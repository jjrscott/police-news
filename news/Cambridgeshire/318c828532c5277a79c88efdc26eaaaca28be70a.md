Police are appealing for information following a ram raid in High street, Fulbourn.

At 2.10am today, a Land Rover Discovery was driven into the Co-op store and a cash box stolen from an ATM machine.

CCTV footage from the shop shows a white hatchback and a dark saloon, believed to be an Audi A5, following the Land Rover to the scene.

The four offenders were wearing masks and dark clothing. They left the Land Rover at the scene and escaped in the remaining two vehicles.

Detective Sergeant Andy Denzey said: "This was a well-organised group of criminals that has caused a significant amount of damage.

"It is vital that we bring those involved to justice so they cannot commit a similar offence again in the future."

Anyone with information regarding this incident should call police on 101 quoting CF0179350418 or visit www.cambs.police.uk/report. Alternatively, contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111 or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org
