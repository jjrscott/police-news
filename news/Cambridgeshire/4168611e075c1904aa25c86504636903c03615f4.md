A 23-year-old man is due in court after being arrested on Friday (8 May) on suspicion of stealing a car from Gunthorpe.

Torin Gibson, of Malvern Road, has since been charged with taking a car without the owner's consent, driving without insurance, without a licence and failing to stop for police.

He has been released on bail to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on 9 July.

A 25-year-old man was also arrested at the time, but was later released with no further action.
