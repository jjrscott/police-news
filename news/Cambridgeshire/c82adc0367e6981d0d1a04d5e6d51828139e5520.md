We are appealing for information following a serious collision involving two vehicles on the M11 yesterday afternoon (Sunday 16 December).

The collision happened at about 1.50pm on the M11 southbound at Trumpington, a mile from junction 11, between a silver Mercedes C260 and a black Nissan Micra.

The front seat passenger of the Micra, a woman in her 20s, suffered life-threatening injuries and was taken by ambulance to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge where she remains in a critical condition.

The driver of the Micra suffered minor injuries. The driver of the Mercedes and two children travelling in the back were not injured. Both drivers were women.

Anyone who witnessed the collision, either vehicles in the lead up to it, or has dash-cam footage, is asked to contact us by calling 101 and quoting incident 241 of 16 December.
