Officers are urging people to stay vigilant and keep an eye on vulnerable relatives after a number of suspected rogue trading incidents across Cambridge.

Police have received reports of rogue traders calling on elderly or vulnerable people and asking them for money for carrying out work on their home, which has not been completed.

During one incident in Bosworth Road, a vulnerable man in his 50s was conned out of Â£400 after fraudsters said they needed to replace his toilet.

He handed over the cash but the works were never carried out.

Members of the public are being urged to report any similar instances to police, but are also reminded to stay alert and be cautious of any doorstep traders.

Community Safety Officer, Kate Thwaites, said: "Rogue traders often offer gardening work or maintenance services at attractive rates but the quality of work is substandard, unnecessary or overpriced.

"They also use persuasive sales techniques to encourage people into making hasty decisions.

"Doorstep selling is not illegal, but legitimate callers won't mind if you ask them to come back later while you verify that they are genuine.

"Ask them to leave their details and a quote and you can call them back once you've had time to decide whether you would like them to carry out the work.

"Also ask to see their ID."
