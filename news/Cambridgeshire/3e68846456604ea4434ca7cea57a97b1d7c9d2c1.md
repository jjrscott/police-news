We've released CCTV of the moment an armed man carried out a robbery at a bookmakers in a bid to get information from the public.

A man wearing a motorcycle helmet went into Ladbrokes, in Broad Street, Cambourne, at about 7.20pm on February 17 and pointed what was believed to be a handgun at the cashier.

He demanded access to the safe but the member of staff locked himself in the back office and raised the alarm.

The robber stole cash from the till and made off.
