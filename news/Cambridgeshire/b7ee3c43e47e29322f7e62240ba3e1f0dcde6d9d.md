Officers investigating a robbery in Peterborough on Friday (6 July) are appealing for information.

At 7.25pm, two men entered Coral bookmakers in the Westwood Centre with hoods pulled up.

One of the men held a syringe to the throat of a customer whilst the other demanded money from the cashier.

The pair fled on foot with more than Â£550 in cash.

Detective Constable Mark Clapham said: "Thankfully nobody was seriously injured during this violent incident, although the staff and customers involved have been left understandably shaken.

"The two men pictured may have stood out as they were wearing hooded jumpers on a warm summer evening."
