A man who assaulted a teenage girl has been jailed for 20 weeks.

Fezhan Bahadur, 20, of no fixed abode pleaded guilty to two counts of assault by beating and was sentenced at Huntingdon Magistrates' Court on 26 November.

On 6 November Bahadur assaulted the 16-year-old girl he met on Instagram over the head in in High Street, Warboys.

A few days later on 10 November in Upwood after an argument over a text message the girl had received, he began to strangle her and put his hand over her mouth before hitting her face and pulling out her earring.

As well as a prison sentence, Bahadur has been given a restraining order which lasts until 25 November, 2020 and prevents him from going to the White Hart pub.

Sergeant Michael Basford said: "Tackling domestic abuse is a priority for the force and we are committed to safeguarding victims and putting perpetrators before the courts.

"We hope this sentence will give Bahadur the opportunity to reflect on his actions."
