Emergency services are currently at the scene of a serious multi-vehicle collision on the A16 between Eye and Crowland.

We were called at about 5.25pm this evening (Wednesday 23 January) with reports of a collision between three vehicles.

A number of people have been injured and the air ambulance has been at the scene.

The road is closed in both directions and will remain closed for several hours, therefore motorists are urged to avoid the area.

Anyone who has dash-cam footage of the collision is asked to contact the road policing unit by calling 101.
