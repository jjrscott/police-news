Police have named a woman who died at a property in Cromwell Road, Peterborough, on Tuesday (2 July).

At about 6.40am officers and paramedics attended the scene following reports of violence. They discovered three people with serious injuries.

Ligita Kostiajeviene, 42, of Cromwell Road, died at the scene. A post mortem conducted on Wednesday (3 July) concluded she died as a result of severe head injuries.

Another woman, who is in her 30s, and a nine-year-old boy were taken to hospital with stab wounds. The woman has been discharged, but the boy continues to receive treatment. His injuries are not life threatening.

Andriejus Kostiajevas, 46, of Cromwell Road, appeared at Norwich Crown Court today (5 July) charged with murder, attempted murder, assault causing grievous bodily harm and assault on an emergency worker. He has been remanded in custody to appear at Cambridge Crown Court on 16 August.

Ligita, who leaves behind an adult daughter, has been described as a loving and caring mother who will be missed more than words can say.
