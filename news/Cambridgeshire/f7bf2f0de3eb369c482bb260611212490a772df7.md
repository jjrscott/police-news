A London drug dealer who travelled to Cambridge to sell cannabis has been sentenced.

Jose Oliveira, 24, of Worcester Crescent, London drove his grey Seat Ibiza to Gwydir Street car park on 28 March last year.

Officers searched his vehicle after suspecting he was dealing drugs and found a bag of cannabis, some scales and two mobile phones.

At Cambridge Crown Court yesterday (6 October) Oliveira was sentenced to nine months in prison, suspended for 18 months after previous pleading guilty to possession with intent to supply cannabis. He must also carry out 140 hours unpaid work and has been given a six month curfew to be at home between 8pm and 6am.

Detective Constable Emma Melton said: "There is nowhere to hide in this county for drug dealers and those who seek to exploit the vulnerabilities of others."

Anyone who suspects drug dealing can report it here.
