A man found growing cannabis in Cambridge has been jailed.

Members of the public alerted police to a potential cannabis factory in Farran Close on 6 November last year (2020).

Officers acted on the intelligence received immediately and discovered 31-year-old Muharem Bamie at the property with 386 cannabis plants.

Bamie was arrested and the plants, with a street value of up to Â£324,000, along with the growing equipment were removed and destroyed.

At Peterborough Crown Court on Friday (8 January) after pleading guilty to production of cannabis, Bamie was sentenced to 20 months in prison.

Detective Constable Paul Evans said: "This is a great example of the police and public working together. We can't be everywhere and we rely on people in our communities being our eyes and ears. If you suspect something isn't right, it more than likely isn't.

"Thanks to the information received we were able to prevent these drugs from making it to the streets and put Bamie before the courts."

We would encourage people to look out for signs of illegal cannabis factories including blacked out windows and people coming and going at various times of the day.

If you suspect drug activity in your area, report it to us.
