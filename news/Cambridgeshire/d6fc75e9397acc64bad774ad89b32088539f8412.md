Officers are appealing for witnesses following an incident in Peterborough where an elderly lady had her handbag snatched.

At about 9am on Tuesday (12 June) the victim, who is in her late 70s, was walking along Chaucer Road when a man wearing a white hoodie ran up behind her and stole her handbag.

A spokesperson for Cambridgeshire Constabulary said: "Thankfully the victim was not hurt during this incident, but she has been understandably shaken by the experience.

"We're keen to speak to anyone who witnessed what happened, or may have seen the man in the areas near Lincoln Road and Rhubarb Bridge."
