The St Neots Neighbourhood Policing Team have uncovered a cannabis factory in Little Staughton thanks to information from the public.

The team raided a unit on Little Staughton airfield yesterday afternoon (27 May) and found 285 cannabis plants inside at various stages of growth.

The factory is estimated to be worth up to Â£240,000 if all the plants were to reach full maturity.

No arrests have been made but an investigation into the factory has been launched.

Sergeant Rob Streater, who runs the team, said: "This find has stopped a substantial amount of illegal drugs finding their way to the streets.

"I would encourage those who have suspicions of illegal activity to report them to us, no matter how insignificant it may seem. People coming and going around the clock and blacked out windows are just a couple of things to look out for."

Information about illegal drug activity can be reported via www.cambs.police.uk/report or by calling 101.
