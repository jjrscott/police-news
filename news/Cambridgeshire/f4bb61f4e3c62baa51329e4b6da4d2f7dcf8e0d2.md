Officers are appealing for information following six arsons in and around the John Clare recreation ground in Gunthorpe.

It is believed the fires were all started deliberately, causing damage to the grassland in the park before being brought under control by the fire service.

We are appealing to anyone who saw anything unusual in the areas and times below:

 * Hallfields Lane - 1.20pm, 22 July
 * Gunthorpe Road - 2.20pm, 22 July
 * Hallfields Lane - 6.50pm, 22 July
 * Pennine Way - 5.30pm, 23 July
 * Fulbridge Road - 7pm, 23 July
 * Fulbridge Road - 7.30pm, 23 July

Sergeant Rob Reay said: "With the current heat wave these mindless acts could turn into a mass incident with the dry grass in close proximity to housing and businesses. If anyone witnessed anything which may assist our inquiries please contact us as a matter of urgency."

Station Commander Pete Jones, Arson Liaison Officer for Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service, said: "Arson is a serious crime and can have severe consequences for those that start a fire, no matter how big or how small it is.

"Not only this, but any fire presents significant risks for anyone around the area if it gets out of hand, as well as for the fire crews sent to tackle them."

Anyone with information regarding these incidents should contact police on 101 quoting incident number 224 of 22 July or report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report.
