A man who used a kitchen knife to stab a 'friend' in the back and hand has been jailed for more than four years.

A fight broke out between Geremeskil Solomon and a 19-year-old man in one of the bedrooms of a youth hostel in Gonville Place, Cambridge on 4 July last year.

Solomon, 19, used a grey handled kitchen knife to stab the victim twice in the back. The victim also received two lacerations to his hand.

Residents called police and the ambulance service and Solomon was found in another bedroom. His clothes were bloodstained and the knife was found blood stained in his bedroom bin.

The victim suffered superficial wounds to his back but serious injuries to his left hand.

Yesterday (23 March), Solomon was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in a young offenders institute at Cambridge Crown Court after previously being found guilty of section 18 - wounding with intent.

PC Sarah Knights, who investigated, said: "This was a completely unwarranted level of violence, which could have had fatal consequences.

"Solomon knew the victim and the pair were considered to be 'friends'.

"The victim still hasn't regained full movement in his hand demonstrating the dangers of choosing to pick up a knife."
