A man has appeared in court today (15 February) in connection with an incident over the weekend in which three police officers were assaulted.

The incident began after the driver of a Volkswagen Golf failed to stop for police in Peterborough yesterday (14 February).

The vehicle was stopped by officers from the BCH Roads Policing Unit (RPU) just before midday on Bakewell Road, and one man was arrested.

While dealing with the incident one officer was assaulted at the scene, while a further two were assaulted at Thorpe Wood Police Station.

Aivaras Osikas, 25, of Outfield, Bretton, Peterborough, was later charged with failing to stop, failing to co-operate with a preliminary test (roadside breath test), drink driving and three counts of assaulting an emergency worker.

His first court appearance took place at Peterborough Magistrates' Court today (15 February), where he was released on conditional bail until a further court hearing at Peterborough Crown Court on a date to be set.
