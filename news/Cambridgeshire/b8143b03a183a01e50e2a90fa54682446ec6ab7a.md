Detectives investigating the murder of a man in Wisbech last week have arrested a fifth person.

Tom Lewis, 23, of Larksfield in Wisbech, was airlifted to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge from Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Kings Lynn on Tuesday (8 September) to undergo surgery to his leg after he was stabbed in Norwich Road in the early hours of the morning.

He was placed on life-support in intensive care but was pronounced dead on Thursday afternoon (10 September) after a decision was made to end his life-support treatment.

A 23-year-old man from Wisbech was arrested yesterday (Monday 14 September) on suspicion of murder. He remains in custody at Thorpe Wood Police Station in Peterborough.

Four men aged 18, 22 and two aged 32, were arrested last week on suspicion of murder, however they have all since been released from custody pending further investigation.
