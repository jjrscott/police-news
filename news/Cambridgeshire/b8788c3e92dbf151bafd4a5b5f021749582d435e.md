A THREE year Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO) will go live in parts of St Ives today (18 February) as part of a multi-agency approach to combat anti-social behaviour.

The St Ives Neighbourhood Policing Team have been working with Huntingdon District Council on ways to reduce general, vehicle and night-time related anti-social behaviour in areas of the town.

The PSPO will see the following prohibitions are imposed:

**Anti-social behaviour order**

At all times, persons will not act in a manner that is causing or is likely to cause, harassment, alarm or distress in the designated area.

**Alcohol - related**

 * Persons must immediately leave the designated area marked in red for a period of 24 hrs if ordered to do so by a designated officer.
 * Should the individual live or work within the designated area their right to access these will not be affected;
 * Alcohol must be disposed of or surrendered if requested by a designated officer;

**Vehicle - related nuisance**

 * Persons not to use a vehicle in a manner likely to cause alarm, harassment or distress;
 * Persons not to gather in their vehicles or park their vehicles in groups of two or more to congregate and may result in causing alarm, harassment or distress;
 * No person shall use their vehicle to cause unreasonable levels of noise including the noise from engines and exhausts and the playing of music from car stereos; and
 * Persons not to drive their vehicles in an anti-social manner

Sergeant Alice Draper said: "St Ives Neighbourhood Policing Team and Huntingdonshire District Council have been working together to establish the needs of the community through extensive review and consultation.

"The PSPO aims to encompass the various different types of anti-social behaviour (ASB) which affect St Ives and provides additional powers to both organisations to deal with ASB in specific locations of high demand.

"We hope that we can make a positive impact on the town and wider community with a firm but fair approach to dealing with ASB, and avoid some of the more problematic and ingrained issues which have previously been experienced in the town emerging again as the weather improves."
