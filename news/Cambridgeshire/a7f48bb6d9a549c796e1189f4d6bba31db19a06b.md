Carl Scarrow was caught by police climbing out the window of a house in The Causeway, Soham, with socks over his hands and holding a torch on 20 April.

A neighbour had called 999 after hearing noises coming from the house and knowing the owner had died 13 days previous.

When police challenged Scarrow, 34, he said he was collecting some of his items from a friend's house. When he was told he was under arrest he attempted to run but was tackled to the ground.

During a struggle, he broke an officer's glasses, causing damage worth Â£270\. Eventually Scarrow calmed down and was handcuffed.

A bag being carried by a female accomplice was searched and five TV remotes, a video camera and a device to check blood sugar levels were discovered, all from the property.

Scarrow, from Soham but living in a tent near a sewage works, pleaded guilty to dwelling burglary and obstructing a constable in their duty, and at Cambridge Crown Court on 24 May was sentenced to 12 months in jail.

DC Jennifer Park said: "Scarrow may have thought he was in luck in finding an empty house, but the work of our officers and the sentence given to him have shown this is not the case.

"As a force we are always working to tackle burglary and make our communities a safer place to live in."
