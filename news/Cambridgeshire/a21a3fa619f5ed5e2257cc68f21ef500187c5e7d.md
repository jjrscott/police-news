A house in Chatteris has been closed to visitors following numerous complaints of anti-social behaviour (ASB) and criminality.

The order will be issued to 34 West Park Street by the local Neighbourhood Policing Team this evening (Monday 19 October), due to people at the premises engaging in anti-social behaviour and the use of the premises being associated with persistent disorder and criminality.

An initial notice was served on the house on Saturday (17 October), lasting 48 hours until police could apply to magistrates for a full closure order to be made.

The successful application was made to Cambridge Magistrates' Court today for the order to be in place for the next three months.

The order states the premises are to be closed immediately prevent disorder or persistent serious nuisance to members of the public.

Until 19 January 2021, the order only allows named individuals from entering the premises, including the legal tenant and the emergency services. Anyone not specifically named on the court order is prohibited from accessing the premises.

Failure to comply with the order is a criminal offence which could result in imprisonment for up to three months, a fine, or both.
