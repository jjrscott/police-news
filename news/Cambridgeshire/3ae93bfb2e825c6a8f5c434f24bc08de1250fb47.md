Three men are due in court charged with robbing a 75-year-old man in Peterborough yesterday afternoon (Wednesday 16 September).

We were called by CCTV operators at about 1.15pm with reports of a suspected robbery in Minster Precincts behind Peterborough Cathedral.

The 75-year-old victim was walking with his wife when he was robbed of his Hublot watch.

Three men aged 24, 23, and 17, were all arrested in Huntingdon less than 45 minutes after the report.

They have all been charged with robbery and have been remanded in custody to appear at Peterborough Magistrates' Court tomorrow (Friday 18 September).

The 24-year-old has also been charged with possession of a class C drug.
