A prolific criminal who was released from prison this summer has landed himself in jail, again.

Paul Priestley, 41, who has a criminal record spanning 25 years, was arrested on 8 September after being seen on CCTV trying car door handles in the Lyvelly Gardens area of Parnwell.

He had been released from prison in June after serving time for offences including theft from vehicles, and had a criminal behaviour order (CBO) imposed on him specifically prohibiting him from touching or entering any unattended vehicle without the permission of the owner.

PC Danny Cummings said: "Priestley has a considerable number of previous convictions for theft from motor vehicles. His last conviction saw more than 170 offences being taken into consideration when sentencing was imposed.

"Despite having a criminal behaviour order, just three months after being released from prison Priestley was at it again."

In interview Priestley, of Scalford Drive, Peterborough, fully admitted breaching his CBO and interfering with vehicles, apologising for his actions and becoming tearful in front of officers.

On Friday (11 October), he appeared at Peterborough Crown Court and was sentenced to 14 months in prison after pleading guilty to breach of a criminal behaviour order (CBO) and six counts of interfering with a vehicle with intent to steal.
