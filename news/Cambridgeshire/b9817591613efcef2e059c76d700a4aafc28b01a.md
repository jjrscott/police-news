Police are appealing for information following a collision where a car failed to stop yesterday on the B1042 near Croydon in Cambridgeshire.

At about 2.30pm the car, reported to be a light-coloured Land Rover, was involved in a collision with a 78-year-old cyclist.

After colliding with the man the vehicle carried on without stopping and the victim was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital with serious injuries.

Officers believe the vehicle is likely to be damaged on the near side. It also lost a wing mirror cover, which was retrieved at the scene.

Anyone with any information, dash cam footage or who may have seen this vehicle should contact police on 101 quoting incident 267 of 19 December and ask for Sergeant Stephen Andrews.
