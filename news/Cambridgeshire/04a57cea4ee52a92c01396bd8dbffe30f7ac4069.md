We are appealing for information to locate a vehicle in connection with a ram raid in Isleham this morning (Tuesday 17 April).

The incident took place at the Co-op in Mill Street at about 4.35am.

We want to locate a dark Audi estate, described as sporty, possibly an 'RS' or 'S' model, with an index of 'YM55FHH', however it is possible the plates may have been changed.

Anyone who has seen what could be this vehicle in the Huntingdon, Godmanchester or Hinchingbrooke areas is urged to contact us.

Anyone with information is asked to report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report quoting incident 335 of 17 April or call 101.
