A prisoner who sent a threatening and abusive letter to her ex-boyfriend detailing how she was going to disfigure and murder him has been sentenced.

Alice Leek, 26, was serving an 18 month sentence at HMP Peterborough, when a prison officer intercepted the letter on 13 June last year.

In the six page letter Leek said: "You best watch your back because I'm coming for you and your family, you and your house will go up in flames, but before it goes up in flames you are going to get stabbed to deathâ€¦you will be walking around always looking behind you because you never know when it is going to happen."

Leek was under a restraining order not to communicate with her ex-boyfriend in any way. In police interview, Leek said she wrote the letter to 'voice her anger'.

On 4 February, at Peterborough Crown Court, Leek pleaded guilty to harassment and was sentenced to 16 months in prison to run concurrently with her existing sentence.

DC Morgan said: "Leek wanted to disrupt the life of her ex-boyfriend who she hadn't contacted for more than a year previously, causing him unnecessary fear through violent threats. She knew this was not only wrong but went against the rules of her restraining order.

"Hopefully, the rest of her time spent in prison will allow her to gain control of her anger and move on."
