Officers investigating an attempted robbery in Cambridge are appealing for witnesses.

At about 2pm on Monday (14 May) the victim, a woman in her 60s, was walking along Carlton Way when she was approached by two men who got out of a small white car.

The men tried to grab the woman's handbag and assaulted her, before she was able to flee the scene. She received minor injuries as a result of the incident.

Both men are described as white, 5'8", roughly in their 30s with brown hair. One of the men was of heavy build with a round face and was wearing a white t-shirt with a picture on, black trousers and brown shoes. The second man was slim and was wearing a black t-shirt, beige coloured jeans and possibly white trainers.

The vehicle is described as having '100' as a partial number plate.

Detective Constable Ciaron Hickey said: "This was a frightening experience for the victim.

"There were a number of people in the area at the time of the incident. I'd appeal to anyone who saw what happened to get in touch as a matter of urgency."
