Police officers and staff across Cambridgeshire joined together yesterday (26 November) to hold a burglary day of action.

The day yielded great results across the county with eight suspects arrested and hundreds of homes made safer, through the work of the crime prevention teams. Staff also took part in Facebook Live Q&A sessions and a number of officers were deployed on patrols in burglary hotspots.

While every day is a day of action for all teams across the force, yesterday was a chance to not only highlight the good work of the burglary teams and apprehend burglars, but also to prevent incidents by arming people with knowledge and tools to protect their homes and property.

November is an ideal month to hold such a day as it is often when forces across the country see a spike in burglary offences.

Detective Chief Inspector, Dan Middleton, said: "Burglary is a priority area for the force and we will not become complacent in our efforts. We remain focussed on preventing burglaries and bringing perpetrators to justice."
