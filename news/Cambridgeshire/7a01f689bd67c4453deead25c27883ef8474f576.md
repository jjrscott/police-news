A man found with an axe, knife and knuckle-duster in a busy town centre has been jailed for 13 months.

Axe found by police

Ben Rider, 35, was reported to patrolling officers by a concerned member of the public at about 9pm on 5 November last year after they saw a 'bizarre handle' poking from his pocket.

Knuckle duster found by police

As the two officers approached, Rider attempted to flee but was restrained and arrested. During a search, officers uncovered the weapons along with class A and B drugs.

Knife found by police

In interview, Rider claimed he knew it was an offence to carry the weapons but, "it was only for show."

Morphine found by police

Rider, of Follens Road, Walpole St Andrew, near Wisbech, admitted charges of possessing an offensive weapon in public, resisting arrest and possession of class A and B drugs.

Speed found by police

He was sentenced on Friday (11 January) at Peterborough Crown Court.

Ben Rider

PC Harley Smart said: "Regardless of whether or not Rider intended to use the weapons, he broke the law and distressed a member of the public in the process.

"I would like to commend the quick-thinking member of the public who alerted officers and hope this sentencing will serve as a reminder of the consequences of carrying weapons"
