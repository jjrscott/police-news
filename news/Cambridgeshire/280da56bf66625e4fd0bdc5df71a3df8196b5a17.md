A pair who attacked a teenage boy in a Cambridge park have been sentenced.

Lewis Clark, 19, and Dale Barker, 24, saw the 15-year-old boy and two friends cycle into the park near Cambridge Road, Girton, on 30 June last year.

When the boys, two aged 15 and the other 14, stopped, Clark approached them and demanded the victim get off his bike.

He threatened the boy and began to assault him before he was joined by Barker, who also attacked the victim.

One of the boy's friends managed to escape during the attack and raised the alarm by calling his parents.

Barker, of Dunmowe Way, Fulbourn, and Clark, of Comfrey Court, Cambridge, admitted affray.

Yesterday (11 December) at Cambridge Crown Court Barker was sentenced to 14 months in prison, suspended for 18 months, and Clark to 10 months, suspended for 18 months.

Barker was also ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work and Clark 100 hours.

DC Luke Whatford said: "The victim had gone to the park with his friends to enjoy a game of football. Instead, he was subjected to a terrifying and unprovoked attack as Clark and Barker assaulted him."
