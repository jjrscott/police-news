We have released CCTV images of a man we want to speak to in connection with an attempted burglary in Peterborough.

On the morning of 4 December, the occupants of a house in Essendyke, Bretton, found a butter knife on the ground behind their car.

After checking their CCTV system, a man was seen trying to force his way into the house via a window the night before.

Anyone with information about the incident, or who recognises the man in the images is urged to contact us online either at www.cambs.police.uk/report, or using the online web chat function and quoting crime reference 35/82360/20. Those who do not have access to the internet shall call 101.
