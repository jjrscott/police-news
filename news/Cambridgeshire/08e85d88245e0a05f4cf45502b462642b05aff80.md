We are appealing for witnesses following a fatal collision on the A10 at Royston yesterday afternoon (Wednesday 27 January).

The incident happened at about 1pm on the A10, Royston Road, just north of the A505 junction and involved a black Vauxhall Insignia, a white Iveco Daily 35S13 and a grey Ford Fiesta.

The driver of the Fiesta, a woman in her 50s, suffered fatal injuries, while the drivers of the other two vehicles were unhurt.

The driver of the Insignia, a 27-year-old man from Bedfordshire, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He has since been released from custody pending further investigation.

We are appealing for witnesses or anyone who has dashcam footage of the moments leading up to the collision.

Anyone with information should call 101 or visit www.cambs.police.uk/report quoting incident 217 of 27 January.
