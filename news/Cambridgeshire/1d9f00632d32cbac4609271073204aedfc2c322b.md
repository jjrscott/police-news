Detectives investigating a murder in Peterborough have charged a woman.

The 18 year old from Peterborough has been charged with murder and remains in custody to appear at Cambridge Magistrates' Court on Tuesday (23 October).

The body of a man was discovered in a car in Oakdale Avenue at 7.10am on Sunday (21 October). The man, who is in his 20s, was confirmed dead a short while later.

A post mortem examination today at Peterborough City Hospital concluded he died from a single stab wound to the chest.

A 19-year-old woman from Peterborough, who was arrested last night on suspicion of conspiracy to murder, has been released under investigation.
