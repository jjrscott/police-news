A man who was caught driving a Porsche while using a fake licence has been sentenced.

Bruno Te, 28, was stopped while driving his Porsche Panamera in Westgate, Peterborough, on 22 January.

When he was asked for his documents Te produced a Portuguese driving licence.

Unfortunately for him, the officer had been specially trained by the DVLA in the examination of official documents and he immediately recognised it was a fraudulent licence.

Te was arrested at the scene and due to the licence being false his insurance was also invalidated.

In interview he admitted he shouldn't have been driving as he hadn't passed a test and he knowingly obtained the false documents.

Te, of Hinchcliffe, Orton Goldhay, pleaded guilty to possessing false identity documents with intent and driving without insurance.

He was sentenced yesterday (1 June) at Cambridge Crown Court to four months in prison, suspended for 18 months, 120 hours of unpaid work and 12 months disqualified from driving.
