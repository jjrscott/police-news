A prolific thief has been jailed for more than a year.

Amor Hussain, 38, of Lutton Grove, Peterborough pleaded guilty to theft of a pedal cycle, possession of a knife, theft from a motor vehicle as well as breaching a suspended sentence from last year.

Today, at Peterborough Crown Court he was jailed for a total of 76 weeks.

On 1 July Hussain was caught stealing a bike in Peterborough city centre and was found in possession of a knife. He also stole a bag from a parked car on 19 May.

PC Jeremy Turner said: "Hussain is a prolific thief with a number of thefts against his name. The city will be a safer place now that he is behind bars."
