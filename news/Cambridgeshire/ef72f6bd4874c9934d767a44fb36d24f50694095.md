A man who knocked through into his neighbour's loft space as part of his £100,000 cannabis factory set up in Peterborough has been jailed.

Klodjan Toska, 26, was arrested on 29 September after 121 cannabis plants worth up to £101,640 were discovered growing at his home in Burmer Road.

Police were alerted to the grow by a concerned neighbour who, after having smelt a strong scent of cannabis had discovered their loft wall had been drilled through and an extractor fan installed.

Toska admitted producing cannabis and appeared at Cambridge Crown Court on Friday (30 October) where he was sentenced to a year and four months in prison.

DC Claire Atkinson said: "The actions of Toska were having an impact on his neighbours who had their lives disrupted due to the constant smell in their home, and damage caused to their own property.

"I would strongly urge anyone with information or concerns about drugs dealing or production to report it to us so we can build up a stronger picture of criminal activity in our communities."
