Three people have been arrested after a series of warrants were carried out in Peterborough yesterday (31 March).

Officers from the Peterborough Neighbourhood Support Team visited three properties, in Ledbury Road, Clarence Road and Southfields Drive, where they seized a number of items including two imitation hand guns and a large quantity of cash.

As a result, two men, aged 28 and 29, and a 60-year-old woman were arrested on suspicion of money laundering and remain in custody at Thorpe Wood and Parkside Police Stations.
