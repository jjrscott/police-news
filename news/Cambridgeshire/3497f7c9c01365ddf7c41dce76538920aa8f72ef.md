A prison inmate who threw a bin full of human waste at guards has had 30 months added to his sentence.

Violent offender Ahmed Jama, 26, was serving a 12-year sentence at HMP Whitemoor near March for a stabbing, when he launched the attack in August.

Jama had been placed in a segregated unit due to his temperamental and challenging behaviour.

Three prison officers went to his cell and asked him to pass them his bin in order for it to be emptied and cleaned.

Instead of following these instructions, Jama hurled the contents of the bin, which contained a mixture of urine and faeces, at the guards.

The attack, which is commonly referred to as "potting", left all three guards covered in faeces, despite their attempts to close the cell door.

Jama refused to be interviewed about the offence, but later admitted charges of administering a noxious substance with intent to injure.

He was jailed for an additional 30 months last week on Friday (29 June) at Cambridge Crown Court.

DC Shelly Reeve said: "This was a vile, unprovoked attack that has understandably had an effect on the victims.

"Prison staff work hard to ensure the safety of inmates and should be able to do so without fear of being attacked."
