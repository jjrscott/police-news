Police have released an image of a mountain bike they suspect to have been stolen in a bid to reunite it with the rightful owner.

The bike was found in Orton Goldhay in the early hours of Monday morning (7 September).

Officers from the Peterborough policing team have checked the bike against existing reports of bike thefts but have been unable to find a match.

PC Whybray said: "We're keen to reunite this bike with its owner and would urge anyone who has been a victim of bike theft to look at the image to see if you recognise it."

Please contact us via our web-chat or by calling 101 quoting incident 18 of 7 September. You will need to be able to provide some proof of ownership.
