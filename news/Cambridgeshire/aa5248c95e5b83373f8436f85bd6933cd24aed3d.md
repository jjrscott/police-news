A Neighbourhood Policing Team (NPT) in Peterborough has launched an operation in response to concerns raised by members of a community.

The Eastern NPT, which covers areas including Millfield, set up Operation Siphon to tackle drug dealing and related crime, as well as traffic issues and covid compliance.

PC Laura Henning, from the Eastern NPT, said: "Drug and traffic issues have been highlighted to us as being a big concern to residents and business owners in Millfield and the surrounding areas, which is why we have set up the operation to work with partner agencies and tackle the issues head-on."

In addition to regular patrols, problem solving work and day-to-day neighbourhood policing in the area, the team dedicated three days last week to the Millfield area.

The results were:

 * 130 fixed penalty notices issued for parking offences
 * 10 traffic offence reports issued
 * Four vehicles seized
 * 21 people stop-searched under the Misuse of Drugs Act
 * Two vehicles stopped and searched under the Misuse of Drugs Act
 * Two people arrested for burglary and drug offences
 * Four people cautioned for drug offences
 * Four fines issued for covid breaches
 * One ticket issue under the Vehicle Defect Rectification Scheme

PC Henning added: "While the work has been led by my team and I, we have had some great support from Peterborough City Council's Civil Enforcement Officers, as well as the Beds, Cambs and Herts Road Policing Unit and Dog Unit.

"We have worked together to achieve some great results for our communities, however this is not a one-off, we continue to listen to our neighbourhoods and act on their concerns. The work of Operation Siphon will continue across the eastern sector of Peterborough and we will be holding focussed days of action again very soon."

Concerns can be passed on to your local neighbourhood team, by reporting online here.
