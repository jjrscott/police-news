We are appealing for the public's help to crackdown on disqualified drivers in the county.

PC Rob Savill said: "Disqualified drivers have had their licence taken away for a reason and by continuing to use the roads put other road users at risk.

"We are appealing for the public's help in making the roads safer by providing us with any information they have about disqualified drivers.

"In particular we are keen to know the names of those committing these offences, what vehicles they are using, where and when they are using them.

"The more information we have about these offenders the more targeted we can be in our efforts to catch them and make the roads safer."

Anyone with information regarding an illegal road user is asked to report online at www.cambs.police.uk/report/Report-Shared/Report-anti-social-driving or by calling 101.
