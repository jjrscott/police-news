Two more men have been arrested in connection with the discovery of a cannabis factory in Wisbech.

The factory, which contained about 480 young plants with a potential future yield of up to Â£250,000, was found by officers on Friday (September 15) in Oakroyd Crescent.

This afternoon (Wednesday) two men, aged 35 and 39, both from Wisbech, were arrested in connection with the find. They remain in custody at the Police Investigation Centre (PIC) in Kings Lynne.

On Monday morning (September 18) a 49-year-old man from Wisbech was arrested on suspicion of cultivating cannabis. He has since been released from police custody but remains under investigation.
