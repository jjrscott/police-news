Officers have released CCTV images of three men they would like to speak to in connection with a robbery in Peterborough.

At about 2.30pm on 29 November, a man was assaulted in Church Walk and had his mobile phone, wallet, bus pass and bank card stolen.

The victim, a 60-year-old man, was approached by one of the men, who was pretending to be drunk. Two other men approached and barged him to the ground before stealing his wallet and phone.

The suspects fled the scene on foot, allowing the suspect to stand up and walk home.

PC Matt Reed said: "If you recognise the men in the CCTV images, please get in touch with us, any information could really assist our investigation."
