A teenager remains in our custody tonight on suspicion of breaking into a Hull charity shop in the early hours of this morning.

Two boys and a man were arrested in the area after CCTV operatives saw people breaking into the shop in Holderness Road at shortly before 12.15am today (Friday, 20 November).

Our teams rushed straight to the area and recovered property taken from the store, which has been returned to the charity.

A 17-year-old is continuing to assist us with our enquiries, while a 19-year-old man has been cautioned in connection with the incident.

A 16-year-old boy has been released without charge.
