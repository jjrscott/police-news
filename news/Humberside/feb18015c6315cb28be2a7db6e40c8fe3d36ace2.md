Following a warrant by the Hull Central Neighbourhood Team at a property on Ena Street yesterday (Thursday 19 November), the tenants have been evicted and address secured.

Acting on community information that the property was being used for drug taking and dealing activity, the team took enforcement action in order to prevent the property from causing the community further harm. All occupants of the address were evicted, the property closed down and keys returned to the landlord.

Community Beat Manager Tim McGowan said: “I would like to thank the community for coming together to enable us to take positive action against this address.

“We hope they feel safer knowing that the property will no longer be a centre of criminality and anti-social behaviour in their area.

“Any piece of information we receive from our communities is taken into account and wherever appropriate, we will take action.

“I would urge residents to continue engaging with their local team or reporting information via 101.”
