Three men were sentenced to more than 13 years on Monday 15 February 2021 at Grimsby Crown Court in relation to a robbery on Wellington street on 20 November 2020.

Wayne Price, 39, of Wellington Street, Grimsby was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in jail for robbery and possession of a bladed article.

Robert Mobbs, aged 26, of Harlow Street, Grimsby was also given a four-and-a-half year sentence for robbery, breach of a suspended sentence, as well as affray and possession of an offensive weapon.

Adrian Mobbs, 42, of Stanley Street, Grimsby was served with a four-and-a-half year sentence for robbery.

Detective Sergeant Ian Potter said: “I am pleased to see this sentence being given out to these three individuals as these types of crimes are extremely unsettling and frightening for the victims and disruptive to communities.

“I would like to thank those who responded to our CCTV appeal on social media and helped us to identify, arrest and charge these men.

“If you need to report a burglary in action please call 999. Or, if a burglary or robbery has already taken place, please call 101 to report and we’ll make sure this goes to the right teams who can investigate further.”
