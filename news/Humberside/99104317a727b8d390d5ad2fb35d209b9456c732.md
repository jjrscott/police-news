Martin Jennison stood trial this week following an incident on 16 January where a woman suffered life-changing injuries at a house on Henson Villas Pearson Park, Hull.

In January 2019 he was charged with attempted murder, possession of a bladed article and breach of a restraining order and remanded in custody.

Talking during the trial Detective Constable Green said; "Martin Jennison appeared at Hull Crown Court on 15 February where he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of Section 18 wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, possession of bladed article and breaching a restraining order.

"The sentencing today is a clear message to him and others like him that intimidate and show violence towards women that we will pursue cases against them through the courts and support victims throughout their investigations

"The victim in this case gave evidence during the trial and I am extremely grateful for her bravery and courage throughout the investigation.
