Last night a car, believed to have been stolen in a North Yorkshire burglary, was spotted by officers on the A63 travelling at speed. The vehicle was asked to stop, which it failed to do, and fled travelling at over 100mph.

The car was followed to an address in Wawne. At the address two men in their 20s were found and arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle, failing to stop for police and dangerous driving. They will also be questioned in connection with a burglary in North Yorkshire.

The vehicle, an Audi S3 was recovered and will be forensically examined before being returned to its rightful owner.

The two men remain in custody as we continue our investigations.
