A number of people have been arrested following reports that a man was assaulted on Peel Street in Hull earlier this evening, Wednesday 7 October.

We were called shortly after 8pm with reports that a man had suffered serious injuries in an assault.

Officers were quickly deployed to the scene and investigations were carried out in the area. As part of this a number of people have been arrested, they all remain in our custody whilst enquiries continue.

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call our non-emergency 101 line quoting log 500 of 7 October. If you would prefer to report information anonymously you can do so by calling the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

We are particularly keen to hear from anyone that witnessed anything suspicious in the area, or anyone that was driving nearby who has dashcam footage.
