Another cannabis factory has been shut down by our teams as part of our ongoing commitment to tackling drug related crime in our communities.

A 23-year-old man and an 18-year-old woman were arrested on suspicion of the production of cannabis after 44 plants were found at an address in Pavilion Crescent, Hull.

Officers carrying out the warrant also found the electrics in the property had been tampered with and that a sophisticated heating and watering system had been installed.

The man and woman have since been released, pending further enquiries.

Neighbourhood Beat Manager Tim McGowan said: “Cannabis grows in residential properties can pose a serious fire risk to neighbouring properties, as the electricity supply is tampered with to bypass the meter.

“We know from speaking to people in this area that tackling issues like this and wider drug related crime is important to you.

“I hope that the action taken here will demonstrate that we are listening and that we’re committed to showing criminals their activities will not be tolerated.

“If you have any concerns about what’s happening in your area, please speak to my team and I while we’re out and about, call us on our non-emergency 101 line or message us @humberbeat on Facebook or Twitter.”
