A man has sadly died following an assault on Peel Street in Hull on the evening of Wednesday 7 October.

We were called shortly after 8pm with reports that a man had suffered serious injuries in an alleged assault in the street.

Emergency services attended and the man was taken to hospital for treatment however he has since died. His family have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers.

Detective Superintendent Simon Gawthorpe said: “Investigations into the circumstances of the assault are underway and as part of our enquiries so far, a number of people have been arrested, they remain in our custody whilst enquiries continue.

“Extra officers are in the area tonight, both to carry out enquires and also to offer reassurance to the community, I would encourage anyone in the area with concerns or information to speak to them.”

“We do believe there to have been a large group of people in the area at the time of the assault and we are urging witnesses, or anyone with information that may assist our investigations, to get in touch. If this is you and you are under the age of 18 then I would encourage you to speak to a trusted adult and contact us

“You can call us on 101 quoting log 500 of 7 October or you can report information anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers by calling 0800 555 111.”
