The team attended an address on St Pancras Close, Hull where they found a quantity of what is believed to be class A drugs, weapons and thousands of pounds in cash.

An 18 year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon, money laundering and being involved in the supply of drugs.

A 35 year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs.
