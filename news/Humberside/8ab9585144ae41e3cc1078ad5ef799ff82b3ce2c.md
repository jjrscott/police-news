A 15-year-old boy remains in our custody on suspicion of burglary following his arrest in the early hours of this morning.

At approximately 3.55am this morning, Thursday 13 August, we received a report that a property on Cropton Road, Hull had been broken into. A bag had been reported stolen that contained car keys which had allegedly been used to subsequently steal a car.

Officers located the car in North Hull but after it failed to stop and the occupants began to run away, our dogs section and a drone from Humberside Fire and Rescue Service joined the area search.

As part of the search, police dog Tom was deployed who detained a teenage boy in a nearby garden.

Our enquiries are ongoing but we would ask anyone who may have witnessed the incident to get in touch with us on 101, quoting crime reference number 16/84678/20.
