A man has been arrested on suspicion of burglary in the early hours of this morning, following reports of a break-in and an attempted break-in in Scunthorpe.

We were called at 1.30am following reports of a break-in at a property in Southfield Road, followed shortly by a call from a man to say he had seen a figure running from his garden in Laurel Way.

Officers were immediately sent to the area and a 42-year-old man was arrested in connection with the reports. He remains in our custody, assisting us with our enquiries.
