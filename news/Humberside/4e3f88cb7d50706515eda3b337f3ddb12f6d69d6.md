A Hull man who broke a man’s jaw over allegations he had left a threatening message on his sister’s voicemail has been jailed for 20 months.

Wayne Gleeson, 38, of Tamar Grove, Hull, admitted wounding following the assault, which happened at 7.45pm on Tuesday, August 11, 2020, after the victim, his partner and her two young nieces were spotted by Gleeson – who is a distant relation.

As they walked down Field Street, Hull, Gleenson cycled up behind him and assaulted him, punching him to the jaw a number of times, causing him to fall to the floor, before kicking him repeatedly.

Gleeson was charged after being traced and arrested by our Operation Galaxy teams.

Detective Constable Jenny Ransom said: “This was a vicious attack which left the victim with serious injuries – and could have easily been far worse.

“As it was, he was unable to eat properly for six weeks.

“I’d like to thank him for his courage in coming forward and throughout our investigation and I hope that today’s outcome will help him to put this incident behind him.”
