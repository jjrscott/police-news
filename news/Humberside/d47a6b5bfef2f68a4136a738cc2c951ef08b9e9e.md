On Wednesday 24 February a man was sentenced at Hull Crown Court to 30 months in prison for seriously assaulting a Police Officer.

The assault took place as officers detained Wilson after receiving reports a man had stolen items from a shop on the Promenade, Bridlington.

Appearing in court Wednesday, David Wilson (32) of Cliff Street, Scunthorpe was sentenced to 30 months in prison and ordered to pay £190 in charges after admitting to causing actual bodily harm to an emergency worker.

Chief Constable Lee Freeman said: “I want to make it clear that any assault of this kind on anyone will not be tolerated. That includes our officers, staff and other emergency workers who by the nature of their work expose themselves to increased risks every day to ensure the public are kept safe.

“Police officers are there to protect the public and while they will always run towards danger as part of their duty and service to keep people safe, they should not have to endure or experience any form of violence.”

“We will never tolerate the actions of anyone who thinks this type of behaviour is acceptable and will always look to take action and seek prosecution for those individuals who commit such offences.”
