Five teenagers have been fined after admitting damaging Christmas decorations at Flemingate Shopping Centre, Beverley on Sunday 13 December.

All five of the teenagers were required to pay £80 each to cover cost of reindeer as well as making a written apology.

The Christmas reindeer, a popular feature of the shopping centre’s annual decorations, had one of its legs and antlers broken in a disrespectful and destructive act of damage.
