Two men have been arrested by our Roads Crime Team, just before 6pm yesterday, Monday 4 January, on suspicion of being involved in the production of cannabis, after a large cannabis factory was discovered at an address on Queen Street, Withernsea.

Approximately 1,000 plants have been discovered across ten rooms. The sophisticated set up had been dangerously extracting electricity, common with cannabis grows, which can put surrounding properties and businesses at risk.

A scene guard remains in place whilst the Operation Galaxy team continue to dismantle the grow.

The two men remain in our custody.

PC James Stothard, the Beat Manager for Withernsea, said: “Taking down organised criminals involved in the production and distribution of drugs is incredibly important to our Force.

“I would continue to encourage our local communities to report any information, no matter how small, they feel could help our action against drugs in their area.

“You can report drug activity by calling our non-emergency number 101, or by speaking with your community team. Alternatively, if you wish to remain anonymous for any reason, you can contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
