This morning, Thursday 22 October, the Hull Central Neighbourhood Team successfully executed a misuse of drugs act warrant at a property on Hinderwell Street in Hull.

Upon entry, the team discovered approximately £50,000 worth of cannabis plants at various stages of growth. The sophisticated setup had dangerously tampered with the energy supply in order to produce the cannabis, potentially putting neighbours in danger.

Local Beat Manager, PC Tim McGowan, said: “Whilst we may not have identified those responsible for this grow yet, we will be conducting a thorough investigation with the aim of bringing the producers to justice.

“We will continue to act upon information supplied to us by the community in order to tackle criminal organisations intent on putting people around them at risk.

“On searching the property, we also seized weapons such as an axe and crude taser, meaning those weapons cannot cause harm to our communities.

“I encourage anyone with any information relating to drugs, or any other illegal activity, to contact us on 101 so we can take appropriate action.

“Crimestoppers is also a great way to report crime, whilst remaining anonymous. You can call them on 0800 555 111.”
