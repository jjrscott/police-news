On Wednesday 17 March, at approximately 11pm, we were made aware of a road traffic incident where a car had reportedly been driven through a garden and had collided with parked cars on Laceby Road in Grimsby.

A man has since been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and a public order offence.

We would like to thank the members of the public who greatly assisted our officers and helped with our enquiries.

Thankfully no one was injured in the incident.

The man remains in our custody whilst our investigations are ongoing.
