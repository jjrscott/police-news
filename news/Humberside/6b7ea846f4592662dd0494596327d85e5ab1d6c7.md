Officers from the local Beverley Neighbourhood Policing Team, working alongside Op Galaxy officers, yesterday (Tuesday 1 December) carried out a misuse of drugs act warrant at a house on The Leases in Beverley.

Once inside the property officers found around 80 fully mature cannabis plants, worth around £40,000 along with dried cannabis with a value in excess of £10,000.

A man was arrested during the warrant. Subsequently Edison Pula (19) of no fixed abode, has been charged with the production of cannabis and is due to appear at Hull Magistrates Court today.

We are working hard to tackle the growing and distribution of drugs in our communities and would appeal for anyone with information about drugs being grow in their area to call us on 101 to report their suspicions.
