We are concerned for the safety of 19-year-old Chloe Fewster from Hull and are appealing for help locating her to make sure she is safe and well.

Following a missing person appeal published on Sunday 27 December, Chloe was found by officers and spoken with on Monday 28 December, but fresh concerns have been raised for her safety.

Officers have been completing extensive enquiries around the areas she is known to attend, however, these have so far proven negative.

Chloe is described as being white, 5”5’ tall, of a slim build with long brown hair.

Detective Chief Inspector Pete Thorp said: “Chloe, if you are reading this, we want you to know that you are not in any trouble, we just want to make sure you’re okay.

“Please get in touch with us on 101 as soon as you can, so that we can speak to you.”

Anyone who believes they have seen Chloe or has any information that could help us to find her should call 101 quoting her name.
