We’re issuing advice following a number if recent shed and garage burglaries in Swanland and Anlaby over the past few nights.

Please check that your sheds a garages are locked and anything of value, such as bikes and equipment are anchor-locked to the floor or walls and stored securely.

Preventing access to your gardens too is essential so keep all gates and entrances locked up as much as possible.

If you see anything suspicious at all, anybody looking as though they are ‘scoping’ a property out, or anything out of the ordinary where you live please contact us.

We have recovered a number of bikes in the past week as well in the area, a grey Merlin racer style bike, a grey GT (with pink stickers) ladies frame mountain bike and a light coloured Carrera mountain bike have all been recovered and are currently in our property stores. If you believe any of these items are yours please get in touch so we can reunite these bikes with their rightful owners. _(UPDATE: we have had a call regarding the two grey bikes - it looks like we have found the owners and they will get their bikes back as soon as possible)._

As always if you have any information about these crimes, call us on 101, 999 if you see a crime in progress, or anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
