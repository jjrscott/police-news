Following a misconduct hearing at the Old Magistrates’ Court building in Goole, PC Daniel Ward has today, Wednesday, November 11, been dismissed from the Force.

Mr Ward’s conduct is ruled to have breached the standards of Professional Behaviour in respect of honesty and integrity, as well as duties and responsibilities, contrary to the Police (Conduct) Regulations 2012.

An independent panel, led by a legally qualified chair, heard Mr Ward had been dishonest about his whereabouts and availability on a number of occasions.

Following the two day hearing, the panel found that Mr Ward’s actions amounted to gross misconduct and he was dismissed with immediate effect.

Detective Superintendent Matthew Baldwin, from our Professional Standards Department said: “We expect our officers to act with honesty and integrity at all times and Mr Ward’s conduct was dishonest, falling well short of the standards we expect.

“The first priority for the overwhelming majority of our officers and staff is to serve our communities to the very best of their ability and we will not accept any officer or member of staff behaving in a way which fails to uphold their role and duties.

“It’s vital that we maintain the public’s trust and confidence by removing anyone from the force whose behaviour undermines this.”
