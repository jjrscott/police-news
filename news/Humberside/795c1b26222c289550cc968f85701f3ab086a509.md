Five people were arrested and a quantity of drugs were seized when our Op Galaxy team carried out a warrant at an address on Cole Street in Scunthorpe over the weekend.

Officers attended the property on Sunday 5 April, where they found suspected class A drugs as well as a number of items suspected of being used in crime.

Two women and three men were arrested at the address. All five have been released under investigation whilst enquiries continue.
