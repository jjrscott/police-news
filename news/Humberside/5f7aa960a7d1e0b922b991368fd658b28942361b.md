Officers investigating a reported assault on Oxford Street, Grimsby have been granted authorisation to stop and search members of the public suspected to be carrying a knife under Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.

The Section 60 is in place from 7pm today, Saturday 21 September, until 6am tomorrow, Sunday 22 September, and applies to the area shown in the map below.

A Section 60 gives temporary additional powers to officers, allowing them to stop and search anyone in a particular area for a specified period of time, without requiring reasonable grounds to do so.

This differs to our usual stop and search powers, which can be used at any time and place provided there are reasonable grounds for the search to take place.

Detective Inspector Nicola Foster said: “We have sought these additional powers following reports of large scale disorder involving weapons in the area yesterday evening and an alleged assault in the early hours of this morning.

"Two men have been arrested in connection with the alleged assault, they remain in our custody whilst enquiries continue.

“We will not stand for this behaviour and anyone considering carrying a knife should be warned that we do not take offences of this nature lightly.

“Officers will be in the area throughout the evening and into tomorrow morning and will be carrying out searches, taking appropriate action against anyone found to be carrying a weapon.”
