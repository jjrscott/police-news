Whilst the Operation Galaxy teams have been making arrests and forcing doors open with warrants, with 49 now arrested and 20 warrants executed, there’s also an abundance of action that continues into the evenings and overnight with the main priority of disrupting criminality and keeping people safe.

Chief Superintendent Darren Downs, the lead for Operation Galaxy said: “We’ve recruited over 500 new officers in the past three years, meaning we’ve got more people on the street to protect the most vulnerable in our communities, tackle the issues that matter to you the most and engage with a purpose.

“As part of Galaxy, we have targeted and deployed both uniform and plain clothed officers to 15 hotspot areas which are known for higher levels of crime and antisocial behaviour over the past two nights, to offer a highly visible presence and act as a deterrent to criminals who would commonly gather in these areas.

“We have also conducted proactive stop and searches during the evening across the force area, with 48 being completed in 48 hours that have generated 14 new leads for further activity, as well as the arrest of a man who had been wanted for seven months for failure to appear at court.

“Numerous checks have been made on individuals who have Domestic Violence Protection Orders against them, to ensure those who are vulnerable are protected and any risks are immediately identified.

“Six people wanted on warrant have also been sought out and arrested for a variety of offences including; sexual offences, possession of a firearm, money laundering and possession with intent to supply drugs amongst others.

“In addition to this work taking place, our Neighbourhood Policing Team (NPT) officers are also out and about in the community more throughout the day, talking with local residents about what is going on in their area and offering reassurance.

“Engagement with you as the people we serve is a crucial part of ensuring this operation’s success, which is why our NPTs are now more highly visible and door knocking in areas where warrants are taking place, to update you on the action taken and that we are not letting criminals resume their activity as the lockdown restrictions ease.

“They also want to know what’s concerning you in your area and will be gathering information from communities as to what issues are bothering you the most. So far, officers have knocked on over 550 doors across the force area.

“It’s important that if there is an issue that is causing you concern, you tell our neighbourhood officers, as they are there to protect you and make your area a safer place.

“Over the coming weeks, you will see more of our officers out on patrol on your streets, housing estates, parks and shopping areas, and I would encourage you to please stop and speak to them. We are here to listen, offer help and reassurance, and to also act on any information that could result in disrupting any type of criminality.”
