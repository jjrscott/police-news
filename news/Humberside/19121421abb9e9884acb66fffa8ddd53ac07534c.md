*Three Vietnamese men have been charged with being concerned in the production of a controlled drug, namely cannabis, in connection with this.

They have already appeared in court this morning Wednesday 31 July

We are not releasing their names at this point as further investigations are continuing.*

...

Three men have been arrested after a suspected cannabis grow with an estimated street value of between £2.5million and £4 million was uncovered by our officers.

Our teams carried out a warrant at the premises in an industrial unit in Park Farm Road, Scunthorpe, on Sunday, 28 July.

Detective Inspector Kerry Bull said: “This premises has been converted into an industrial sized professional cannabis grow.

“I believe that there are in excess of 15,000 plants in various stages of cultivation.

“Our forensic teams and specially trained search officers are working on site to secure evidence and remove the plants and equipment for destruction.

“We will continue to identify and close down these operations and bring to justice those involved in the production and supply of controlled drugs which we know can bring misery to our communities.”
