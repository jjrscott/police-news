A new Humber Talking mobile, community drop in ‘pod’ has landed in Hull this evening to encourage you, the public, to come and talk to police, the fire service and the council about any concerns or issues, or just for a chat!

The pod is a mobile hub that will travel around the Humberside force area, allowing us to have a presence right into the heart of the community and to be available to you.

Our teams have been working closely with Humberside Fire and Rescue Service and the local councils over recent months to bring this multi-agency facility to the streets.

The pod will start off in Hull City Centre for a number of weeks before moving on to another area to help us understand what your concerns are and how as partner agencies, we can jointly deal with any emerging issues.

Chief Inspector Lee Edwards said: “This pod will give us a really clear visible presence in the community meaning that people can come and chat to representatives from each service about any concerns that they might have.

“I am really keen that the local community make the most of this facility and would encourage everyone in the city centre to come and say hello and have a chat.

“The pod has now been placed on Jameson Street, Hull and will be open from 9am tomorrow morning.” #HumberTalking #PartnersOnYourDoorstep
