Two men and a woman have been arrested on suspicion of burglary following a report that a Hull City Centre jewellers had been broken into in the early hours of this morning, Wednesday 7 October.

Officers quickly attended to discover a trail of watches leading away from the shop, and following enquiries in the locality, three people were arrested shortly after. The watches have been recovered.

The three remain in our custody as we continue our enquiries.
