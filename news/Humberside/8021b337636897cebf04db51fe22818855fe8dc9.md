As officers continue to support the flood hit residents of Snaith, East Cowick and Gowdall messages of thanks from Snaith Primary School have lifted the spirits of those working around the clock.

Area Commander Darren Downs said, “These thank you cards and messages of support really do make a huge difference to everyone who has been working so hard to help the devastated residents so badly hit by the ongoing flooding in the Snaith and Cowick area.

“People taking time to thank others is very heart-warming, and shows the strength of community spirit which is clear for everyone to see. The situation everyone in these villages has faced since the start of the floods last week has been unprecedented.

“Everyone from the Environment Agency, East Riding of Yorkshire Council, Humberside Fire and all the amazing volunteers have been working so hard to support residents and deal with the situation, it’s our job, but to have thanks like this means a lot to everyone involved.”
