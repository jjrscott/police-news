A 48-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs, following a warrant on Rutland Street, Grimsby yesterday afternoon (Tuesday 1 December).

The warrant came following community information that drug dealing activity had been taking place at the property.

Officers seized a quantity of wraps believed to be Class A drugs, drug paraphernalia, a number of mobile phones and tablets, plus a number of weapons such as knives and a sword.

Four high value bikes suspected of being stolen were also discovered inside the address. Enquiries are ongoing to determine where the bikes have come from and who their rightful owners are.

The man remains in custody whilst we continue our investigation.

We would encourage communities to report any suspicious or drug dealing activity in their area to us, so that we can continue to take these drugs and weapons off the streets.
