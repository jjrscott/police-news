We’re issuing some advice after a number of recent car thefts where car keys were stolen during house burglaries.

Superintendent Jenny Bristow said, “What happened in a number of recent crimes is that intruders have broken into houses, during the night while people are asleep, to steal car keys and anything else they can lay their hands on. The keys have then then used to steal cars.

“We are investigating all these offences but think it’s also helpful to remind residents of some crime prevention advice."

 * Always lock and secure your home, especially at night and to store car keys in a safe place.
 * If you are able to - keep your car locked in a garage
 * Lock garden and drive gates if you have them
 * Consider buying a good CCTV system
 * Never hang keys on the inside of a door and don’t leave keys on show or in an obvious place. Hide house and car keys within the house somewhere safe.

“If anyone sees anything suspicious, anybody looking as though they are checking a property or vehicle out, or anything out of the ordinary please contact us."

We are investigating two recent incidents which we are appealing for witnesses and information.

The first was (Log 244 09/12/19) on Salcey Close, Kingswood, between 2pm on Saturday 7 and 3.30pm on Monday 9 December where a white Kia Sportage was stolen.

The second was (Log 70 10/12/19) on Mill Beck Lane, Cottingham, between 11pm and 7am overnight Monday 9 and Tuesday 10 December where two cars, a black Lexus and a white Peugeot were stolen.

If you have any information about these two crimes or know where these cars are, call us on the non-emergency number 101 quoting the above log numbers. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. The information you provide to this independent charity could qualify you for a reward.
