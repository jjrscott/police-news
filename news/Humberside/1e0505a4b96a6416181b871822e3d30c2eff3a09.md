Whilst on proactive patrol around the East Marsh of Grimsby before 9pm last night, Wednesday 21 October, officers spotted a man with a large brown package stood leaning into a vehicle.

On spotting the officers, the vehicle drove off, but was successfully stopped on Weelsby Street with the assistance of our Roads Policing Unit. Upon searching the vehicle, a knife and large amount of suspected Class A drugs were discovered.

Two men have been arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs and possession of a bladed article.

They remain in our custody at this time as we continue our investigation.
