Officers in Grimsby have, working alongside Op Galaxy, found four cannabis grows in the past 24 hours.

We were called to reports of two burglaries in progress, on one Sixhill Street and another on Peaksfield Avenue – upon arrival officers found cannabis plants and growing equipment.

Today on Dukes Street and Wellington Street officers working under Op Galaxy served drugs warrants and found two further cannabis grows, Class B drugs and growing equipment and arrested two men.

The two men have been taken into custody today and will face questioning about the cultivation and supply of drugs.

Inspector David Stephenson said, “The cultivation and supply of drugs in our communities causes misery to the lives of others. It will not be tolerated and we make no apology for finding, dismantling and removing drugs and equipment from these properties. The work we are doing to disrupt the supply of drugs in our community is as a direct result of information supplied by residents.”
