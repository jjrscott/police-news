Over 40 guests were moved on and the householder was served with a breach of Covid 19 restrictions penalty notice at a house on Davenport Drive in Cleethorpes when officers were alerted to a party at the address in the early hours of this morning (Saturday 31 October 2020).

Neighbourhood Chief Inspector Paul French said: 'This was a reckless breach of Covid 19 regulations at a crucial time when this deadly virus is continuing to spread and harm our communities.

'The party was clearly pre-planned and had, when we arrived, over 40 people in the house. This is not only illegal, but increases the risk of infecting so many other people.

'We know this is a really difficult time for people, this is not about stopping people's fun and celebrations, it’s about saving lives.

'The vast majority of our communities are following the regulations and are making huge personal sacrifices so when this type of event comes to our attention we must take strong action against those involved.

‘I would appeal to everyone to work with us on these new restrictions and make sure they do not put themselves or others at risk of infection.

‘If we are made aware or come across blatant, and reckless, breaches such as pre-planned large parties, we will take action against the host and potentially this could lead to a £10,000 fine.’
