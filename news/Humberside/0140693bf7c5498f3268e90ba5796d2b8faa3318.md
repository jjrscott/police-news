A man suspected of trying to break into a #Scunthorpe restaurant in the early hours of this morning has ended up having breakfast with us instead.

Our eagle-eyed officers spotted a man trying to force his way into the premises on Doncaster Road, shortly before 3am today (Wednesday, 11 November).

A 23-year-old man was arrested in suspicion of burglary and remains in our custody.
