We’ve now arrested 600 people as part of Operation Galaxy – that’s 31 since 5pm on Friday!

Some have been as a result of the 132 warrants we have carried out at properties across northern Lincolnshire and East Yorkshire, which have also resulted in us seizing drugs worth millions of pounds, along with weapons, cash and luxury goods.

However, many have been in relation to other serious offences which have a huge impact on the most vulnerable in our communities, from domestic abuse and sexual offences to robberies and violent crime.

You can find out more about how our specialist teams are targeting offenders, protecting vulnerable people and keeping you safe here – along with all the latest news from Operation Galaxy.
