Jaroslav Skorpik (62) of Kesgrave Street in Grimsby was sentenced at Grimsby Crown Court on Friday 4 December to spend 12 months in jail. This is after he pleaded guilty to the offence of ‘intentionally engaging in sexual activity in a place knowing or believing that a child and would be aware of that activity.’

He appeared in court after he was arrested and charged after an incident on 23 June where he was seen in his car touching himself in a sexual way in front of two young girls.

On sentencing the court heard how Jaroslav Skorpik had previously been made the subject of a suspended sentence after a similar incident in Germany in 2014.

Investigating Officer James Carlisle said, “Protecting young and vulnerable people remains one of Humberside Police’s highest priorities.

“This sentence of 12 months in custody is also accompanied by a 10 year Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO) which prohibits him from attending play areas and parks.

“This means that he will be monitored for the duration of the SHPO by dedicated officers intent on protecting children from harm.”
