Two men were arrested on High Street, Scunthorpe yesterday (Monday 15 March), on suspicion of fraud by false representation, after a bank reported suspicious withdrawals from an elderly man’s account.

It was reported that two men completed some gutter cleaning work for the man which they charged him £5,000 in cash for. They allegedly later pressurised the man to withdraw a further £3,000 for de-weeding – thankfully this second amount was not handed over.

The men have been placed on conditional bail whilst the investigation continues.
