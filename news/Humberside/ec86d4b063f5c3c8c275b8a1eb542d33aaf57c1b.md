LGBT+ History Month, takes place in February each year and provides an opportunity to help people learn more about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender history, and promote inclusivity.

It’s important we understand the legacy of discrimination and abuse faced by the LGBT+ community and it’s crucial we learn from history and make sure we do better today. We remain committed to supporting all our communities equally and we will not tolerate hate crime.

As part of LGBT+ History Month, Stephen, our Wellbeing Co-ordinator, shared his insight….

You can report hate crime to Humberside Police, either as a victim or for someone else, on 101 or 999.

If you feel that you are not ready to speak to the police, there are other agencies you can contact to get support;

Galop – A National LGBT reporting centre

Victim Support – National reporting centre
