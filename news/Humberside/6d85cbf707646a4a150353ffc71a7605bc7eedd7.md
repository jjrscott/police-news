A teenager from Hull has been charged with burglary and the possession of cannabis following a reported break in at a property on Palmer Avenue, Willerby on Halloween (Saturday 31 October).

The 16 year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has been bailed to appeal before Hull Youth Court on Tuesday 12 January 2021.

Two bikes were reported stolen from the propertyâ€™s garage and although entry was forced to the home too, nothing was reported stolen from inside.
