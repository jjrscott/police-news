Today a misuse of drugs warrant was served at a house on Langtoft Grove off Inglemire Lane â€“ one man has been arrested in connection with the supply of Class A drugs and he remains in custody.

This follows two previous warrants on Saturday 13 February on Mayfield Street (off Spring Bank) where three people were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class B drugs, and on Friday 5 February on Ripley Close (near Greenwood Avenue) where a man was arrested on suspicion of the supply of Class A and B drugs.

As a result of these three warrants a large amount of drugs has been taken off our streets and cash has been seized.

The supply of illegal drugs has a severe and negative impact on our communities. If you have information about those involved in the supply of drugs speak to your local police officers or call 101.

If you wish to remain anonymous you can call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
