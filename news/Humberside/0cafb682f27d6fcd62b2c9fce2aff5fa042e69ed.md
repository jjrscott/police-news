_You’ll no doubt have seen the pictures and videos of our teams carrying out warrants, seizing drugs and weapons and making arrests._

_But Operation Galaxy is about much more than that._

_We also target those who commit serious sexual offences against adults and children, domestic abuse and those who exploit others for their own gain, our teams are helping to protect some of the most vulnerable people in our communities._

_Today, as we continue Lifting The Police Tape on the work of our teams, **Detective Chief Inspector Rich Osgerby** explains more about what we mean by protecting vulnerable people and how we keep you safe._

“In the Protecting Vulnerable People Unit we investigate crimes that can be life changing for the victims.

“From rape and serious sexual offences to child abuse and domestic abuse, these are offences which have a huge impact on people’s lives, including their mental and physical wellbeing and the wellbeing of their families.

“What’s most important for us is that when someone come forwards to tell us what has happened to them, they know we are here for them and we will support them through the investigation in a caring and sensitive way.

“The unit is made up of specialist officers and our biggest priority is to ensure that victims are safe and that we work with partners to will do all we can to prevent further abuse and bring offenders to justice.

“Our role is exactly the same with Operation Galaxy. We are here to protect the most vulnerable members of our society, pursue the perpetrators of offences and prevent our victims from feeling unsafe or falling victim to abuse or exploitation in the future.

“Over the next month, one of our main priorities will be helping young people who are at risk of being exploited or who are in circumstances which make them vulnerable.

“As part of the latest phase of the operation, our outreach teams will be going out with our colleagues from the four local authorities and charities, speaking to young people at risk of exploitation in key locations.

“As well as giving them safety advice, we can also find out more about the situations they are finding themselves in, what and who are the risks to them and give them an opportunity to talk to us about anything – or anyone – that’s causing them concern.

“This will allow us to put extra safeguarding measures in place to protect those young people.

“We will also be working with hotels in the force area to give them advice on how to spot the signs of exploitation and how to report it to us.”

Another arm of our Protecting Vulnerable People Unit is our missing team.

This dedicated team’s focus is on working with partners and our patrol teams to locate people who are missing as quickly as possible, to identify any underlying issues which have led to someone going missing – and what can be done to resolve them to prevent them going missing again.

We also have a team of specially trained officers in the PVP unit that are responsible for the management of violent and sexual offenders in the community.

These officers also work with partners and the offenders themselves to ensure that Sexual Harm Prevention Order conditions and license conditions are adhered to and any breaches are enforced, to keep our communities safe.

All these teams will play a vital role in Operation Galaxy.

DCI Osgerby said: “Our teams are made up of a large number of officers and police staff across all ranks and they all share a passion and commitment for protecting vulnerable people and taking action against those who would try to abuse or exploit them.

“If you have any information about any crimes of this nature, please get in touch and report it to us. We will listen to you and carry out a full and thorough investigation.

“You can report information by calling our non-emergency 101 number or anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers 0800 555 111. In an emergency, always call 999.”
