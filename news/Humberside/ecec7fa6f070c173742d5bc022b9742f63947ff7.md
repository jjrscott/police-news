Following his sentencing at Hull Crown Court on Friday 19 February, Simas Zalys has been sentenced to two years and four months in jail for cultivating cannabis at a house off Anlaby Road.

He was arrested when Op Galaxy officers, working alongside the local neighbourhood team, executed a drugs warrant at a house on St Matthew Street near Boulevard in Hull on Sunday 6 December 2020.

When officers entered the address they found nearly 400 cannabis plants with commercial growing equipment and an electricity supply that had been diverted from another property.

Zalys was found in a living space at the rear of the house and later charged with production a controlled Class B drug (Cannabis) and with abstracting electricity without authority.

Speaking on sentencing Op Galaxy lead Chief Superintendent Darren Downs said; “The cultivation of cannabis in a residential street like this causes untold misery to those living and working nearby.

“We continue to gather information from members of the public and I would continue to encourage people to keep giving us this valuable information.

“Anyone with information about drugs being grown in their communities can call us on our non-emergency number 101 and quote Op Galaxy."
