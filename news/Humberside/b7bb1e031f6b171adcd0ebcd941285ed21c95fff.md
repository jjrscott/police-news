Mark Jewitt (25) of Constable Street, Hull has today been sentenced to serve a minimum term of 15 years in prison for the murder of his neighbour 57 year-old Vera Hudson at her home on Constable Street in Hull on Thursday 19 September 2019.

Officers were called to Constable Street shortly after 7.30am on Thursday 19 September 2019. The body of a woman was found at the address and a murder investigation commenced. Mark Jewitt, of Constable Street was charged last September with the offence and pleaded guilty in court in February.

Senior Investigating Officer in the case, Detective Chief Inspector Phil Gadd said: “When Mark Jewitt took the life of Vera Hudson last September he devastated her family and friends. They have been very stoic throughout the legal process and in the face of what is unimaginable grief.

“I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved in bringing Mark Jewitt to justice and hope this sentence will help provide some closure to Vera’s family. This term in jail will give Mark Jewittt time to consider his rash actions which lead to Vera’s death."
