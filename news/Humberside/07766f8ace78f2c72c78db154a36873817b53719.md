A man has been sentenced to 12 months imprisonment at Grimsby Crown Court for breaching the terms of his sexual offender notification requirements. Officers discovered he had breached the terms and charged him with the offence.

Previously convicted for historical child sex offences and ordered to sign the sex offenders register Mark Howarth, 58, Littlecoates Road, Grimsby, failed to notify police that he had travelled to London where he stayed at a friend’s house where a child under the age of 16 lived.

Investigation Officer James Carlisle said “The Humberside Police Sex Offender Monitoring unit (MOSOVO) will bring to justice any sex offender who we believe are not complying with the terms of their orders."

“Any breaches are dealt with promptly and effectively in order to protect the community from harm.”
