A 25-year-old man has been arrested after a car he was travelling in failed to stop for one of our vehicles in #Hull last night.
The black Audi A3 was spotted by officers at 9.46pm and swiftly brought safely to a stop in Marfleet Lane within three minutes of being sighted.
Three men were arrested at the scene but two have since been released without charge.
The 25-year-old remains in our custody on suspicion of dangerous driving; failing to stop; attempted theft of a motor vehicle; drink driving; supplying a controlled drug; fraud and forgery and driving without a licence.
