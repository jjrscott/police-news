Three men were arrested just after 12.30am this morning (Monday 16 November) on Malm Street, Hull, after a car spotted driving dangerously at speed crashed into another two cars.

Following a short pursuit, a 32-year-old man, 29-year-old man and 23-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, failing to stop and theft of a motor vehicle. The 29-year-old man was also arrested on suspicion of driving whilst disqualified and being under the influence of drink or drugs.

Thankfully the two vehicles hit were parked and no-one was hurt.

The men remain in our custody whilst our investigation continues.
