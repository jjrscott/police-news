Officers from our Op Galaxy team have been successful in seizing a large amount of drugs and cash this week after carrying out warrants at two addresses.

On Wednesday 13 January, officers carried out a warrant on Spencer Avenue, Scunthorpe which resulted in the recovery of what is suspected to be Â£2000 worth of cocaine and heroin and a quantity of cash.

Yesterday, Thursday 14 January officers working in partnership with Hull East Neighbourhood Policing team executed another Misuse of Drugs Act warrant on Saxby Road, Hull which resulted in a large quantity of drugs, cash, phones, weapons and Nitrous oxide canisters being seized.

As a result of the two warrants, two men are currently in custody assisting us with our enquiries and a man, a woman, and two teenage boys were arrested and subsequently released under investigation.

Your local teams are continuing their action against drugs in your area and continue to encourage anyone with information relating to the production of cannabis, or any drug, to call 101 and report it to us.
