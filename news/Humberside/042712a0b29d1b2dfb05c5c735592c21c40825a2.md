Investigations have been launched following the discovery of two cannabis grows in Grimsby and Cleethorpes yesterday, Tuesday 23 February.

A sophisticated cannabis grow of approximately 200 plants was discovered in the attic of a property on Poplar Road, Cleethorpes at approximately 5pm.

A cannabis grow of approximately 1200 seedling plants were discovered inside a property on Church Street, Grimsby shortly before 8.45pm.

Enquiries are ongoing to determine those responsible for both grows. They had both been dangerously extracting electricity, something that is common with cannabis grows, which can put local residents at risk of harm.

We will continue to take action against drugs being produced and sold in our communities.

If you have any information that could assist with our investigations into these grows, or wish to report drug activity in your local area, please call our non-emergency number 101.
