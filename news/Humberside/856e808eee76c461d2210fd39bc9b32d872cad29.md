Three men and a woman are in custody after our eagle-eyed teams recovered a stolen car just 90 minutes after it was reported stolen from a house in Brigg.

We were called at 12.35pm on Thursday, 19, November, when thieves forced their way into the property and stole the keys to a silver Mercedes before driving away in the vehicle.

The car was abandoned by the thieves and four people were arrested in connection with the theft a short time later after being spotted by our officers.

A 33-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of burglary and assisting an offender; two men aged 22 and 28 were arrested on suspicion of burglary and a 22-year-old woman on suspicion of burglary, assisting an offender and possession of cannabis.

All four remain in our custody at this time.
