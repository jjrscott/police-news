The 25-year-old man arrested yesterday (Wednesday, 21 August) on suspicion of the murder of Libby Squire has been released under investigation as further enquiries continue.

The Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Superintendent Martin Smalley, said: “Proceedings are active and I would remind people to please refrain from any speculation, as the investigation is very much live and continuing.

“There are further enquiries still being carried out and there are constant investigative developments and procedures that are ongoing.

“The majority of the additional analysis stage is now complete, with a small number still pending final results. A file is being prepared for the Crown Prosecution Service as the investigation progresses.

“My heartfelt thanks go out to Libby’s parents for their continued understanding and patience.

"They have been kept informed of all the developments in the investigation and they will always maintain our support.”
