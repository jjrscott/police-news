Two boys have been arrested on suspicion of theft after a stolen motorbike was recovered from Hutt Street, Hull, in the early hours of this morning, Thursday 17 December.

Around 2:45am, a member of the public spotted two teenagers acting suspiciously and attempting to snap the registration plates off a bike.

The two teenagers remain in custody at this time whilst enquiries continue.

Officers are doing everything they can to determine the owner of the bike, so they can be reunited with whatâ€™s rightfully theirs.
