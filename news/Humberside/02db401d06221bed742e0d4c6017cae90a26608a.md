Officers have carried out a warrant at an address on Everest Road, Ashby this morning following reported concerns and information from the local community.

We seized a quantity of what are thought to be class A and class B drugs, as well as weapons and cash.

Local Neighbourhood Inspector Mark Fletcher said: “Our communities have been telling us about the things that are causing them concern and I hope today’s activity shows that we are listening and we are taking action.

“This is a great result today, with drugs and weapons taken off our area’s streets.

“I would like to take this opportunity to encourage people to keep talking to us and sharing information and concerns.

“Your reports help us to build up a picture of what is going on enabling us to take action where required – such as today’s warrant.”

You can report information by calling our non-emergency 101 line or anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
