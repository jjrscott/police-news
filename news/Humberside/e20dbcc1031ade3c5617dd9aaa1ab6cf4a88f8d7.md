BARBU, Cristian.jpgDownload

On the 10 August 2019 we received a report that HGV driver Christian Barbu from Romania had not disembarked from the Pride of Hull following a trip with his HGV from Rotterdam to Hull.

Christian boarded the P&O ferry in Rotterdam on Friday 9 August. On Saturday 10 August his vehicle and belongings remained on the ship but he was nowhere to be found.

We issued a missing person appeal to try and find him or information about his whereabouts but a year on there has been no further news and Christian has not been found.

We are appealing once again for anyone with information about the Christian to contact us.

If you have any information that would help with our enquiries please call us on 101 quoting log 313 of 10 August 2019.
