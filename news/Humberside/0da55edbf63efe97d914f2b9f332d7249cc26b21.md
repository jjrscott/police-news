We are aware of a video circulating on social media appearing to show a man spitting on a charity bag before posting it through a letterbox in Kirk Ella yesterday, Tuesday 10 November.

We can confirm this has been reported to us and an investigation has been launched to try and prevent further incidents.

This has also been reported to the charity who we will keep in contact with, as clearly this is unacceptable.

We would advise the public who may have received these bags to take precautions when handling these items.

Patrols have been door knocking in the area to provide reassurance and we would encourage anyone with concerns to speak to them.

We would also ask anyone who believes they have experienced the same and has CCTV footage to contact us on our non-emergency number 101 quoting log 112 of today, 11 November.
