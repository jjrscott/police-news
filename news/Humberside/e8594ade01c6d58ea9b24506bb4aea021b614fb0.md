Four men have been arrested by our #OpGalaxy team today (Friday 8 January) at a property on North Parade in Ashby, Scunthorpe, on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A and B drugs. Two were further arrested on suspicion of cultivating cannabis, one on suspicion of importing a controlled drug and one on suspicion of assaulting an officer.

A quantity of white powder (thought to be Class A drugs) and cannabis as well as, a large quantity of cash and mobile phones have been seized.

Our investigations are ongoing and the four men remain in our custody.
