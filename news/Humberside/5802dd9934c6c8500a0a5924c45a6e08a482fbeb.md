Officers have recovered 300 cannabis plants from a flat in Newstead Street, Hull, which had been converted into a cannabis factory.

Officers remain at the scene of the grow, where two rooms had been given over to the cultivation of the plants.

The power supply had also been tampered with and has now been made safe.

At this stage, no arrests have been made and weâ€™re working to trace those responsible for the operation.

If you have information that could assist us, please call us on 101, quoting log number 332 of 12 January.
