A man has sadly died following a single vehicle collision on the A63 in Hull this morning.

We were called at 8.42am today (Friday, 11 December) following reports a white Transit van had collided with railings at the junction with Castle Street and Market Place.

Sadly, the driver of the van – whose family have asked is not publically identified – was pronounced dead at hospital.

An investigation has been launched into the circumstances of the collision and we are appealing for anyone with information or dashcam footage to get in touch.

If you can help, please call our non-emergency 101 line, quoting log number 87 of 11 December.
