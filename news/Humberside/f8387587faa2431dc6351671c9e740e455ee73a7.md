On Thursday 25 March, shortly before 9pm, we were made aware of a reported burglary to a property on Laneham Street in Scunthorpe.

Officers arrived shortly after and one man was arrested on suspicion of burglary.

Thankfully no one was injured and nothing believed to be stolen, but damage has been caused to the windows.

The man remains in our custody whilst our investigations are ongoing.
