Following reports of a party of over 20 people at a property on Cavendish Road, Hull yesterday evening (Saturday 31 October), the householder has been served with a fixed penalty notice for breaching Covid 19 restrictions.

Assistant Chief Constable Paul Anderson said: “As has been our approach throughout the pandemic, the attending officers at the property engaged, explained and encouraged the householder to comply with the restrictions set out to keep us safe.

“After failing to cooperate with this approach, over 20 people were dispersed from the address and the householder was served with a fixed penalty notice this morning (Sunday 1 November).

“Gatherings like this not only cause nuisance to neighbours by the loud noise and anti-social behaviour that come with them, but are illegal and increase the risk of infecting so many others.

“We know that people are frustrated and want to celebrate occasions such as Halloween, but this deadly virus is spreading and we must all play our part in following the restrictions laid out to keep each other safe.

“Most people within our Force area have been very good at following the regulations, but we will continue to take action against those that are recklessly endangering other people within our communities.

“We must all remember that our actions don’t only affect ourselves, and I would appeal for everyone to behave responsibly and be considerate to others.”
