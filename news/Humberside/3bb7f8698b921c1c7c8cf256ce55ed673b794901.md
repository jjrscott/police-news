title: Judgement in High Court Judicial Review | Humberside Police

```

We accept the Judgeâ€™s decision today and his findings in the Judicial Review.

The mere recording of the incident by Humberside Police as a hate incident has been ruled as not unlawful and in accordance with the College of Policing (CoP) guidance.

Our actions in handling the incident were carried out in good faith but we note the comments of the Judge and we will take learning from this incident moving forward.

The CoP guidance is currently being revised and will hopefully offer further clarity to Forces as to the handling of hate incidents.

We will always take hate related offences and reports seriously as they can cause extreme distress to victims and communities, some of whom are incredibly vulnerable members of our society, and people should not suffer in silence.
