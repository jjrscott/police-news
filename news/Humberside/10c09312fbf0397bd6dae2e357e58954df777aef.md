Yesterday morning (Thursday 5 November) proactive East Riding patrol officers, supported by #OpGalaxy, descended on an address on Scotts Garth Drive in Tickton to discover a large cannabis grow of almost 650 plants.

The plants were at various stages of growth, occupying almost every room in the property and are believed to have an estimated street value of almost Â£400k.

As common with cannabis grows in residential properties, the electricity had been dangerously tampered with, putting those around the house at risk.

Enquiries are ongoing to determine those responsible and we would ask anyone with information to contact us on our non-emergency number 101, quoting log 136 of 5 November, or alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
