Pawel Relowicz, 26, has been sentenced to spend life with a minimum of 27 years in prison for the rape and murder of Libby Squire.

This comes following a four-and-a-half week trial and over 27 hours of jury deliberations.

The court had heard how Pawel Relowicz picked Libby up in his car, took her to Oak Road Playing Fields and tragically, raped and killed her. A combination of CCTV, witness testimony, forensic evidence (DNA), Pawel Relowicz’s changing testimony and previous offending history, presented an extremely compelling case which the jury were able to come to their own conclusions from.
