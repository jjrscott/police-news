A closure notice has been served and placed today at a property on Great Thornton Street, Hull.

The occupants are required to attend Hull Magistrates Court on 1 Oct 2019 to appeal the notice.

Inspector Julian Hart said, “The address is connected with drug dealing of class A drugs and the source of numerous reports by neighbours of anti-social behaviour.

“We have stepped up foot patrols at the Great Thornton Street flats and gathered information from residents. We have taken enforcement action by exercising drugs warrants and arresting offenders.

“We have worked closely with the neighbourhood nuisance team but have taken the lead due to the criminal conduct at the address.”
