Following a fatal road traffic collision between a car and motorbike on Staithes Road, Preston just before 7.15am yesterday morning, Tuesday 2 March, we are now able to name the motorcyclist who sadly died as 59 year old local man Stephen Chapman.

Mr Chapman leaves behind a loving wife and family and they have asked for their privacy to be respected at this difficult time, whilst they are dealing with their loss.

Our enquiries are continuing into the collision involving a dark silver Vauxhall Astra which is alleged to have ventured onto the wrong side of the road, colliding with the blue Yamaha motorcycle being ridden by Mr Chapman.

A 33 year old man who was arrested following the collision on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving has been released under investigation whilst our enquiries continue.

We are appealing for any witnesses who have not yet spoken to us to get in touch. If you saw either the collision itself, the vehicles prior to the collision or anyone nearby behaving in a suspicious manner after the collision, please call our non-emergency number 101 quoting log 48 of 2 March.
