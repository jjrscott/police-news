We have received a call from the parent of a young teenage girl who had reported that two men driving a ‘long black car’ had approached the her and her friend while they were on Holderness Road.

The girl and her friend were walking along Holderness Road near Laburnum Avenue shortly before 9pm on Tuesday 29 December when two men driving a long black car had stopped near them and waved them over.

The girls in this incident did the right thing and went straight to a place of safety where a member of the public helped them. They told their parents straight away who contacted us.

We would want parents to be aware of this type of incident and advise their children to be aware not alarmed and always tell their parents if they feel threatened or vulnerable.

Anyone with information about this incident should call our non-emergency number 101 quoting log 550 of 29 December 2020.
