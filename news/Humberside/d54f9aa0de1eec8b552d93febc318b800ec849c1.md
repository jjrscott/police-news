Officers from our Op Galaxy team have seized an estimated Â£25,000 worth of cannabis from a property in High Santon, North Lincolnshire today, Friday 25 September.

A warrant was carried out at the address where a number of cannabis plants were found along with a large quantity of dried cannabis.

The search was done out as part of ongoing investigations after drugs were found in the boot of a vehicle that was stopped by our Roads Crime Team on the Humber Bridge yesterday evening, Thursday 24 September.

A man was arrested following the vehicle stop, he remains in our custody whilst enquiries continue.
