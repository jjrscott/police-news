A teenage boy has been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage following a rooftop siege on Fairfield Road, Hull this afternoon (Sunday 31 January).

A road closure had been put in place for the safety of the local residents and our team. This has now been lifted.

Thank you to everyone for their patience whilst this incident was brought to a safe conclusion.
