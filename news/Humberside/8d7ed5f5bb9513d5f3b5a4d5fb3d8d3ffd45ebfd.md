Following our appeal for witnesses to reports of a man following and attempting to grab an 11-year-old boy in Snaith, we have now arrested a man on suspicion of attempted abduction.

The incident was reported to have occurred on Monday 15 March, at approximately 5:45pm, on the field on Pontefract Road in Snaith.

The boy was unharmed as he ran home, but was understandably shaken by the incident.

Detective Inspector Andy Crawforth from CID said: “I want to reassure those in the local area that our teams are continuing to patrol and we have also undertaken door to door and CCTV enquiries.

“I want to thank those who have come forward to assist with our investigation.”

The man remains in our custody whilst our investigation is ongoing.

Anyone with any information, who has not yet spoken to us, is asked to call our non-emergency number 101 quoting 16/31020/21.
