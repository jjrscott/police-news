We are appealing to help locate the next of kin for 54 year old Ian Sumner.

Ian lived on Westcott Street, Hull, but sadly died at his home on Saturday 23 January. He also has links to Stretford, where he was born, and Wigan as he lived there previously.

His death is not being treated as suspicious and despite extensive work we have not been able to locate Ianâ€™s next of kin.

If you can help us please call our non-emergency number 101 quoting log 133 of 23 January 2021.
