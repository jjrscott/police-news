A Grimsby man who threatened and abused two of our PCSOs in an unprovoked attack has been fined £850.

Matthew O’Hara, 41, of Lord Street, was convicted of using threatening or abusive behaviour when he appeared before Grimsby Magistrates Court on Monday, 30 November.

The court heard the two PCSOs going about their normal duty of protecting the communities of Grimsby East when they were subjected to an unprovoked barrage of disturbing abuse from the man on Park Street.

His attack was captured on body worn video and shown to the court – however, due to the nature of the language he used, it’s not appropriate for us to share it here.

Sergeant Dan Healey said: “Whilst as police officers it is expected and understood that we will accept a certain level of negative language being used towards us, after reviewing the body worn video covering this incident, it was extremely distressing to watch and action needed to be taken.

“Our PCSOs are there to engage with and protect the community and should not find themselves subjected to this kind of abusive language.

“I hope the outcome of this case helps the man to reflect on his actions and think more wisely before acting in this way again, and shows others that we can and will take action against other similar incidents.”
