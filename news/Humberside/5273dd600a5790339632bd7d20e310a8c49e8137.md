Following another successful misuse of drugs act warrant yesterday, Monday 7 September, the Hull Central Neighbourhood team have taken in excess of £120k worth of mature cannabis plants off the streets of Hull from a property on Spring Bank West.

Local Beat Manager PC Tim McGowan said: “I would like to thank the community for continuing to support our action against drugs in the city.

“We want to provide reassurance that we will continue to take enforcement action and investigate those committing criminal offences such as the production or supply of drugs.

“These setups are causing our communities harm, so we will always look to dismantle them.

“They often tamper with electrical supplies which can put neighbouring residents in danger; something we simply can’t tolerate.

“The plants have all been seized to allow us to continue with our investigation to identify those responsible.

“I would encourage the community to continue to engage with us and provide us with the invaluable information that allows us to take drugs off of our streets.

“This can be done via our non-emergency number 101, through local officers or by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 if you wish to remain anonymous.”
