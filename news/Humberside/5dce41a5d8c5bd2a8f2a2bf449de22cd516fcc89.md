A 34-year-old man has been charged after an officer was assaulted whilst on duty yesterday, Thursday 1 October.

The officer was responding to reports of a disturbance in Goole when a man bit his hand, breaking the skin and causing an injury.

Terrance Scott, of Cottingham Street, Goole was arrested and has since been charged with assault causing actual bodily harm in connection with the incident, as well as multiple other offences.

He was remanded in custody to appear at Hull Magistrates Court today, Friday 2 October.

Deputy Chief Constable Chris Rowley said: “Our officers put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities and keep our streets safe.

“Underneath their uniforms they are real people with families and friends and they do not come to work to be assaulted.

“Incidents of this nature are wholly unacceptable and we will always do everything we can to support our officers and put suspects before the courts.”
