The Neighbourhood Policing Team conducted three search warrants on Thursday 4 February, which lead to two men being arrested on suspicion of possession of a controlled drug with intent to supply.

Upon searching two properties, one on Ellerburn Avenue and the other on Ripley Close, officers discovered and seized a quantity of amphetamine, cannabis, cash and mobile phones.

The two men remain in our custody whilst we progress our investigations.

The Neighbourhood Policing Sergeant says: “These warrants have been a step in the right direction to targeting organised crime and the long standing anti-social behaviour on the estate.

“We know how frustrating this is for local residents and it is a priority within our force. We want everyone to feel safe within their own homes and the Force area.

“We regularly call on the support of our communities, so if you think you may have any information relating to anti-social behaviour or drug related crime in your area, please come forward and tell us.

“You can pass information onto us by calling our non-emergency number 101, or if you would prefer to stay anonymous, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
