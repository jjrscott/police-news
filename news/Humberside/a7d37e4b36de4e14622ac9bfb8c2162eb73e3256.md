Two vehicle stops in Bridlington yesterday (Tuesday 16 March) resulted in three arrests for a number of offences.

The local sergeant spotted a vehicle that had been recently reported stolen travelling on the A614 through Bessinby, Bridlington shortly before 12pm. With the help of the Roads Policing Team, the vehicle was stopped on the Driffield bypass.

A 40-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of burglary, criminal damage, breach of a restraining order, five road traffic offences including drug driving, and as being wanted on prison recall. A second man was arrested on suspicion of burglary and theft of a motor vehicle.

They remain in our custody at this time.

In a separate intelligence led stop also on the A614 by our Roads Crime Team, shortly before 1pm, a 25-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of drug driving. He has been released under investigation whilst enquiries continue.

We will continue to take action against those using our roads for criminality.
