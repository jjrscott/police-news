Action was taken against three anti-social vehicle drivers on Kings Road, Cleethorpes this Sunday 14 March, after reports of the vehicles ‘drag racing’ around the roundabout, sounding their horns continuously and disrupting vehicles trying to legitimately use the roads.

The area is covered by a Public Spaces Protection Order under the local authority, aiming to protect the local community from those intent on causing nuisance or harm.

Officers attended the report and one of the drivers had his vehicle seized. The other two of the drivers were issued section 59 notices, meaning should they be caught again, their vehicles would also be seized. The cases have been referred to the local authority under the protection order.

Community Beat Manager PC Dave Cave said: “We understand the detrimental effect anti-social behaviour and nuisance vehicles can have on the community, which is why we’re dedicated to disrupting those involved and working with our partners on longer term solutions to problems.

“If you witness people driving anti-socially and putting others at risk, please contact us on 101, or 999 in an emergency, and we will take appropriate action.”
