Following a warrant at a property in Withernwick, a 35-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and money laundering.

We seized a total of £2,000 in cash, a transit van, a VW transporter van and approximately £35,000 worth of property including; a juke box, tools, furniture, designer goods, electrical items and a drugs press.

The man has been released under investigation whilst our enquiries continue.
