Following a successful warrant executed on Windsor Court, Grimsby yesterday, Thursday 10 September, four people have been arrested.

Two women and two men have been arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs. They have been released under investigation whilst our enquiries continue.

Upon searching the property we discovered and seized suspected crack cocaine, heroin and spice, cash, drug paraphernalia and multiple mobile phones.

We would encourage anyone who has information regarding drug dealing in their area to get in touch with us on our non-emergency number 101. We will continue to take action against those intent on causing our communities harm.
