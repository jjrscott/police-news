The new Yorkshire and The Humber (YaTH) regional Marine and Underwater Unit boat was officially launched on Saturday 29 September at Hull Marina, with dozens of people turning up to see the new vessel and to speak with our officers.

Senior leaders from the regional Yorkshire forces along with our partner agencies were there on what turned out to be a glorious sunny day next to the River Humber.

The boat will benefit the region both on the surface and underwater for at least the next 25 years.

We want to say thank you to everyone who turned up. It was great to meet you all and we hope you had a good day.

Photographs from the launch can be found as attachments.
