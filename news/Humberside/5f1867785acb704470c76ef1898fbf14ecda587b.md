We’ve seen an increase in the number of drivers being dealt with for drug driving and speeding offences on our roads in recent weeks.

Since the start of the year 45 people have been arrested following a positive roadside drugs test and we’ve seen an increase in speeding offences with one driver being dealt with for hitting 147mph in a 50mph limit!

One driver who was arrested late last year was subsequently found to have a significant amount of cocaine in their system.

Chief Inspector James Glansfield said: “There is no excuse for some road users to be putting others at risk. The consequences of driving at speed or driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol can be significant and go far beyond just losing your licence and receiving a fine. A criminal record for these offences can result in you losing your job, isolating yourself from friends and family and can result in causing serious injury or even death to yourself or innocent road users.

“Until the 29th March journeys should be essential only and we continue to have a visible presence on our roads, looking for dangerous drivers to reduce causalities.”
