This morning, Tuesday 14 July, officers working as part of #OpGalaxy conducted a number of warrants in Withernsea in connection with the Misuse of Drugs Act, based on information from local communities. Our proactive task force along with your Neighbourhood Police Officers have visited your area recently to tackle crime to ensure we keep you safe and protect our communities.

Chief Superintendent Darren Downs: "Criminality will not be tolerated and our priority is to take these offenders off the streets and protect the most vulnerable in our society.

"Please talk with our Neighbourhood Policing Teams over any concerns you have.

"The warrants have helped us to continue our battle to disrupt organised crime with one man arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class B drugs."

If you have any information about crime in your area please contact us on our non-emergency 101 line or anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. In an emergency always dial 999.
