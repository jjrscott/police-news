The man who was sadly found dead in Ennerdale, Hull, yesterday has been named as 17-year-old local man Connor Lyons.

We were called at 8.20am yesterday following the discovery of Mr Lyon’s body on the bank of the River Hull.

Today, officers are continuing to investigate the circumstances of Mr Lyon’s death, which is being treated as unexplained.

A post mortem examination is due to take place today and we’re supporting his family at this very difficult time.

Out of respect for Mr Lyons and his family, we ask that you do not speculate about the circumstances of his death online.

If you have information that could assist our investigation, please call our non-emergency 101 line, quoting log number 80 of 19 January.
