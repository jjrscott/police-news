_(For best effect, sing this to the tune of 12 Days of Christmas)_

In the second week of action of Op Galaxy

14 warrants

69 arrested

18 charged

Five locked up

And £267K of drugs seized.

Right, that’s enough singing, but we’re happy to say that once again the team has relentless in tracking down and arresting criminals attempting to operate in our area.

When combined with our activity as part of Operation Galaxy last week, we have now made a total of 157 arrests, resulting in 45 people being charged with offences ranging from dealing in class A drugs to domestic abuse.

This week alone, we have seized heroin and cocaine valued at £16,780 and cannabis valued at £250,000.

And it has also brought further results from the courts as the cases of more of those arrested last week have been heard.

As part of our continued pledge to give you advice and tips on keeping you and your family safe this Christmas, we have also been sharing details on how to spot the signs of child sexual exploitation and how to avoid falling victim to online scams.

Chief Superintendent Darren Downs said: “The primary aim of Operation Galaxy has always been to keep you safe and my commitment to you is that we will continue to do all we can to keep that promise.

“As you can see from the list of those who have been charged or appeared in court this week, the people we’re targeting are those we believe are responsible for committing offences which cause real harm to our communities - offences such as burglary, drug dealing, domestic abuse, robbery and assault.

“It may be Christmas next week but for our teams it will be business as usual, so if you’re involved in crime it might be us rather than Santa that’s dropping in to see you.”
