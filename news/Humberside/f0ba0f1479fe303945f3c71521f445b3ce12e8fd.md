A man is in custody this afternoon after a warrant was served at a house on Southfield Road in Ashby.

Officers conducting the warrant discovered what they believed to be two stolen quad bikes, five stolen motorbikes along with drugs and cash.

The man remains in custody on suspicion of possession of drugs with intent to supply and money laundering.

Community Policing Inspector Mark Fletcher said, “Motorcycle anti-social behaviour is one of the key problems in the Scunthorpe ward areas. This warrant has discovered a number of bikes that, if not already causing a problem in the area, most likely would have been used to blight the lives of residents either through crime or anti-social behaviour.

“Our continued efforts to tackle motorcycle crime with #OpYellowfin has had a number of recent success locally and this will please many of the local residents who raise this as a major concern to them when we are out conducting our #HumberTalking surveys.

“I would continue to appeal for anyone with information about stolen bikes being kept at addresses or any criminal activity to contact us, together we can bring these people to justice and make our communities safer for everyone.”

Anyone with information about crime, anti-social behaviour or drugs being dealt in their area can call us on our non-emergency number 101.
