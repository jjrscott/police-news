A 36-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of being involved in dealing class A drugs in Scunthorpe.

The arrest came after officers monitoring Everest Road playing fields for nuisance motorbikes saw a bike being driven erratically at around 1.30pm yesterday (Thursday, 17 December).

When officers attempted to take the riderâ€™s details, he fled the scene but the bike was spotted a short time later leaving an address in Bottesford Avenue.

Officers stopped the bike and a man was arrested on suspicion of being in possession of class A drugs with intent to supply, failing to stop for police, theft of a motor vehicle, driving under the influence of drugs and driving without insurance.

The 36-year-old has been released under investigation, pending further enquiries.

If you have information you believe could assist our investigation, please call our non-emergency 101 line, quoting log number 220 of 17 December.
