A closure order has been imposed on a property on Victoria Road in Bridlington, following antisocial behaviour in the area.

This closure order was granted on Wednesday 10 February at Hull Magistrates Court.

Neighbourhood Community Beat Manager, PC Zoe Messenger, said: “I want to thank all of the local residents for continuing to report antisocial behaviour and criminal activity, and to the partner agencies for their support in the closure.

“We are aware of how crime of this nature, in your local area, can impact your sense of safety and wellbeing. Due to this, it’s not something we’re prepared to tolerate.

“With the help of the community we are able to continue to take action like this, targeting those who cause harm and disruption.

“If you’re concerned about something that’s happening near you, please get in touch and let us know.

“You can speak to our team whilst we’re out and about, or you can call our non-emergency line 101.

“If you wish to remain anonymous, please call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
