Do you recognise these men?

We want to speak to them in connection with an ongoing investigation into reports of an attempted robbery on the B1203 between Binbrook and East Ravendale on Wednesday, 7 October.

It’s reported that shortly after 6.45pm, a man was driving along the road when a dark coloured saloon-style car with lights in the grill flashed at him.

Both vehicles pulled over and two men got out of the saloon car, approached the vehicle and threatened the man, who was able to drive away. However, he was left very shaken by the incident.

Detective Inspector Tom Kelly said: “At this point in time we have not received any reports of similar incidents but we’re anxious to establish the circumstances of what happened and find the men responsible.

“We have been following up a number of lines of enquiry but are now appealing for your help in identifying these men.

“If you believe you recognise either of them, please get in touch.

“Similarly, we are also appealing for help in finding out where their distinctive facemasks are being sold.

“If you can help, please call our non-emergency 101 line, quoting log number 445 of 7 October. If you’d rather not give your name, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.”
