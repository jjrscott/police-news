Six men were arrested yesterday after officers were called to reports of three vehicles being driven dangerously at St Andrew’s Quay, Hull.

We were called at 10.25am yesterday (Thursday, 1 October) by concerned members of the public.

When our teams arrived the occupants of the vehicles – a Mini, Ford Focus and Ford Fiesta – scattered, abandoning the cars.

But, with a little help from our canine colleagues in @HPDogSection, six suspects were soon tracked down and in our custody.

Four men aged 18, 20, 22 and 24 were arrested on suspicion of theft of motor vehicle.

A 21-year-old was arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle and possession of class B or C drugs, while a 20-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply drugs other than class A and theft of a motor vehicle.

All six have been released under investigation, pending further enquiries.
