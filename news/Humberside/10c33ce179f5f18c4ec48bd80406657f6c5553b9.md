Two drugs warrants were served in Hull this week following information leading us to addresses on Houghton Walk and on Garrowby Walk off Priory Road in Hull.

A drugs warrant was served on Houghton Walk on Tuesday 1 September, where a man was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class B drugs. David Gelder (31) of Houghton Walk has subsequently been charged with possession of cannabis and has been bailed to appear at Hull Magistrates on 5 October 2020.

A second warrant was served at a house on Garrowby Walk on Wednesday 2 September, where a man was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply prescription drugs. He has been released as we continue our investigations.

Officers patrolling the area on Tuesday evening also uncovered drugs being grown at a property on Meltonby Avenue, again off Priory Road.

At all properties drugs and equipment were seized.

Anyone with information about drugs being grown or dealt in their communities can call our non-emergency number 101. We investigate all information received and can reassure our communities that we will not tolerate drugs being grown or dealt on our streets.
