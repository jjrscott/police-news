Last Wednesday (28 October) officers from Hull Central Neighbourhood Police Team executed a drugs warrant at an address on Witham, Holderness Road. The warrant was served following information from the local community about their suspicions of cannabis being grow in the premises.

PC Tim McGowan, leading the operation said, “A substantial cannabis factory was discovered at the address which spanned four floors and had a sophisticated ventilation, heating and watering system in place. We have dismantled the factory, seizing the equipment and drugs, which will be destroyed.

“The sizeable amount of cannabis was ready to flood the streets of Hull and due to our enforcement work this was recovered. A man was arrested and charged in connection with incident.

“I want to thank the community for their continued help and information and hope that they see the benefits from our disruption and investigations into the supply of drugs and the associated crime.

“If anyone suspects that drugs are being grown or dealt in their community please call us on 101 to report their suspicions - together we can make our communities safer for everyone.”
