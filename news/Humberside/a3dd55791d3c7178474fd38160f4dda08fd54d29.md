Following a serious incident on Gordon Street, Hull on Monday 22 March, three men have been charged with affray and possession of an offensive weapon.

Following their first appearance at Hull Magistrates Court this morning (Wednesday 24 March), two of the men have been bailed to appear in Hull Crown Court on Wednesday 21 April. The third man has been remanded into custody.

We were called at 8.30pm to reports of a disturbance where a man was said to have been struck by a 4x4 type vehicle and another man had been stabbed. Both sustained injuries which were thankfully not life threatening. The men involved are known to one another and there is no wider risk to members of the public.

Anyone with information in connection with this incident is asked to call us on 101 quoting log number 592 of 22 March. Calls can also be made anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
