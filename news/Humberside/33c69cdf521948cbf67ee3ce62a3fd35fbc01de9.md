A stolen car will soon be back with its rightful owner thanks to a sharp-eyed officer from our Scunthorpe patrol team.

The black BMW was taken from a driveway in Pavilion Gardens in the early hours of Sunday, 27 December.

However, at around 1am today (Wednesday, 13 January) the car was seen in Connaught Road.

A 38-year-old Scunthorpe man has been arrested on suspicion of stealing the car and causing criminal damage to a police vehicle.

He remains in custody at this time, assisting us with our enquiries.
