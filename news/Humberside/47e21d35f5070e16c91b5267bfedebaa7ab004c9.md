It’s been a week now since we announced that we were extending our Operation Galaxy intensified activity and our teams have remained busy.

Since the start of the intensified activity 6 weeks ago we have:

 * Made 696 arrests for various offences including drugs, robbery, burglary, sexual offences and theft
 * Executed 148 warrants at properties across East Yorkshire and Northern Lincolnshire
 * Charged 213 people with crimes, who are currently going through the court process
 * Seized millions of pounds worth of drugs including cocaine, heroin and cannabis
 * Taken numerous weapons off the streets, including a handgun, shotgun, air rifle, two Tasers, an imitation handgun, PAVA spray, knuckle dusters, various bladed weapons including a machete and an axe
 * Detained more than 45 people on fail to appear warrants

Chief Superintendent Darren Downs, leading the operation, said: “Our teams are still out there, progressing investigations, making arrests and bringing charges and taking action against those that are causing the most harm to our communities.

“As well as the warrants, stop searches, arrests and other proactive work going on in the streets, the teams have also been busy progressing our investigations to ensure that we can secure charges and put people before the courts where appropriate.

“This means following up every available line of enquiry which often involves speaking to witnesses, reviewing CCTV, pulling together forensic test results or drug testing and many other aspects to ensure that we have the best possible evidential package possible to put before the courts.

“As well as this ongoing investigative work, the team have carried out three fraud warrants in Hull – recovering 10k worth of targeted property including electrical goods. We have also executed three trading standards warrants at addresses on Washington Street, Farringdon Street and Beech Grove in Hull.”

“If you have any information about crime in your area please call us on our non-emergency 101 line so that we can investigate it. If you would prefer to report information anonymously you can do so via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. In an emergency always dial 999.”
