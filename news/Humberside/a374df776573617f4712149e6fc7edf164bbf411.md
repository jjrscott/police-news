A number of warrants have been executed across Grimsby which has resulted in a huge amount of illegal tobacco and thousands of pounds in cash seized.

Six addresses were searched. At one property on Silver Birch Place officers found over 3,500 packets of cigarettes and more than 800 pouches of rolling tobacco. The haul also included £15,000 in cash

Three vehicles and a number of phones were also seized in Great Coates.

Intelligence was gathered which led officers to a property on Gilbey Road in Grimsby where a cannabis grow was found.

Three men have been arrested and have been released under investigation.

Detective Chief Inspector Christine Calvert said: “This is a very large amount of illegal tobacco that we have seized alongside cash, drugs and other items believed to be involved in crime.

"The tobacco seizure has now been passed over to HMRC who will be investigating this thoroughly.

"Illegal trading of such items can sometimes have links with further criminal activity, so I'm glad that we have found these and disrupted any potential further crimes.

"If you have any information about suspicious activity where you live always contact us and let us know so we can investigate."
