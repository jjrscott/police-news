Three men have been arrested on suspicion of production of cannabis and abstracting electricity today (Wednesday 16 December) following strikes by the Hull Central Neighbourhood Team, with the help of #OpGalaxy, at three properties on Belvoir Street in Hull.

Searching the three properties, which were all next door to one another, they were discovered to have been converted into sophisticated cannabis factories filled with plants of varying stages of growth, with an estimated street value of Â£150,000.

All three men remain in police custody whilst we continue with our investigation.

Your local teams are continuing their action against drugs in your area and continue to encourage anyone with information relating to the production of cannabis, or any drug, to call 101 and report it to us.
