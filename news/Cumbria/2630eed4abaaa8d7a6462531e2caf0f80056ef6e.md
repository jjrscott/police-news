Police are appealing for witnesses following a collision in Carlisle.

Officers were called to the junction of Nelson Street and Denton Street at 6.49pm yesterday after a collision involving a Citroen van and a pedestrian.

The pedestrian, a woman, 70, from the Wigton area, was flown by air ambulance to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle.

Her injuries are not thought to be life threatening at this time. She is in a serious but stable condition.

Officers would ask anybody who witnessed the collision to contact PC 2414 Brockbank on 101, referring to incident 207 of August 9.
