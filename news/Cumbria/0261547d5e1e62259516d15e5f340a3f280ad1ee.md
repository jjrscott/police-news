Police are aware of a video circulating on social media showing a fight apparently taking place in Workington involving two men, watched by a number of other people.

Officers can confirm two men - aged 43 and 27 - and a woman, 26, have been arrested on suspicion of public order offences. They remain in custody today.

Violence will not be tolerated in our communities in west Cumbria. Anyone with any information can contact officers on 101.
