Two people who died following what is believed to be a single-vehicle road traffic collision at the weekend on the A5074 just north of Gilpin Bridge have been identified today (17th March).

Police, fire and ambulance attended the scene of the collision, which is believed to have occurred at some time on Saturday night into the early hours of Sunday morning.

The car involved was a Vauxhall Corsa which had two occupants - David MacIntyre, 43 and Rebecca Macintyre, 37. Both Mr and Mrs MacIntyre lived in Alexandria, Dunbartonshire and died at the scene.

The road was closed for several hours whilst a forensic collision investigation was conducted of the scene.

Police are appealing for witnesses who have any information or may have seen a Vauxhall Corsa on either Saturday night or Sunday morning to contact PC2462 Masters of Cumbria Police on 101 quoting log number 58 of 15th March 2020.
