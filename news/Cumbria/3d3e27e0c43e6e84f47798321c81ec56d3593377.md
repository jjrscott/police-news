Officers are asking motorist to take extra care on the M6 between Junction 36 and Junction 38 following heavy rain fall.

Drivers are asked to drive to the road conditions in front of them, which may be slower than the speed limit.

It means spray and flooding could lead to difficult driving conditions.
