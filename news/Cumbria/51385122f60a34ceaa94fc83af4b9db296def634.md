Joseph Penrith

A man has been jailed for nine years after carrying out a string of sex crimes, with three victims bravely coming forward to reveal he had abused them as children years before.

Joseph Penrith, 44, of Albert Street, Millom, received the lengthy sentence at Preston Crown Court after admitting nine charges, including rape.

Detectives have praised the courage of his victims for coming forward, stressing all victims will be treated sensitively and professionally.

Penrith was also placed on the Sex Offenders' Register for life and was given a Sexual Harm Prevention Order for life. He will also be subject to an extended licence period lasting six years upon his release.

Penrith was arrested in April 2018 on suspicion of online offences.

This prompted three victims to come forward to report non-recent sexual abuse, dating back to when they were children.

Penrith admitted the following charges: inciting a girl under 14 to commit an act of gross indecency, rape, sexual assault, causing a child to watch an image of sexual activity, three counts of indecent assault on a girl under 14, attempting to cause a child to watch an image of sexual activity and attempting to engage in sexual communication with a child.

Speaking after the sentence, Detective Constable Tim Carr said: "We'd like to thank the bravery of Penrith's victims for coming forward.

"This man is now starting a long prison sentence following their accounts.

"I'd like to take this opportunity to stress Cumbria Constabulary takes all reports of abuse seriously.

"We continue to urge anyone who was a victim of abuse to report it - no matter how long ago.

"All victims are treated professionally and sensitively, with dignity and respect."
