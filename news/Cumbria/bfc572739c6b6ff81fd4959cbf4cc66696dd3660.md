Police are renewing an appeal for information following an assault with a weapon that took place on the Brampton Junction road, adjacent to the railway line, between Milton and the B6413 (north of Talkin Tarn) on Friday 30th August between 1:10pm and 1:15pm.

The offender was described as a white man, aged 25-30, around 5ft 9ins, slim, with short stubble fair in colour. This man was described as wearing a dark coloured baseball cap which had a logo on the front, a black waterproof jacket with a blue hoody underneath. He was also wearing blue jeans and white trainers. He spoke with an eastern European accent.

The man is reported to have left the scene in a dark coloured (blue or black) pick-up, similar to a Nissan Navara or Toyota Hi-Lux which was towing an Ifor Williams livestock trailer. The vehicle left in the direction of Farlam/Kirkhouse.

Officers would especially like to speak to the driver of a white Ford Focus travelling towards Brampton from the direction of Milton shortly after the incident as they may have seen the vehicle leaving the scene.

Officers are appealing for anyone who saw this vehicle or has dashcam in the area around the time of the assault which might assist officers, to contact police if they have not already on 101, email 101@cumbria.police.uk, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, quoting log 113 of the 30th August 2019.
