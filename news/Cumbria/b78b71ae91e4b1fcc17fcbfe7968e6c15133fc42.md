Detectives are renewing their appeal for information in relation to an assault which occurred in Carlisle.

At approximately 1.30pm yesterday afternoon (8 June) officers received a report of an altercation on Millholme Avenue. A man, in his early 50s, suffered a laceration to his head which required stitches.

It was reported that a firearm was spotted during the incident, which was later confirmed as an air pistol.

Three men were arrested on suspicion of GBH and have since been bailed. Officers also arrested a man for possession of an imitation firearm, he also has been bailed pending further enquiries.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident in their efforts to ascertain the full circumstances of this incident and how the victim's injury was caused.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 and ask to speak to DC Dawn Grant or quote incident number 98 of 8 June. Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
