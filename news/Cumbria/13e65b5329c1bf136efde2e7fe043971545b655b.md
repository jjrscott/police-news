The A66 Eastbound at Stainmore will be closed at 11am today (Feb 4) while Highways England remove a portacabin that had fallen onto the road while being transported last week (Jan 28)

The road will be reopened when the portacabin has been removed. Delays are expected so please plan your travel accordingly and consider adding extra time to your journey or seek alternative routes where possible.
