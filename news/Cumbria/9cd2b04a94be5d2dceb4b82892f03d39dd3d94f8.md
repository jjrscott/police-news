Officers are asking the public to remain vigilant following reports received this week of elderly residents in the Wigton area receiving fraudulent calls from people attempting to sell WIFI packages.

The offenders are also managing to use people's landline numbers in this area to call other local residents, as people are more likely to answer to a local telephone number.

If you have been affected by this scam, we recommend that you call your phone provider and ask for your telephone number to be changed.

We ask that the public please share this information with any vulnerable friends or family.

If you think you have been the victim of a fraud you can report this to police on 101 and to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 - or by visiting their website at https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/
