Beaconside School - GIST

Cumbria Constabulary officers, including Collision Reduction Officers, joined GIST on Tuesday (19 Nov) who were delivering their Road Safety Programme at Beaconside Primary School in Penrith.

As part of the visit - during Road Safety Week - free high-vis snap bands were handed out to pupils to make them extra-visible to drivers during the dark nights.

Officers as representatives on GIST also gave the pupils education on the importance of being seen when crossing the road and walking home from school.

Sergeant Jack Stabler said: "We'd like to thank GIST and everyone at Beaconside Primary School for what was an extremely worthwhile session.

"As a Constabulary we're always looking for any opportunity to help improve road safety and Tuesday's programme will mean there are pupils in Penrith who are not only more visible now but better informed."
