Naomi Ballantyne

Police have urged people to walk away from trouble in pubs and clubs - after violence in a bar left a man blinded in one eye.

Officers stressed the potentially life-changing consequences of drink-fuelled violence following the sentencing of a couple at court.

Naomi and Darren Ballantyne, of Stainton Gardens, Carlisle, appeared before Carlisle Crown Court following violence in the city during a night out.

Naomi Ballantyne, 32, was jailed for seven years after being found guilty of grievous bodily harm with intent.

Darren Ballantyne, 39, was sentenced to nine months imprisonment, suspended for two years, after admitting affray.

Both ended up in The Cumberland Inn on Botchergate on September 7 last year during a night out.

Trouble broke out involving the couple. This led to Naomi Ballantyne hitting the victim in the face with a glass which smashed.

The glass attack caused numerous lacerations to the victim's eye and ear. It left him permanently blinded in his left eye.

Detective Constable Kerry Gibson, who investigated the case, said: "This incident perfectly demonstrates the potentially life-changing consequences of drink-fuelled violence.

"Cumbria Police and the courts will not tolerate alcohol-related violence.

"If you are going out drinking we ask you to be wary of the effects it might have on you.

"And if you find yourself in a confrontation or trouble, we would urge you to simply walk away and get safely away from any volatile situation."
