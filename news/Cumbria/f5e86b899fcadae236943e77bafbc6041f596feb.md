The family of Ged Doran have released a statement thanking the public and the police.

Many thousands of people shared the appeal for information about Mr Doran's whereabouts on social media and turned out for an organised search that was held yesterday (17th July).

The family said:

"We would like to extend our heartfelt thank you to the people of West Cumbria for your support during this very difficult time. Without you, we may never have found Ged. You have given up your time to search, checked hours of CCTV, and sent messages of condolence to the family. This is the West Cumbria that Ged loved and the place he called home for the last 91 years. Thank you.

His memory will live on in our hearts and our words.

We would also like to thank Cumbria Police and their partners for their professionalism, compassion, and determination over the last week. We could not have asked for a better service.

Funeral arrangements will be announced in the coming days".
