The latest in a series of domestic abuse online surgeries is set to take place tomorrow (6 May).

The social media surgeries, which started last month on the Cumbria Police Facebook page, were hailed a success after nine victims of abuse got in touch during the surgeries and are now being supported by specially trained officers.

The surgeries offer the public an opportunity to speak with practitioners from a number of safeguarding services and ask any questions they may have about domestic abuse.

Tomorrow's surgery, which will take place between 3pm and 5pm, will focus on male domestic abuse victims and what services are available to support them.

Detective Chief Inspector Dan StQuintin said:

"I'd encourage anyone who has any questions on domestic abuse to use these surgeries as an opportunity find out more information from safeguarding professionals.

"So far we have received a number of reports of abuse as a result of our online surgeries. Those who have reported abuse have received appropriate safeguarding support.

"The coronavirus outbreak can make a victim feel particularly isolated and that is why we are holding these sessions to encourage people to report what is happening to them. All victims will be listened to and we will do all we can to protect those suffering from abuse."

Safeguarding agencies represented include Cumbria Police, Victim Support, NSPCC, Cumbria County Council and health agencies.

Questions can be sent in via Facebook Messenger to the Cumbria Police page if you prefer to remain anonymous, or questions can be posted to our event page.
