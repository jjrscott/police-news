Joseph Mjemer

A man who attempted to rape a woman in Carlisle on New Year's Day has been jailed for 11 years.

Joseph Mjemer, 36, of Elizabeth Street, Glasgow, was sentenced today (July 4) at Manchester Crown Court.

Mjemer was found guilty at an earlier trial for attempted rape of a woman in her home.

Detective Constable Deborah Story, North Cumbria Crime and Safeguarding Team, said: "I am pleased that Joseph Mjemer is rightly now in prison for his horrendous crime.

"I would like to praise the bravery of the victim in this case for disclosing what happened to them and for the strength they have shown throughout our investigation.

"I would also like to thank all the witnesses that came forward. Their support has assisted this investigation immensely and has helped put a dangerous offender behind bars.

"I would like to reiterate our commitment to investigating thoroughly any reports of sexual abuse. I would urge anyone who has been subject to offences of this nature to come forward, you will be believed and any report will be dealt with professionally and sensitively."

If you wish to report a crime or speak to an officer about an incident, please contact Cumbria Police on 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
