Terry Abson and Georgina Lands

The family of a woman who has died following a road traffic collision on Monday 1st March on West Tower Street, Carlisle have paid tribute to her life.

Georgina Lands, 56, of Carlisle died in hospital on Monday 8th March.

Her family have released the following statement paying tribute to her life:

"Gina was loving, wilful, and creative. A devoted partner to Terence, known as Terry, and a caring mother to Harley, as well as a wonderful sister and friend to many.

"She was a keen marathon runner in her younger days, before injury limited this ability, but she still remained active walking the dogs, working in the garden and growing her own vegetables. She was a helper at the Buddhist Centre, and loved being a part of the community. She was also an animal lover, previously training cats for shows.

"She was generous and selfless, always giving everything she could to help others.

"Gina is remembered fondly by her adored son Harley as a supportive, encouraging, and imaginative mum. She delighted in creating a world of bedtime stories, the characters of which are still loved to this day, and also organised treasure hunts for fun. She and her partner Terry were both excellent parents and wonderful friends to Harley.

"The family take comfort in the fact that they are now together again, as they were in life."
