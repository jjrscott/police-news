O'Fee was sentenced to eight years for assault with intent to cause GBH following a guilty plea at an earlier hearing.

In the early hours of Friday 14th June 2019, police were called by a member of the public stating a man was lying on the floor on College Street, Whitehaven.

CCTV identified that the assault had initially took place on Lowther Street, Whitehaven before O'Fee walked down Church Street followed by the victim. The assault continued on to College Street before O'Fee left the victim unconscious in the street.

Officers attended the scene and the victim was taken to hospital and had suffered a fracture to the skull, a fracture to the cheek, fracture to the jaw and a broken nose as well as swelling and cuts to his face.

Detective Constable Linzi Wilkinson, said:

"This was a vicious attack on a man that was potentially life threatening.

"The sentence passed today reflects the seriousness of the offences and the level of violence shown.

"Cumbria Police will not tolerate this type of behaviour and look to bring all offenders to justice."
