On Friday (Aug 7) officers conducted an operation in the Wigton area to target rural and wildlife crime, in particular around disrupting poaching offences.

Local PCSO's alongside specially trained wildlife crime officers and officers from the proactive team carried out a stop checkpoint at Fingland Rigg Wood on the B5307.

During the operation officers carried out 89 stop checks on vehicles which lead to the arrest of one man for possession of cannabis and drug driving, he has since been released under investigation. Officers also gave out a number of warnings for perceived speed and defective vehicle lights and one cannabis warning.

Officers also carried out security checks on multiple farms, with no security issues being highlighted. There are small steps that the rural community can take to protect their property, including locking gates and removing keys from vehicles. More security tips can be found here

Sergeant Scott Adams said: "We have received positive feedback from members of the public as part of this operation.

"Cumbria is made of a large rural community and wildlife and rural crime is a priority for the force, operations like this aim to disrupt criminals that are targeting our communities and also build intelligence.

"Rural and wildlife crime offences such as the theft of farm machinery or poaching can have a huge impact on the farming community and we continue to encourage people to contact us and report suspicious activity."
