Detectives investigating the death of 26-year-old Carlisle man Lee McKnight are renewing their appeal for any information that could assist with their investigation.

Officers are particularly interested in any information or footage in the area of Wreay, and the river walk running along the river Petteril from Wreay, in particular any males seen acting suspiciously.

T/Detective Superintendent David Stalker said: "We are seeking information on any movement in the Wreay area and are appealing to anyone who might have seen something in the vicinity of the area on Friday 24th July between 5:30am and 8:30am, to come forward.

"Anyone who might have seen something suspicious, or witnessed people on foot in the area which might have appeared unusual or out of place during your normal routine journey, we urge you to get in touch."

Anyone with any information can report it directly to the Durranhill incident room via the major incident public reporting site here - https://mipp.police.uk/operation/0301020119L92-PO1

Anyone with information can also contact police by calling 101 and ask to speak to an officer from the North Cumbria Crime and Safeguarding Team, quoting incident number 36 of 24 July. Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
