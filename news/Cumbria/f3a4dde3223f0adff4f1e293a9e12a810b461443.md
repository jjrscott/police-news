Police have stepped up patrols in Brampton to offer reassurance following an incident in recent days that led to two arrests.

A man, 44, was assaulted in St Martin's Close on Friday (July 17).

Arrests were swiftly made in connection with the assault. A man, 40, and a male, 17, were arrested and bailed as investigations continue.

Sergeant Adrian Dobson said: "Residents in Brampton may have noticed an increased police presence in the town in recent days.

"This has been both to carry out enquiries and to offer reassurance.

"People in the town may have heard about an assault in recent days and I can confirm two people have been arrested in connection with this. Investigations are continuing.

"We are always keen to be out in the community engaging with the public as much as possible - so anyone who sees our officers out-and-about are always welcome to stop them for a chat if they have any concerns."
