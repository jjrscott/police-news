Bewley

A drug dealer has been jailed for more than five years after admitting possession with intent to supply Class A drugs.

Lee Palmer, 47, of Bousteads Grassing, Carlisle admitted the offence and was sentenced today (14 Oct) at Carlisle Crown Court to five years and seven months.

Also sentenced was his partner, Leanne Bewley, 44, of Grey Street, Carlisle who also admitted possession with intent to supply Class A. She was sentenced to 45 months in prison.

The court heard how, on 7 August 2019, officers stop and searched Bewley under the Misuse of Drugs Act after she left her home address in Aglionby Street in Carlisle.

Four wraps of a brown and white substance were found in her possession - subsequently found to be heroin and crack cocaine.

Officers then searched Bewley's Aglionby Street address and came across Palmer leaving the flat. He was found to be holding a clear bag full of snap bags containing heroin and crack cocaine in one hand and an envelope in the other containing thousands of pounds in cash.

Palmer told the officers: "Nothing I can do now. It's a fair cop."

The flat was then searched and more crack cocaine and heroin was recovered, along with weighing scales and more than Â£3,000 in bank notes. Also found were four mobile phones.

Detective Constable Mike Gilsenan said: "We hope this significant sentence for Palmer sends out a strong message about the consequences of dealing drugs in Cumbria.

"The county is no soft touch when it comes to drug dealing and these defendants are just the latest to be starting periods behind bars after being caught in possession of drugs."
