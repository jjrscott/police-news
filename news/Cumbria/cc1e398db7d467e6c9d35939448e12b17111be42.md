Residents in South Cumbria are asked to be vigilant and take steps to protect their properties following a number of burglaries.

On the 22nd April officers received a report of burglary at a property in that area of Allithwaite which occurred between 2:30pm and 4pm. A laptop and a book were taken and it is believed unknown persons entered through an insecure door.

Officers received reports of a burglary at a property in Cark on the 23rd April after a purse was taken, it is believed unknown persons have entered the property via an insecure door.

Home owners are reminded to lock doors and windows to their property when in their gardens or when inside the property and keep valuables out of sight.

Inspector Sara Seath Said:

"Although we are currently in lockdown and people should only be leaving their homes for essential reasons unfortunately, there are those that will continue to commit crime.

"Thieves will look for easy targets and if they can gain access to your home without having to force entry then they will steal from you.

"It's important that people take basic steps such as locking windows and doors - even when they are at home - to help prevent criminals from committing offences."

If you see any suspicious activity, please contact police on 101. If you witness a crime in action please dial 999.
