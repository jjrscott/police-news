The A595 Distington bypass has reopened following a collision this morning (July 3).

The collision, involving a motorcycle and a car, happened just after 6am.

The motorcyclist, a man, 30, of Whitehaven, was taken to the Cumberland Infirmary in Carlisle.

His injuries were serious but are not thought to be life threatening at this time.

The driver of the Volkswagen Polo involved, a woman, sustained minor injuries and was checked at the West Cumberland Hospital in Whitehaven.

Motorists are thanked for their patience while the road was closed.

Anyone who witnessed the collision or the vehicles before - or has any information - should contact 101, referring to incident 31 of July 3.
