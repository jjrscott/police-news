Police are appealing for information in relation to a robbery that occurred this afternoon (30 May) in Workington.

At approximately 3.35pm, a man and a woman stole a small amount of cash and medication from a house on Firth View Walk after threatening a man who lived at the address. The two suspects gained access to the house after claiming they were from a housing association and were checking on elderly residents.

Descriptions of the suspects are as follows:

* Suspect 1: Male, aged in mid 30s, 5ft 8 with a shaven head. He was reported to be wearing an old-style Liverpool FC shirt and jeans.

* Suspect 2: Female, aged in her 20s, 5ft 4 with short blonde hair. She was reported to be wearing a white t-shirt, blue shorts and pink trainers.

The victim, a man in his 60s, suffered minor injuries.

Officers are appealing for anyone who has seen anyone matching the descriptions of either suspect to contact police.

Detective Sergeant Bethany Casson said:

"We would like the public's help in tracing the two people responsible. They subjected the victim to a terrifying ordeal which would leave any person shaken. Fortunately the injuries were not serious, however that does not dilute the seriousness of this incident.

"Our officers have been conducting house-to-house enquiries and we urge people in Workington to be vigilant of two people matching the descriptions we have provided and who claim to work for a housing association.

"I'd urge anyone with information in relation to this incident or who noticed any suspicious activity in the area of Firth View Walk this afternoon to get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting incident number 171 of May 30. Alternatively information can be disclosed anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
