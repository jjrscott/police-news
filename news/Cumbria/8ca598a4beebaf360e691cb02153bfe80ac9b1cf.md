Officers investigating a report of a serious sexual assault in Appleby are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

The incident was reported to police shortly after 8.30pm yesterday (30 May) and officers swiftly arrested two teenagers on suspicion of rape of a girl under the age of 16 and sexual assault.

The two males - aged 14 and 15 and from outside the county - are currently in police custody.

Temporary Chief Superintendent Rob O'Connor of Cumbria Police said: "This is clearly a serious incident and I can assure the public it will be investigated thoroughly and effectively.

"Officers were able to make arrests very quickly following the report, and the two males arrested remain in police custody.

"This is an active, on-going investigation and I would therefore urge the public not to speculate online.

"I would also urge anyone with information about this incident who has yet to come forward to do so immediately."

Anyone with information should contact police referencing incident 220 of 30 May 2019.
