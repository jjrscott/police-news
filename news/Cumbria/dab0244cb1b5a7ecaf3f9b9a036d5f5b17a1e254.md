Jon-jay Thompson

A Maryport man has been jailed for 2 years 10 months at Carlisle Crown Court today (July 14) for an assault that left his victim with significant injuries.

Jon-jay Thompson, 24, of Victoria Terrace, Maryport has been sentenced to 2 years 10 months for Section 20 assault - GBH.

Officers were called by the North West Ambulance Service on the 18th February having been contacted by Thompson for his own minor injuries. However ambulance staff had concerns for his partner at the time who had significant injuries needing hospital treatment. It was believed by Ambulance staff the injuries were caused by Thompson.

Thompson and the victim had argued before Thompson pinned her to the bed while punching and attempting to strangle her. He also claimed while carrying out the assault he was going to kill the victim.

His now ex-partner suffered multiple fractured ribs, a collapsed lung and bruising to the lung which required a chest drain. She also suffered bite marks to the nose, arm and finger.

**_Detective Sarah Lee said:_**

"This is a great result, Thompson is a dangerous and violent offender who subjected his partner to a horrific attack.
