Longtown Community Alcohol Partnership has been nominated for a national award in recognition of work to tackle underage drinking.

Longtown CAP has made the shortlist for the national Community Alcohol Partnerships award at the 2020 Community Alcohol Partnership Awards.

The Longtown partnership made the cut if recognition of efforts which have reduced antisocial behaviour, criminality and under-age drinking in the area.

Sergeant Scott Adams said: "We have seen a marked reduction in antisocial behaviour and reports of criminal offences.

"We've worked with schools, with licensed premises and with the young people themselves and the result has been extremely positive.

"We've been able to successfully identify those young people at risk of causing antisocial behaviour and engage with them."

A total of 18 young people have been engaged with youth activities at the community centre - a provision which previously did not exist, which has helped significantly reduce the number of young people who have been drinking under-age.

Problem premises for selling to underage children have also been engaged with and have since passed test purchasing operations conducted with Trading Standards.

The awards are being held at the House of Commons on the 28th January 2020.
