A man from Kendal has today (Feb 21) been sentenced for possession with intent to supply of a Class B cannabis.

Officers attended a garage on Wasdale Close, Kendal on the 22nd January 2020 and arrested Lightley. Following a search of the garage a bumbag was found underneath the bed Lightley was sleeping which contained 15 snap bags of cannabis and a rock of grey substance identified as MDMA.

The recovered drugs were valued at Â£300.

"This is a great results and I hope this acts as a deterrent to others and sends out a strong message about the consequences of dealing drugs in Cumbria.

"Drug supply has a negative effect on the community and we will continue to target both individuals and groups who believe they can supply drugs in the local area."

Anyone with information on drug supply can contact Cumbria Police on 101 or anonymously, via Crimestoppers, on 0800 555 111.
