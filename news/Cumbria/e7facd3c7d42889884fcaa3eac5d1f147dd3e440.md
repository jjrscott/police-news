Police were called at 10.13am on the 27 August following a collision involving a cyclist and a grey Nissan Almera car on Main Street at the junction with Front Street, Brampton.

As a result of the collision, the cyclist Greg Cameron, aged 51 from Brampton, has sadly died due to the injuries sustained. Our thoughts are with the family at this time.

His family are being supported by a family liaison officer.

Officers are still keen to speak to a woman pedestrian who witnessed the incident but left in the direction of Front Street before leaving her details.

Anyone with any information or who witnessed the collision is asked to contact PC 2670 Woodcock or Sgt 1962 Vickers on 101 - or email the serious collision unit SCIU@cumbria.police.uk, quoting incident number 55 of 27 August.
