Detectives investigating the death of 26-year-old Carlisle man Lee McKnight are continuing their request for the public's help on the movements of a blue Citroen C3 registration - FY05 TFZ.

Officers are particularly interested in the movements of the vehicle in the Carlisle city centre and the south and east areas of the city including Upperby, Currock and areas between Warwick Road and Botchergate.

Officers are also extending their interest to routes around rural areas heading out of the city towards and in or around the areas of Durdar, Golden Fleece, Southwaite and Wreay and the A6 from Low Heskett into Carlisle.

T/Detective Superintendent David Stalker said: "We are seeking information to establish the movements of the blue Citroen and are appealing to anyone who was driving in the vicinity of the following locations between 4:30am and 7am on Friday 24th July that could have dash cam footage of the vehicle, to come forward.

"Anyone who might have seen something suspicious, or witnessed people on foot in the area which might have appeared unusual or out of place during your normal routine journey, we urge you to get in touch."

Anyone with any information can report it directly to the Durranhill incident room via the major incident public reporting site here - https://mipp.police.uk/

Anyone with information can also contact police by calling 101 and ask to speak to an officer from the North Cumbria Crime and Safeguarding Team, quoting incident number 36 of 24 July. Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
