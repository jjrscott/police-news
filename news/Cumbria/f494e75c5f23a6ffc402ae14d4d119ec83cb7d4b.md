Four people in Cumbria have been reported this weekend for disregarding the new government measures.

A 24-year-old man from Whitehaven has been the first person in West Cumbria to be reported for being in a public area without lawful reason.

The man had repeatedly been seen out in Whitehaven town centre over the weekend with no reason and officers explained the situation to him numerous times which he ignored.

He was spotted again this morning and was returned home by officers who then reported him for the offence.

In a separate incident in Carlisle, three people were reported last night for having a house party with friends, again going against the Covid-19 restrictions that are in place.

Temporary Chief Superintendent Rob O'Connor said: "Cumbria Police are making every effort to engage with the public in these unprecedented times.

"This weekend we have seen the residents of Cumbria and tourists complying with the restrictions, with the Lake District and town centres being extremely quiet"

"Police will continue to speak to members of the public and provide information around the government legislation, seeking to gain compliance through communication and collaboration with our communities.

"Officers are aware that the overwhelming majority of our communities are abiding by the rules in order to help us all protect the NHS and the most vulnerable people in society. Our plea to the public is to continue to listen to the guidance given to you and we will get through this together".
