Barrow police are holding another crime prevention desk following the success of one held in June. The mobile police desk was originally trialled following high levels of residential burglaries in the area, a high percentage of these were due to insecure doors and windows (or outbuildings).

The desk will be held on Wednesday the 13th November from 12pm to 6pm the desk and will visit multiple residential streets in the Newbarns and Risedale area of Barrow and will be run out of the Joint Emergency Service Vehicle.

The desk is designed to give advice to residents and provide personalised home security information, the desk is running again in the run up to winter which in turn brings darker nights. The event aims to increase resident's sense of security and reduce the opportunity for these offences to occur.

On board the vehicle will be a Local PCSO, Crime Prevention Officer and the local Neighbourhood Watch Coordinator. The vehicle turns into a mobile desk where residents can come and sit and discuss any concerns they have and obtain crime prevention information they can take home. Residents are encouraged to visit the street nearest to them.

Time table as follows:

12:00 - Fife street

12:45 - Kent street

13:30 - Derby street

14:15 - Break

15:00 - Risedale Road

15:45 - Abbotsvale

16:30 - Hempland Avenue

17:15 - West Avenue

"We held a similar desk five months ago which was a great success and was a great way to get out into the community and provide the public with crime prevention advice.

"We hope that by visiting people's streets, resident will want to come and have a chat with us, ask advice, or, if it would help, we could arrange a visit to their home and offer some specific tips for keeping their home and property safe.

"We will be visiting lots of streets in the area over the period, and I would encouraging everyone in any neighbouring roads to pop round to the mobile police desk nearest to them. You can find a list of the mobile police desk locations and times here:

"Previously, we have provided crime prevention advice to residents through a door to door drops and social media posts, but as these crimes are still occurring we are trailing a mobile police desk to see if that works better for residents."

**Sergeant Andrew Travis said:**

"I hope local residents will take the chance to get involved and learn some valuable tips to best help keep their property safe. This is a really proactive approach to help solve the problem of opportunist burglaries and thefts by educating the local community on steps they can take to prevent being victims of crime.

"This not only help us to push crime prevention messages but give the local community the opportunity to meet there local policing team and raise any concerns."
