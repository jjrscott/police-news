Nicky Hewitson

Police in west Cumbria have warned they will not tolerate burglars targeting people's homes - after two men who broke into a house while the occupants slept were jailed for a total of more than five years.

Nicky Hewitson, 32, and Lee Moore, 43, were handed the sentences at Carlisle Crown Court today (January 24).
Hewitson, who admitted burglary, was jailed for two years and four months. Moore, who was found guilty after a trial, was imprisoned for three years.

The burglary happened at a home in Flimby in the early hours of September 24.

The people living there were woken following noises. Looking out of the window, one spotted a man leaving the house.

Bank cards and other cards had been stolen.

Police searches and inquiries led to Hewitson and Moore, both of no fixed abode. Found near them were the stolen bank cards.

Detective Constable James Graham said: "These men targeted this house while the people inside were asleep.

"The people of west Cumbria can be assured we will not tolerate any burglaries targeting any kind of properties.

"Those who do so can expect to face a police investigation and prosecution.

"These men thought they could enter where they shouldn't be and take what didn't belong to them.

"They now both have time to reflect on this."
