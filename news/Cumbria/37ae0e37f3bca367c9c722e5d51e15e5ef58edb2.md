A bike seized by police during the Week of Action

Police in west Cumbria carried out 15 raids, seized thousands of pounds in cash and arrested a dozen people as they addressed the issues mattering most to people during a Week of Action.

Suspected drugs criminals, those carrying out rural crime and drivers posing problems for others were among those targeted as officers acted on community concerns and sent a warning out to criminals.

This Week of Action emphasised what Cumbria Constabulary does all-year-round - deterring and tackling crime and keeping people safe.

Officers shone the spotlight on their work as they carried out visible drugs warrants, conducted deterrent operations and offered crime-busting advice to people.

Inspector Richard Smillie oversaw the west Cumbria phase. The Week of Action was held countywide.

He said: "Our officers work round-the-clock for the community taking part in this type of action all-year-round.

"What this Week of Action has done is highlighted this work and sent out a clear warning message to criminals: We are no soft touch.

"After this week we will continue to work with our partners to look at associated issues. For instance, where drug crimes are identified we will work with housing partners to look at any relevant tenancies.

"If criminals out there are in any doubt we take these issues seriously then this should serve notice that we will not stand for this type of activity in our communities."

Superintendent Carl Patrick said: "Officers and staff have worked tirelessly over the last week to carry out this action.

"As the activities show, they have been listening to community concerns, acting on intelligence and targeting the issues people care about.

"Criminals should take note of what has been done and they can rest assured more is to come."

**Over the week of action in west Cumbria:**

** **

Temporary Chief Superintendent Rob O'Connor said: "Our officers work 365-days-a-year to help keep people safe and this past week we opened our doors to shine a light on unseen policing which the majority of people are unaware of.

"From dawn drug raids to distracted drivers, our officers have been busy across the county this past week, tackling issues that local communities have told us are important to them.

"But I can assure people this is not a one-off. This type of activity is going on every day - and will continue to do so.

"I can promise the public our officers will continue to work diligently - often alongside colleagues from partner agencies, both in the emergency services and beyond - to tackle community issues, arrest criminals and keep Cumbria one of the safest places in the country to live, work and visit."

Cumbria's Police and Crime Commissioner Peter McCall said: "The police are dealing with all types of crime, including those highlighted in this Week of Action, every day.

"The point of a week of action is to focus on those issues which the public tell us concern them locally and to send a strong message to people who break the law that the police can and do respond and you will be caught.

"The Week of Action is also a good opportunity to recognise the excellent work our police do every week to keep Cumbria as one of the safest counties in the country."
