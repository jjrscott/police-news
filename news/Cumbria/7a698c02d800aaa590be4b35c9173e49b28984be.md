Ronnie Monks

The family of 72-year-old Ronnie Monks, who sadly died in a road traffic collision on the 11th July, paid tribute to him today by saying:

"Ronnie was a loving, caring man who sadly leaves behind his wife, children and grandchildren.

"Bolton born and living in Manchester, he was a diverse character with a thirst for knowledge. He loved to learn and he had many interests, from strange foreign rock music, to travelling around France in his camper van with his loving wife Viv. He was also an avid supporter of Manchester United football club and enjoyed watching them play.

"Ronnie was the founding member of a local motorcycle club and was extremely proud to have been involved with setting this up. He was ex REME in the Army and this is where he discovered motorbikes; which alongside music, proved to be a lifelong passion.

"He enjoyed every moment he could during his life and he made the most of every opportunity. His tragic and sudden loss will be felt across the local area for a long, long time and he will sadly missed by everyone who knew him."

Cumbria Police are still appealing for any witnesses to the collision which happened on Townhead Lane, Ravenstonedale, near to the junction for the A683. If anyone has any information, please email SCIU@cumbria.police.uk or call 101 and contact PC 353 Thompson of North MSG quoting log number 155 of the 11th July.
