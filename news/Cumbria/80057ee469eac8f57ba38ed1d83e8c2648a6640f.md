Police can confirm the sudden death of a man in Aberdeen Street, Barrow, is not being treated as suspicious.

Officers attended an address on Tuesday (Feb 4) following the sudden death of a man in his forties inside the address.

An investigation was launched but this has since established the death is not suspicious.

Detective Inspector Fae Dilks said:

"We would like to reassure people a thorough investigation has been carried out, and whilst the death is unexplained at this time, it is not being treated as suspicious.

"The man has been identified and his family have been informed.

"A file will now be prepared for the coroner."
