An investigation is underway into an aggravated burglary at a house in Carlisle.

Police were contacted shortly after 8pm yesterday (October 1) with a report of burglary, where a woman had been threatened and assaulted inside a house on Orchard Street. It is believed three men accessed the house and demanded money from the occupant.

A cordon is in place at the scene as officers carry out their inquiries.

The victim, a woman in her 30s, suffered a minor hand injury during the incident.

The full circumstances of the incident are being ascertained but police cannot rule out, at this stage, that a knife was involved. Such incidents are rare in Cumbria and detectives request the public's assistance in this investigation.

In particular, officers want to hear from nearby residents who may have noticed any suspicious activity in the area yesterday evening.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting incident number 219 of October 1. Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
