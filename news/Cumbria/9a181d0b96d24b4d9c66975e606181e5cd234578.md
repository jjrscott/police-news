Road closures are in place on the A66 near Cockermouth following the report of a suspected gas leak just after 11.20am today (Oct 12).

Motorists are asked to avoid the area, with closures in place at the Fitz and Oakhurst roundabouts and at Brigham.

Those living nearby are being advised to keep their doors and windows closed as a precaution - although the suspected leak is some way away from any homes.

Engineers have been called out. The suspected leak is between the Fitz and Oakhurst roundabouts.
