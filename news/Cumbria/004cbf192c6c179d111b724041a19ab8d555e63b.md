Wanted: David Lukac

Officers are requesting the public's help in locating a 27-year-old man wanted for failing to appear at court for sentencing.

David Lukac was jailed, in his absence, for two and half years for an offence of fraud by false representation.

Originally from Slovakia, Lukac also has links across Yorkshire and the West Midlands.

He has tattoos on his left arm and neck. An appeal for information on his whereabouts was broadcast on the BBC's Crimewatch Roadshow today (September 20).

Anyone with information is asked to contact Cumbria Police on 101.

Alternatively, if you prefer to remain 100% anonymous, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
