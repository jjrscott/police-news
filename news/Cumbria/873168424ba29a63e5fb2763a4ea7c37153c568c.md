Stephen Hodgson

A man who attempted to rape a girl in her late teens has been jailed for eight years.

Stephen Hodgson, aged 23 of no fixed abode was sentenced today (May 19) at Carlisle Crown Court for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and attempt to rape a woman - over 16.

Hodgson was found guilty at an earlier hearing for the offences, which occurred at a property in Kendal.

**_Detective Sergeant Duncan Helmn said,_**

"This was a horrendous attack on a young vulnerable girl.

"The defendant had travelled from West Cumbria to Kendal having been introduced to the victim online.

"His intentions were clear from the start, this was evident from the horrific internet searches we found on his phone.

"He was only prevented from carrying out the full attack by the key witness in the case, who I want to thank for bravely stepping in.

"I also want to thank the victim for the bravery and courage she has shown throughout this ordeal, as well as all the officers involved in ensuring this man faces a lengthy term of imprisonment.

 "I would urge anyone who has been subject to offences of this nature to come forward, you will be believed and any report will be dealt with professionally and sensitively."
