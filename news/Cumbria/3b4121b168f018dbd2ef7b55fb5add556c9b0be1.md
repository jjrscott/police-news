Police are appealing for witnesses following an incident in the Currock area of Carlisle on Sunday evening.

Officers received a report of a sexual assault of a girl, in her late teens. She also sustained minor facial injuries.

Two men, in their twenties, have been arrested on suspicion of rape. They were later released on bail as investigations continue.

Officers believe a blue Ford vehicle may be relevant to the investigation and are keen to speak to anyone who saw a female with two men.

Police are also appealing for anyone who witnessed a disturbance or saw this type of vehicle between 6pm and 10pm on Sunday in the Botchergate, St Nicholas Bridge, Blackwell Road or Currock areas of Carlisle.

We are also interested in any private CCTV, dashcam or doorbell camera footage that people may have which covers these locations.

Anyone with information should contact DC 2667 Fearn on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, referring to incident 201 of November 8.
