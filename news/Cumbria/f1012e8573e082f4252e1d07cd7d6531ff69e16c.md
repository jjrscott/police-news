Five vehicles were targeted overnight from Monday (February 10) until Tuesday (February 11), on Raefield and Moor Road, with property stolen from inside.

Thefts on Raefield included from a car in which items including glasses were taken and from a Citroen C4 in which items including CDs and clothes were stolen.

"We also want to make vehicle owners aware so they can take the necessary precautions to protect themselves.

"Please make sure your vehicles are locked and secured when you leave them.

"We would also ask people not to leave anything valuable inside."
