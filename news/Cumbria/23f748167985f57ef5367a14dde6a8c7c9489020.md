A premises licence holder has been fined after a Carlisle store sold alcohol to a schoolboy on two separate occasions.

The fine follows a test purchase operation conducted by officers from the Carlisle Local Focus team and Trading Standards at the One Stop store, Fusehill Street.

A 15-year-old boy, accompanied by a girl of the same age, was sold four cans of cider in April 2018. No identification was requested despite the store promoting a 'Challenge 25' policy. The same schoolboy, by then 16, returned under two months later and was sold lager.

David Forrester, the licence holder, was summoned to attend North & West Cumbria Magistrates' Court earlier this week (July 17) but failed to appear. In his absence a charge of selling alcohol to an under-18 person was proven.

PC Mike Watson, Carlisle Local Focus Team, said:

"We work in partnership with licence holders and Trading Standards to prevent the sale of alcohol to those underage. We do this to prevent any related antisocial behaviour and also to protect the health of young people.

"Licence holders are well aware of the consequences of selling alcohol to children and we work with them to educate their staff on the importance of requesting identification.

"I hope that this cases sends a clear message to all licence holders and that they do any work necessary to remind their staff of the importance to challenge."

Forrester, of Longlands Road, Stanwix, Carlisle, was fined £770, and ordered to pay a £77 victim surcharge and £2,335.32 costs.
