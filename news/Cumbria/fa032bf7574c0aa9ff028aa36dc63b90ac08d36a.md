Scott Topping

A Wigton man who told police he stabbed a man because he was "good at it" has been jailed for attempted murder.

Scott Thomas Topping, aged 39, was sentenced today (25th October) at Carlisle Crown Court to 20 years in prison, with a minimum of 10 years.

Topping, of Mulligan's Court, was found guilty by a jury at a hearing earlier this month in connection with an incident that occurred in King Street on 12 April.

Topping stabbed the victim with a knife to the victim's face outside the Throstle's Nest pub. The victim required emergency surgery and was put into an induced coma as result of Topping's violent attack.

Detective Inspector Matt Scott said:

"This was an incredibly violent incident for which the victim was extremely lucky to survive.

"When Topping stabbed the victim, the knife was millimetres from colliding with a carotid artery which would have placed the victim's life very much at risk.

"Topping deserves the sentence he received. This sends out a clear message to those who engage in violent behaviour that they can expect for this to result in time in prison.

"In Cumbria, we are pleased to live and work in area that does not have a culture of knife crime. We are not complacent and we will continue to protect people across the county through conducting engagement work and robust investigations, as evidenced in this case."
