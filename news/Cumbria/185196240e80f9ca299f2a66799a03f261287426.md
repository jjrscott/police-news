Kenneth Pointon

A man has been jailed after carrying out a brutal domestic assault.

Police have stressed again they will take all reports of domestic abuse seriously as Kenneth Pointon, 30, was sentenced to 20 months in custody.

Pointon, of Stockwell Road, Carlisle, assaulted his partner on October 17 after he had been drinking.

She suffered a black eye, swollen cheekbone and bruising to her arms as she tried to fend off the blows.

Pointon admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm and was sentenced at Carlisle Crown Court today. The judge also imposed a seven year restraining order preventing him from contacting the victim and going to her home.

Detective Constable Michael Gilsenan, who oversaw the case, spoke after the sentencing.

He said: "This was a brutal attack and Pointon now has time to reflect on his actions.

"Domestic violence is always a priority for Cumbria Constabulary and we take a proactive and sensitive approach to investigating incidents which are reported to us.

"Anyone experiencing domestic abuse can feel reassured that all reports will be dealt with sensitively and professionally.

"Our officers are committed to tackling all types of domestic abuse, prosecuting those responsible and working with partner agencies to support victims and survivors."

The constabulary is running a domestic abuse awareness campaign this month.

It features the daily promotion of different support services on the force's social media accounts.

If you have been the victim of domestic abuse, or are concerned for someone who is, you can report this by calling 101. Always dial 999 in an emergency.
You can access support services regardless of whether you have reported a crime to the police. To access support services independently, contact Victim Support 24/7 on 0808 1689 111 - or visit the Cumbria Together website www.cumbriatogether.com.
