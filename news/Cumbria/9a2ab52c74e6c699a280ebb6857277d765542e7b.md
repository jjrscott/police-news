The M6 has been closed on both carriageways between junctions 40 and 41 following a collision this morning.
Police were called at 7.50am following a report of a collision on the northbound side involving two vehicles.
It is unclear at this time how long the closure might last. Motorists should take this into account when planning journeys.
