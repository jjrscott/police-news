Wanted: Waqas Younus

Officers are requesting the public's help in locating a 32-year-old man wanted in connection with the false imprisonment of a woman.

Waqas Younus is wanted in connection with an incident which occurred between August and September 2013. He was released on bail, but failed to return for further questioning.

Younus, who is originally from Pakistan, has links to Chorley, Manchester and London. It is believed that he may be working as a shop assistant.

An appeal for information on his whereabouts was broadcast on the BBC's Crimewatch Roadshow today (March 12).

Anyone with information is asked to contact Cumbria Police on 101.

Alternatively, if you prefer to remain 100 per cent anonymous, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
