A man who was found guilty of two counts of child abduction has today been jailed for 16 weeks.

Joby Cherian, 43, of Woodhouse Road, Sheffield had denied the charges but was found guilty and sentenced today (11 March) at Barrow Magistrates' Court.

The court heard how, on 2 March 2019, Cherian contacted two 16-year old girls - one of whom was in local authority care in Cumbria, and another who was in care outside the Cumbria area - via social media. Both then went missing from their respective homes, and Cherian travelled to Cumbria to meet one of the girls before travelling to Humberside where they met up with the second teenager.

Cherian was arrested on 4 March 2019 on suspicion of kidnap and later charged with two counts of child abduction.

Detective Inspector Fae Dilks said: "This was a complex investigation, made particularly challenging for officers due to the vulnerability of the victims.

"However, the prosecution and conviction of Cherian has resulted in the children involved being safeguarded, and will also prevent Cherian from being employed again as a nurse. The partner agencies involved in this investigation continue to work together to ensure that vulnerable children are safeguarded from predatory offenders such as Cherian.

"I would like to thank the officers who worked so diligently and professionally on this protracted and complex investigation."
