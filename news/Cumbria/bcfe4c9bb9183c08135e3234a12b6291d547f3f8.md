Officers investigating a fatal collision that occurred at around 2:30pm on the 21st June on Abbey Road, Dalton are appealing for witnesses who may have been at the scene of the collision or who may have driven in the Mill Brow or Squirrel Bank area of Dalton.

Sergeant Jack Stabler said:

"We are also looking to identify any witnesses or anyone with dashcam that was travelling on Abbey Road, Barrow between the time of 2pm and 2:30pm on the 21st June, that might have footage or evidence of a silver Peugeot registration number KM05 HHT in the area.

"Anyone who was at the scene at the time of the incident or shorty after is asked to also contact us. Any information however small could help our investigation."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Sgt Stabler or PC Fowkes on 101 or email the serious collision investigation unit on SCIU@cumbria.police.uk referencing incident number of the 124 of the 21st June 2020.
