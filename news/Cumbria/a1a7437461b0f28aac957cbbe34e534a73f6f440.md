The A6 has been closed in Cumbria between Shap and Kendal due to heavy snow at Shap summit.

The closure is in effect from the M6 junction 39 slip road south of Shap and and just north of Kendal at the Burneside junction.

County Council highways teams are in attendance and attempting to clear the route to assist ongoing efforts by United Utilities staff to fix the water issue affecting part of Cumbria.

Diversions are in place via the M6 motorway.
