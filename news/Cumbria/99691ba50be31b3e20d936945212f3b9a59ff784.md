Police are appealing for witnesses following a collision on the A65 at Kirkby Lonsdale on Wednesday June 24.

At 12.45pm, a two vehicle collision happened at the junction of Bridge Brow, near Devil's Bridge.

The collision involved a red Seat Mii and a red Volkswagen Golf Tdi.

Minor injuries were reported to several occupants of both vehicles at the time with one of these, Norah Sparrow, 81, from Casterton, taken by ambulance for treatment at Royal Preston Hospital.

Sadly, Norah Sparrow died on July 12 while in hospital.

A family liaison officer is currently working with Norah's family at this time.

If you were in the area at the time and may have seen the collision - or if you have dashcam footage that may contain either vehicle - please contact Cumbria Police on 101 or email SCIU@cumbria.police.uk, quoting log number 92 of June 24.
