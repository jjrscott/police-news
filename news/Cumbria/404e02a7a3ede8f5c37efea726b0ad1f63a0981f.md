The Appleby Pubwatch scheme has been hailed a success at a recent meeting of its members.

The scheme, which currently has over 20 licensed premises involved, has seen a decrease in anti-social behaviour with only a handful of warning letters sent out to pub goers and no cases where an individual has received a ban since the scheme started in April 2019.

The scheme has options from sending warning letters to banning individuals depending on the severity of their behaviour, which can be put in place for anything from a few months to several years. Once banned this means that the individual cannot enter licensed premises in Appleby, Penrith, Carlisle and Alston.

PCSO Sally Ewbank said: "Pubwatch is an excellent community safety initiative because not only does it make licensed premises safer and more enjoyable, it helps improve the quality of life for the community in general as the scheme has made people think twice about committing anti-social behaviour offences due to the consequences."
