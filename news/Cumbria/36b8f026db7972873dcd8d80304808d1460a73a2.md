The M6 southbound carriageway has reopened following a collision between junctions 40 and 41 this morning. The northbound remains closed.
It is unclear at this time how long this might last. Motorists should take this into account when planning journeys.
Police were called at 7.50am following a report of a collision on the northbound side involving two vehicles.
