Ashton Waugh

A Brampton woman has been issued with a two-year Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) following 23 offences of shoplifting.

Ashton Waugh, 23 of St Martins Drive, Brampton, was issued the order yesterday (July 30) at North and West Cumbria Magistrates' Court.

Waugh had been found guilty of 23 offences of shoplifting in Carlisle and Brampton at an earlier hearing.

The order that will last for two years has conditions:

* Not to go into specified shops in Brampton

* Not to enter any premises part of the Carlisle shopwatch / retailers against crime scheme

* Not to go into retail premises in Carlisle city centre.

PC Sam Butler, Carlisle Local Focus Team, said:

"This CBO was a great outcome as Waugh is a prolific shoplifter and I hope that the conditions will allow her to reflect on and change her behaviour.

"CBOs are a useful tool available to the courts which can help the offender to cease further criminality and help protect residents.

"In this instance, the court agreed with our application for the order regarding a persistent offender who we continually have to deal with which takes away resources to those that genuinely require the help of officers.

"I would encourage anyone who witnesses the terms of such a court order being broken to contact the police immediately. The punishment for breaking the terms of a CBO can be up to five years in prison."
