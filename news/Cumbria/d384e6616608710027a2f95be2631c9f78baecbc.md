James Wilson

A man who stabbed a man in a Carlisle street has been jailed for 63 months.

James Wilson, aged 40, was sentenced at Carlisle Crown Court yesterday (June 17).

Wilson, of Prescott Street, Carlisle, was jailed for an incident that occurred in February this year. The victim, a 29-year-old Carlisle man, was stabbed outside an address on Ashness Drive.

The stabbing resulted in hospital treatment for a deep laceration to the side of the head and forehead along with a wound to the rear of the shoulder and abdomen.

Wilson pleaded guilty to Section 18 wounding with intent.

Detective Constable Stephen Kidd, North Crime & Safeguarding Team, said:

"We are pleased that James Wilson has been jailed for his senseless violence.

"Although he and the victim in this case were known to each other, it does not dilute the seriousness of this incident.

"Fortunately the victim was able to get hospital treatment which meant his injuries were not as serious as first feared.

"The use of knives can lead to fatal consequences and we will not tolerate this happening in our communities.

"I hope that the prison sentence can send a clear message to those who would consider using a knife, that if you do we will do all we can to ensure you are removed from society and spend time in prison."
