Malcolm Israel

A man who sexually assaulted two girls has been jailed for five years.

Malcolm Shaun Israel, 59, was also placed on the Sex Offenders' Register for life during his sentencing at Carlisle Crown Court today (November 13).

Israel, of Haig Road, Carlisle, admitted two counts of sexual assault on one child and two charges of sexual assault by touching on the other child.

The assaults happened in August.

Detective Constable Matthew Rees investigated the case.

Speaking after the hearing, he said: "I'd encourage anyone who believes they may be a victim of sexual abuse or child sexual exploitation to report it at the earliest opportunity.

"We will thoroughly investigate any information we receive to bring offenders to justice.

"Every single report is treated professionally and sensitively and victims will be supported by specially trained officers."

Anyone with information can contact police on 101.
