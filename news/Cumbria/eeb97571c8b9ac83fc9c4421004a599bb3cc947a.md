Lee Mercer

Police were called at 6:45pm on Sunday 25th August 2019 to the report of a two vehicle road traffic collision on the A595 at Muncaster.

It involved a blue Kawasaki motorcycle and a black Seat Ibiza.

As a result of the collision, the rider of the motorcycle, Lee Mercer, 46, from Blackburn, sadly died at the scene.

Lee's family said:

"Lee was a much loved son to Brian and Lorraine, a loving and caring father to Brandon and Zac, brother to Carl, Nina and Aimie, and partner to Andrea.

"He was loved by all who knew him, known for always enjoying a chat and his willingness to help others at the drop of the hat. This chatty and altruistic nature saw him always putting a smile on his grandma's face every time he visited, or helping to care for his grandfather in his final years, and his caring nature naturally extended to his profession.

"He was keen fan of the latest music and films, and would often attend concerts. He loved to visit family and friends and never had a problem keeping the conversation flowing. Lee brought warmth into the lives of many and will be in our hearts forever."

The occupants of the car were uninjured.

The road was closed for six hours whilst a forensic collision investigation and recovery was carried out.

Anyone with any information or who witnessed the collision is asked to contact PC2422 Motum or Sgt 1929 Bainbridge on 101 or email 101@cumbria.police.uk, quoting log 195 of the 25th August 2019.
