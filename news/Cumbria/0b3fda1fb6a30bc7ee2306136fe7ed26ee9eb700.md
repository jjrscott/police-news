Wanted: Darius Jankauskas

Officers are requesting the public's help in locating a 33-year-old man wanted in connection with the discovery of more than 300 cannabis plants at an industrial unit in Carlisle.

Darius Jankauskas, originally from Lithuania, has scars on the right side of his face and has links across north Cumbria, Liverpool and London.

Jankauskas had been wanted since September 2019.

An appeal for information on his whereabouts was broadcast on the BBC's Crimewatch Roadshow today (19 March).

Anyone with information is asked to contact Cumbria Police on 101.

Alternatively, if you prefer to remain 100% anonymous, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
