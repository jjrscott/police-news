The A66 is currently closed in both directions at Stainmore following a serious road traffic collision this morning (11 Nov).

Police were contacted at around 5.30am to a report of a road traffic collision involving a car and a heavy goods vehicle.

The road is likely to be closed for some time and drivers are asked to avoid the area.

Diversions are being put in place but delays are highly likely.
