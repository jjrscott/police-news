Five men were given Covid-19 Fixed Penalty Notices and are being investigated for poaching offences after being stopped by police in the North Stainmore area at the weekend.

The men were all from different addresses in Carlisle but had travelled in the same car to North Stainmore.

The incident was reported to police shortly before midday on Sunday (17 Jan).

The men were given on the spot Fixed Penalty Notices for breaching Coronavirus restrictions and remain under investigation in relation to poaching offences.

Inspector for Eden, Peter Aiston, said: "Poaching offences are always taken seriously by the Constabulary. However, in this case, the incident is aggravated by the men also breaching the Coronavirus regulations which are in place to stop the spread of the virus here in Cumbria.

"The men were all from separate addresses but travelled together in a single vehicle, putting their own health at risk.

"Cumbria Police would urge anyone with knowledge of poaching offences taking place to contact police immediately."
