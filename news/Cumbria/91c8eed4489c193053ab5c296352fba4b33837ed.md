Wanted: John Smith

Officers are requesting the public's help in locating a man wanted in connection with an attempted rape of a woman committed in the Appleby area in June last year.

John Smith has links across the UK and Ireland and often works as a gardener or scrap metal dealer. Smith also calls himself Jason or Roman and sometimes uses the surname Evans. He also uses different ages, claiming to be 41 or 43.

An appeal for information on his whereabouts was broadcast on the BBC's Crimewatch Roadshow yesterday (10 September).

Anyone with information is asked to contact Cumbria Police on 101.

Alternatively, if you prefer to remain 100% anonymous, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
