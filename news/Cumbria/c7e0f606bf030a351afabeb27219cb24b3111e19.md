Police are appealing for information following an assault in Carlisle.

A male, 17, was assaulted on Dalton Avenue, near the junction with Balfour Road, at about 6.45pm yesterday (July 12).

He was taken to the Cumberland Infirmary in the city with a head injury. His injury is not thought to be life threatening.

Two boys, aged 14 and 16, have been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. They remain in custody today.
