Officers can confirm that they have resolved a reported possession of an imitation firearm incident that occurred in Workington.

Police were alerted at 12.07pm today (8 March) to a photo of a woman, holding what appeared to be a potential firearm in the Vulcans Park area, that had been shared on social media.

Officers were deployed to the area and quickly located a woman who had a toy gun in her possession.

Inspector Annette McClement said:

"We can reassure the local community that the item seen in pictures on social media was a child's toy.

"Our officers responded quickly to the report and we would like to thank people for their vigilance.

"We would urge members of the public to be mindful of carrying items that may mistakenly be deemed as real and that could cause distress to others."
