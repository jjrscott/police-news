Callum Astley

Police in Cumbria have again stressed their commitment to tackling domestic abuse - after a man was jailed for five years following attacks on a woman.

Callum Astley, 28, targeted his victim in a number of assaults while living in Grange-over-Sands last summer.

Following police investigations he has now been jailed.

Officers have urged all victims of such abuse to come forward, saying all incidents will be investigated thoroughly and sensitively.

Astley, of Ellesmere Road, Morecambe, appeared at Preston Crown Court.

He received his sentence after admitting three counts of assault against the woman, as well as a charge of common assault against another person.

The assaults took place on dates in June and July 2020. Astley was arrested and remanded in custody shortly after the offences.

Acting Detective Inspector Scott Elgey said: "Astley is facing the harsh reality of a spell behind bars for the violence he carried out.

"Domestic violence is a priority for Cumbria Constabulary and we take a proactive and sensitive approach to investigating incidents which are reported to us.

 "Anyone experiencing domestic abuse can feel reassured that all reports will be dealt with sensitively and professionally.

"Our officers are committed to tackling all types of domestic abuse, prosecuting those responsible and working with partner agencies to support victims and survivors."

If you have been the victim of domestic abuse, or are concerned for someone who is, you can report this in the safety of your local police station, online at cumbria.police.uk or by calling 101.

Always dial 999 in an emergency.

You can access support services regardless of whether you have reported a crime to the police.

To access support services independently, contact Victim Support 24/7 on 0808 1689 111 - or visit the Cumbria Together website www.cumbriatogether.com.
