Wanted: Sean Cleaver

Officers are requesting the public's help in tracing a man wanted for a number of offences committed in Carlisle.

Sean Cleaver, aged 25, has been wanted since July 2017 for the following offences:

* Robbery

* Attempting to pervert the course of justice

* Offering to supply heroin

The offences are being investigated as part of a wider police operation that resulted in four people being jailed for over 34 years collectively in February 2018.

An appeal for information on Cleaver's whereabouts was broadcast on the BBC's Crimewatch Roadshow today (September 13). He has links to both Cumbria and Merseyside.

Anyone with information on his whereabouts is asked to contact Cumbria Police on 101.
