Wigton shoplifting: Can you identify the person pictured?

Police investigating an incident of shoplifting from a Wigton store have released CCTV images of a person they would like to speak to.

At approximately 2pm on Thursday January 9, a woman entered The Original Factory Shop on Market Place, Wigton, and whilst in the store tried a pair of shoes on. The suspect subsequently walked out of the store without paying for the shoes, leaving behind the footwear she was wearing when she entered the store.

Officers would like to identify the woman responsible and are appealing for the public's help in identifying the suspect.

Anyone with any information is asked to call 101 and ask to speak to PC 2755 Parker or quote incident number 144 of January 9. Alternatively you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
