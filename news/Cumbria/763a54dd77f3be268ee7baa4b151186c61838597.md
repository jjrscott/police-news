Police can confirm that the death of a man who had been in Lake Windermere at Bowness on Wednesday is not being treated as suspicious.

A file is being prepared for the Coroner.

Officers were called to Glebe Road, alongside other emergency services, at 12.52pm on June 12 following concern for the welfare of a man, 57, from Heversham, who had fallen in the water.

Medical professionals provided treatment to the man at the scene.

The North West Ambulance Service and an air ambulance attended but the man subsequently died.
