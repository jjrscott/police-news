Officers are continuing to appeal for witnesses to a fatal collision on Monday 14th October at 11.50am on Southend Road, Penrith in which a woman subsequently died.

In particular officers would like to identify two vehicles in the area at the time of the incident, who could help officers with their investigations.

The vehicles are, a silver BMW estate which stopped at the scene and a dark blue ford SUV type vehicle similar to a Kuga travelling behind the Alfa Romeo involved in the collision.

Officers are continuing to investigate the collision and renew their appeals for anyone who witnessed the collision who has yet to come forward to do so.

Anyone with information regarding these vehicles is asked to contact PC 2230 Taylor from the Mobile Support Group on 101.
