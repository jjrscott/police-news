Cumbria Police are looking to re-employ retired police officers to assist us in making sure that we can continue to provide a high standard of policing in Cumbria during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Superintendent Lisa Hogan said: "If you are a retired officer sat at home at the moment and wondering how you can help in the very challenging time that we are facing right now, we would really like to hear from you.

"It is of the upmost importance to us that we are able to continue serving the people of Cumbria when they need us the most and your help could be really beneficial to the force and to the public.

"If you would like to find out more information about the scheme, please just send us an email or pick up the phone and we will be happy to answer any questions".

Pay and annual leave entitlement on re-appointment will be at the same level as prior to retiring if retuning to the same role, or applicable to the role applied for.

The re-joiners scheme currently only applies to the federated ranks, however, applications from Superintendents will be considered.

If you have already retired from policing or are due to be retiring shortly and are interested in getting involved in helping keep Cumbria safe, then please visit our website here: https://www.cumbria.police.uk/Recruiting/Jobs/Vacancies/Transferee.aspx

If you have a question about the scheme you can email us here: policeofficerrecruit@cumbria.police.uk
