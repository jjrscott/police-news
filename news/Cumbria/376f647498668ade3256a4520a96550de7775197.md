Officers are asking the public to remain vigilant following a report of a series of scam calls, to members of the public in Cumbria from fraudsters pretending to be police officers. The Fraudsters have asked for money to be transferred and for cash to be withdrawn at the bank ready for collection.

Kendal Detectives were made aware that this week that a fraudster called a landline number requesting the victim to withdraw money, the victim has then withdrawn the money and a female has come to the house and collected the money in person. Enquires are ongoing to identify this female.

Advice from local officers is as follows:-

If you receive a call you're not expecting, you should be suspicious. The vital things to remember are that your bank and the police would:

• Never ask you for your bank account details or PIN number over the phone.

• Never ask you to withdraw money and send it to them via a courier, taxi or by any other means.

• Never ask you to send your bank cards, or any other personal property, to them via courier, taxi or by any other means.

We ask that the public please share this information with any vulnerable friends or family.

If you think you have been the victim of a fraud you can report this to police on 101 and to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 - or by visiting their website at https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/"
