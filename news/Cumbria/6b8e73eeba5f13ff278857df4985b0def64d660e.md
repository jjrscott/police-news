Detectives in Carlisle are currently investigating a burglary where large quantities of a prescription only drug were stolen.

Large amounts of Pregabalin, were stolen from Well Pharmacy in the Fusehill Street area of Carlisle, overnight, between the 13th and 14th of March.

"Please take a good look at the packaging in the picture and if you are offered these drugs or see anyone acting suspiciously in possession of these drugs, please report your concerns immediately to police.

"Anyone who thinks they've taken any of these drugs should go straight to A&E and take the packaging with them."
