Carlisle Racecourse is to host an Emergency Services Road Safety Day this weekend.

The event is on Sunday (25 Aug), officially opening at 10am, is FREE to all and attractions on the day include drone exercises, Fire Service extractions from crashed cars and two question and answer sessions with professional British Superbikes rider Keith Farmer.

Inspector Steve Minnikin said: "This is the first such event we've organised in the county and we're making sure there's going to be something for everyone, from petrol heads to young children.

"It's a free event and if the public come out and support it there's every chance it will become a regular feature on the summer calendar."

The aim of the event is to help raise awareness of road safety issues across the county.

Dozens of organisations are offer their support and attending the event including Great North Air Ambulance, Penrith Mountain Rescue, NWAS, Cumbria Fire and Rescue and a host of driver and motorcycle training agencies.

There will also be stalls, as well as other attractions including classic cars and the police car from the film Hot Fuzz.

Inspector Minnikin said: "It's going to be a day people will enjoy but will also help give people a better understanding of road safety."
