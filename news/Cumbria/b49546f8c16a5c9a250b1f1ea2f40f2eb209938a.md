Two males have been charged with offences as part of the ongoing investigation into the death of 26-year-old Carlisle man Lee McKnight.

A 17-year-old boy, from Carlisle, has been charged with assisting an offender.

Arron Graham, 25, of Blackwell Road, Carlisle, has been charged with threats to kill, unrelated to the murder.

Both will appear at North Cumbria Magistrates' Court today (8 August).
