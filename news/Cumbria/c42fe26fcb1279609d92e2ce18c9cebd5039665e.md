A Cumbria police officer has been putting his exercise time during the ongoing restrictions to good use - by running 10 kilometres a day to raise cash for charity.

PC Chris Bardini has been limbering up and hitting the road for a socially-distanced run with a friend every day during March to raise the funds for Carlisle Eden Mind.

It means by the end of the month he and Rich Aldersey will have run a combined total of about 400 miles - the equivalent distance of travelling from north Cumbria to Plymouth on the south coast.

They have been documenting the challenge on social media, raising Â£1,300 to date - and getting a shout-out on Zoe Ball's Radio 2 Breakfast Show in the process.

Chris, who is based in Carlisle for his police duties, said: "When I joined Cumbria Constabulary back in 2009 I completed a two-week community attachment with Carlisle Eden Mind.

"It is a charity that I have been aware of for some time and one that's close to my heart.

"Now, more than ever, mental health seems to be something that affects parts of society.

"So my friend Rich and I decided now was the perfect time to raise both awareness of and funds for a very worthy local charity, which provides an excellent service."

The duo have been documenting their fundraising on social media.

Chris added: "The reaction on social media has been amazing and very positive.

"With every day that passes the miles seem longer and our legs feel heavier.

"We both have aches in places that we didn't know existed on our bodies.

"But the donations and messages of support that we are receiving on social media are helping to ease the pain and keep us motivated.

"We hope any raising of awareness will encourage people to seek help if they feel they may be suffering from mental health issues and also encourage people to exercise safely and in a socially-distanced manner, following the Covid-19 guidelines, to help their wellbeing."

Chris and Rich have set up a fundraising page, which you can access here: www.justgiving.com/fundraising/10kdown.
