A Barrow man has been jailed for breaching the terms of his sexual risk order.

Ben Herdman, aged 20, of Park Avenue, was sentenced on Friday (February 14) at Preston Crown Court to 16 months imprisonment.

Herdman was arrested at his home address after he was found in possession of a phone capable of accessing the internet as well as taking and storing digital images. The conditions of his order prohibited Herdman from having a phone unless he provided it for inspection upon police request.

A previous community order was revoked by the judge who sentenced Herdman for previous breaches.

Detective Constable Lyndsey Mitchell said:

"The conditions of Herdman's sexual risk order were made clear to him on a number of occasions. Upon visiting his address we found a phone, which could access the internet, hidden under a pillow in his bedroom.

"The conditions of such an order are there to protect the public and it is only right that Herdman has been brought to justice for this latest breach."
