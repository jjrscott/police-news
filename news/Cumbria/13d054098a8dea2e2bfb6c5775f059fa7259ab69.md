A multi-agency rescue operation has successfully rescued four kayakers who had got into difficulty in Derwent Water.

Police were alerted to an incident shortly after 5.50pm this evening (22 October) after four kayakers had reportedly capsized.

A swift operation involving police, Cumbria Fire & Rescue Service and Keswick Mountain Rescue Team successfully rescued all four men.

The men, who suffered no reported injuries, were subsequently taken to Penrith Hospital to be checked over.
