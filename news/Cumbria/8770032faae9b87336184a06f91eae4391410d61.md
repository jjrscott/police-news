Police are promoting some simple tips to protect yourself from cashpoint fraud as the tourist season continues to step up a gear.

Lake District towns have previously been targets for tactics such as "skimming", where details are copied, as visitor numbers increase.

As a result officers are encouraging people to think about how they use ATMs.

Detective Constable John Robinson investigates fraud at Cumbria Police.

He said: "Fraudsters are becoming more sophisticated in their methods of trying to steal funds from bank accounts.

"A few simple tips such as those below will help protect yourself."

* Use ATMs in well-lit and busy areas, particularly after nightfall.

* Preferably use an ATM located indoors, in a bank or building society branch, or one that is monitored by CCTV.

* Check over the cash machine before using it. Many ATM fraudsters use tactics such as placing false fronts over the card slot to copy, or skim, your details. If anything looks "stuck on", it probably is.

* If you have suspicions that a machine may have been tampered with, avoid using the machine and report your concerns to the machine's owner immediately.

* Protect your PIN - always place your hand over the keypad to act as a shield while inputting your PIN.
