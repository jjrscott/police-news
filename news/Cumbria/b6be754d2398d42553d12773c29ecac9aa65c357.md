Two men have been issued with Sexual Risk Orders which set out to reduce the risk they pose to other women and girls

Darrell Stephen Carter, 28, who is currently held at Durham Prison but originally from Carlisle, is now subject of an indefinite order which prohibits him from contacting girls under the age of 18. The order also places restrictions on his accessibility to devices which have access to the internet or can store digital images.

Carter's order was issued at North Cumbria Magistrates' Court on 15 September.

A separate Sexual Risk Order has also been granted yesterday (16 September) for 23-year-old Carlisle man Ryan Batey. A two-year order was imposed at North Cumbria Magistrates' Court prohibiting him to contact or arrange to meet sex workers. The order also places restrictions on his accessibility to devices which have access to the internet.

Detective Inspector Andy Teasdale said:

"These civil orders place stringent restrictions on the person subject to them and will help protect women and girls who they may try to exploit.

"Both men were identified as being a risk of sexual harm to vulnerable females. Due to the hard work and dedication by detectives and the Constabulary's legal team, we have successfully been granted these orders which will allow our officers to manage both individuals and the risk they pose.

"Any breaches by either individual of their respective order will constitute a criminal offence which we will progress through the courts."
