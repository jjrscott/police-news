ACC Andrew Slattery

One of Cumbria's most senior police officers this week accepted his Master of Science award from the University of Cumbria at a ceremony at Carlisle Cathedral,

Assistant Chief Constable Andrew Slattery has spent the last two years completing his MSc in Strategic Policing, picking up his scroll 29 years after graduating from Lancaster University with a degree in sociology.

ACC Slattery said: "For the first year of my master's degree I was also going through a process to become Assistant Chief Constable. I was Detective Chief Superintendent (Head of Crime) at Cumbria Constabulary at the time, which is a demanding role in itself. Juggling work and study commitments can be difficult but it is possible and well worth the effort.

"It has been of real benefit professionally and personally, helping to develop me. At work, I'm very busy operationally, helping to run a large organisation and helping to protect the public from threat, risk and harm on a daily basis.

"This has allowed me to step out of that operational side of things and come back to the fundamental issues about why we do what we do, the role of the police and ethical issues."

He added: "It was a challenge coming back to academic study and writing after so long away. Academic study, research and presentations are different disciplines to what you may do in other parts of your life. You have to be disciplined to get back into the way of learning also, but it has really focussed me."

Mr Slattery, a former pupil of Keswick School, carried out research into career progression for men and women in the police service as part of his course.
