Police are appealing for anyone who might have seen missing teenager Declan Burney, 16, to contact them.

Declan has been missing from Merseyside since Sunday (September 1) but has a lot of connections to Whitehaven and west Cumbria.

It is believed he is in the Whitehaven area.

Anyone with information about Declan's whereabouts are asked to contact officers on 101.

If Declan sees this appeal himself he is asked to call police on the same number.
