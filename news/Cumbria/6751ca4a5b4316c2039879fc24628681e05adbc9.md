Police in North and West Cumbria are continuing their appeal following the launch of Operation Nobble in early June which was launched to tackle the theft of motor vehicles specifically quads bikes and motorbikes. The operation has seen an increase in patrols in the affected areas.

This week has seen more areas targeted overnight from the 25th June into the 26th with several quad bikes and motorbikes taken.

**Dalston** - Entry forced to a garage and three quad bikes taken. Property outstanding.

**Greystokes** - Quad bike taken from unsecure farm building.

**Garrigill** - Attempted theft of a quad bike from secure building.

Detective Inspector Andrew Donnelly said:

"I would urge anyone in the affected areas to remain vigilant day or night to persons in the area acting suspiciously and take simple steps to secure their property.

"Officers will continue to patrol across the area to provide reassurance to victims and communities, however, to assist us in our efforts to apprehend these criminals, please report any suspicious activity or vehicles they see to the police.

"Anyone who has any information can contact police on 101 or call CrimeStoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."

Security advice:

* Ensure that all outbuildings are locked when not in use

* Reverse the hinges on shed doors so that they cannot be unscrewed

* Fit British Standard locks with strong locking bars to doors and windows. If padlocks are used make sure they are robust

* Lock tools and machinery away and out of sight when not in use as they could be taken or used to gain access to surrounding buildings.

* Don't leave keys or valuables in farm vehicles and machinery

* Always keep gates padlocked shut

* Security mark tools and valuables are security

* Install sensor controlled 'dusk till dawn' security lights

* Consider CCTV as additional security for vulnerable areas

* Consider an audible and monitored intruder alarm system

* Consider installing tracking devices to vehicles
