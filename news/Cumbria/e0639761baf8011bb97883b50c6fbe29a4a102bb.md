_The following has been released on behalf of Cumbria Local Resilience Forum_

Businesses in Cumbria are being invited to support the national effort to increase the supply of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).

The Cumbria PPE Manufacturing Challenge has been launched by the Business and Economic Response and Recovery Group (BERRG) of the Local Resilience Forum, which is responsible for developing the business and economy response to COVID-19.

Assistant Chief Constable Andrew Slattery is chair of Cumbria's Local Resilience Forum.

He said: "Increasing the amount of PPE available will keep front-line health and social care staff safe during the Covid-19 outbreak and help slow the spread of the virus.

"There are already some great examples of local, Cumbria businesses using the skill and expertise of their workforce to help make a difference.

"However, demand for Personal Protective Equipment will not subside any time soon and any business who is able to assist in the manufacture of such items will be potentially saving the lives of local people."

The Government has released **specifications** for the production of such equipment which can be found here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technical-specifications-for-personal-protective-equipment-ppe
