Police are advising motorists that an abnormal load will be driven along the M6 and A66 in Cumbria tomorrow morning (Aug 7).

The load will travel south along the M6 before joining the A66 at junction 40 of the motorway at about 9.30am.

It is expected traffic flow on the A66 may be affected up to about midday as it moves to the A1 at Scotch Corner.

Police are asking motorists to be patient or find an alternative route if possible.

The stretch on the A66 is being driven outside of peak traffic time.

Officers have thanked motorists for their patience in advance.
