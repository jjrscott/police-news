At about 7.35pm last night (July 16) a collision took place on Warwick Road, Carlisle.

The driver of a black Audi then left the scene.

The vehicle was located a short time later and failed to stop for police patrols.

The incident was eventually brought to a tactical conclusion on Victoria Viaduct.

A man, 36, has been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and robbery.

He remains in custody today.

Any witnesses are asked to contact PS 1461 Sampson of Cumbria Mobile Support Group on 101.
