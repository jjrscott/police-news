Concerns are growing for a missing 56-year-old man from Carlisle.

Grahame Vallance was last seen on Friday morning (December 27). Further inquiries by officers have established that he visited the Dawson & Sanderson branch, in the city centre, at 1pm that afternoon.

He was wearing a red hat, dark jeans and puffer jacket. He had a green sleeping bag with him as well as a small-hold suitcase on wheels.

Police are appealing for anyone with information on Mr Vallance's whereabouts to get in touch by calling 101.
