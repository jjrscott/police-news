Police have this evening charged Adrian William Hughes, 63, of Broad Close, Barrow, with murder.

Police were called to Broad Close in Barrow on Friday evening (June 12) following a report that a man had been stabbed.

The man who subsequently died has been formally identified as David Greenall, 48.

Mr Greenall's family paid tribute to him today by saying: "We had some really good times with David and have fond memories. He will be sadly missed".

Detective Chief Inspector Furzana Nazir said:

"My team of detectives continue to work on this murder investigation. I can confirm that a number of witnesses have come forward. However, if you were in the area of Broad Close on Friday 12th June between 7pm and 8.30pm and detectives have not spoken to you, I would like you to make contact with the police.

"It is vitally important for anyone with information or any witnesses to come forward to help us with our enquiries.

"A family liaison officer continues to support the family and we ask that they are given privacy to come to terms with the sudden and unexpected death of their loved one."

Hughes was refused bail and will appear at Barrow Magistrates court tomorrow morning (16th June).

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting log 198 of 12th June. Alternatively you can attend Barrow Police Station or call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
