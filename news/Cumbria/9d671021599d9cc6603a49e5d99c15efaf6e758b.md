Luke Atkinson

A schoolboy has received a Commendation from the Chief Constable tonight (20 May) after helping police officers safely locate a missing person.

On Wednesday, 1 August 2018, officers were in Kendal asking members of the public if they had seen a man they were worried may be planning to take his own life.

Luke Atkinson, 13, a pupil at Kirkbie Kendal School, was one of those approached by officers. Whilst Luke had not seen the man, he made sure to remember the face.

Later in the day Luke spotted a man matching the description, near to the river.

Not only did he swiftly dial 999 but he was also able to stay in the area and watch the man's movements from a safe distance until officers arrived at the scene.

Inspector Jo Fawcett said: "Luke's actions were remarkable for one so young and we are extremely grateful to have members of the public like him who can help us find vulnerable missing people.

"His quick decision to call 999 was pivotal to allowing officers to get to the man in time, whilst his staying close by also meant he could guide officers to the exact location.

"Without Luke's mature and responsible actions that day, this search for this man could easily have ended in tragedy. He is a credit to his family, school and to the county of Cumbria."
