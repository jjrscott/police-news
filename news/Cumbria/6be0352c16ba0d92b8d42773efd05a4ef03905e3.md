Leon Blaney

A man who was found dead yesterday afternoon (23 June) at an address in Workington, has been identified as 39-year-old Workington man George Leon Blaney, known to family and friends as 'Leon'.

Mr Blaney's family paid tribute to him today by saying:

"Leon was a gentle giant and a good friend to many. We have taken comfort from the thousands of messages we have received and we would like to request privacy at this difficult time"

Police were called at 1.25pm yesterday (23 June) with a report of the sudden death of a man inside a property on Garnet Crescent, Salterbeck. Police and paramedics attended and Mr Blaney was pronounced dead at the scene.

A 37-year-old man was subsequently arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody for questioning.
