Louise Challinor

A woman who has regularly stolen from shops in Carlisle has been made subject of a Criminal Behaviour Order.

Louise Challinor, 40, of Coleville Terrace was issued a two year community order on the 11th February at Carlisle Magistrates Court.

The order that will last for two years has conditions:

• Not to enter any premises part of the Carlisle Shopwatch/Retailers against crime scheme

• Not to enter any retail premises on St Nicholas Gate retail park, Carlisle

**PC Heidi Underwood, Carlisle Local Focus Team, said:**

"This CBO was a great outcome, Challinor is a prolific shoplifter and I hope that the conditions will allow her to reflect on and change her behaviour.

"CBOs are a useful tool available to the courts which can help the offender to cease further criminality and help protect residents.

"In this instance, the court agreed with our application for the order regarding a persistent offender who we continually have to deal with which takes away resources to those that genuinely require the help of officers.

"I would encourage anyone who witnesses the terms of such a court order being broken to contact the police immediately. The punishment for breaking the terms of a CBO can be up to five years in prison."
