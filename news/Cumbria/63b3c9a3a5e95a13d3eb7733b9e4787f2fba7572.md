Police are appealing for witnesses following a collision in Penrith.

Officers were called at 11.48am following a report of a collision involving a pedestrian and a car in Victoria Road.

The pedestrian, a woman, 77, sustained serious injuries and was taken by air ambulance to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, where she was in a serious condition.

The car involved was an Alfa Romeo, driven by a woman, 46, of Penrith.

Closures were put in place while investigations were carried out. These have since been lifted.
Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101.
