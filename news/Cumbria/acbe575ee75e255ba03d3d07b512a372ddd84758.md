A woman has been arrested in connection with a reported scam in the Kendal area which is seeking the public to donate money and gifts.

Officers received a report of fraud following a post which has circulated on Facebook requesting donations to a family in Kendal who had lost possessions in a house fire. There is no evidence of any such fire to have taken place and officers advise the public to not make any donations to this particular request.

A 33-year-old woman from Kendal was arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation, she has subsequently been released under investigation whilst officers conduct further enquiries.

Officers are appealing for anyone who believes they have been victim to this reported scam and have donated items to contact them.

Anyone with information is urged to contact police on 101 or email 101@cumbria.police.uk, quoting incident number 86 of 22 December. Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
