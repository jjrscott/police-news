People will be able to get top tips on staying clear of cybercrime in the run-up to Christmas and beyond in an online surgery hosted by Cumbria Police tomorrow (December 10).

Our cyber experts will be available to give advice on the constabulary's Instagram account to help stop you falling victim to fraud and other online crimes.

It can cover subjects such as online shopping, scam emails, safe passwords, Ransomware - or whatever questions on the topic of cybercrime you want to pose.

Niall McNicholas, cyber dependent crime specialist, said: "Many of us are using online services more and more - to shop, communicate and go about our everyday business.

"This means we could all fall victim to cybercrime. However, some simple steps can significantly reduce your chance of becoming a victim.

"We will be online to answer your questions and give out advice that could help stop you losing money or being targeted by cyber fraudsters."

_The event will take place on our Instagram page via Stories between 9am and 4pm. To take part search 'cumbriacops'._

_For those without Instagram, we 'll also be posting information on our Facebook page on a post which will be pinned to the top of our page from 9am onwards._
