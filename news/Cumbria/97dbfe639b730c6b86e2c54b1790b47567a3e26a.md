Police are investigating after a number of vehicles and properties were damaged in west Cumbria.

The damage was carried out during at least 10 incidents overnight last night into today (Thursday May 23).

Cars were mostly targeted - with windows damaged on these vehicles - but a number of windows at homes were also damaged.

During each incident the damage was caused by an air weapon.

It is believed whoever did this has done so while driving around in a car.

There have been no reports of anybody being injured.

The damage was carried out at places including Moor Row, Parton, High Harrington, Salterbeck, Distington and Workington.

Police are appealing for information.

Anyone with information should call PC 2368 Kearns on 101, referring to incident 264 of May 22.
