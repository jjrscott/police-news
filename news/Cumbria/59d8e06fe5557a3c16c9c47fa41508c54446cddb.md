Police have made an arrest after a man suffered a head injury near Carlisle city centre in the early hours of this morning (June 8).

Officers have arrested a man, aged in his twenties, from Carlisle, on suspicion of grievous bodily harm. He remains in custody tonight.

An investigation was launched after officers were called to Robert Street, which leads from Crown Street, off Botchergate, by the North West Ambulance Service at 4.54am.

A 55-year-old man, from Carlisle, had suffered a head injury and was taken to hospital.
He is currently at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle in a critical condition.

Officers are continuing to appeal for information.

They would like anybody who may have been passing by this area at about this time to come forward.

The injured man is 5ft 9ins tall, of very stocky build.

He was wearing a pale blue short-sleeved patterned shirt with a dark bodywarmer on top, dark blue jeans and Chelsea boots.

A police spokesman said: "If anyone was in the area of Robert Street, James Street and Crown Street, between 4am and 5am, they are asked to think back and see if they remember anything that might help our investigation.

"Please contact us if you have any information that might assist the inquiry."

If you have any information, please call 101, referring to log 51 of June 8.
