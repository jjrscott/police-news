Jonathon Fell

A man subject to an order to protect the public has been jailed for nearly four years - after officers monitoring him caught him out when he committed a string of offences.

Jonathon Fell's crimes were uncovered when the team managing him in the community acted on suspicions raised and seized his mobile phone.

Fell, 23, is subject to a Sexual Harm Prevention Order and was arrested for possessing an internet-enabled phone that breached conditions of this order.

Analysis revealed a number of messages of an indecent nature.

Fell, of no fixed abode, appeared before Carlisle Crown Court.

He admitted four counts of attempting to engage in sexual communication with a child and four counts of attempting to cause or incite a child to engage in sexual activity.

Fell was jailed for a total of 45 months.

He was managed in the community by the MOSOVO (Management of Sexual and Violent Offenders) Unit, who worked together with detectives from the Crime and Safeguarding Team to bring Fell before the court.

Speaking after the case, Detective Chief Inspector Matt Scott said: "This sentence demonstrates that cases of this nature are taken very seriously.

"If offenders choose to breach orders they are subject to, they will be prosecuted and brought to justice.

"This should reassure the public that we are actively managing people with Sexual Harm Prevention Orders."
