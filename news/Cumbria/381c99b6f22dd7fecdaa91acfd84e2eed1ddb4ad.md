Detectives are continuing their appeal for information following a shop robbery in Workington on Wednesday night (28 October).

An investigation is underway after an unknown male offender walked into the McColl's shop on Harrington Road at approximately 11pm and threatened two staff members with a knife before leaving the premises with a small amount of money.

Detective Constable James Graham said:

"CCTV footage from the shop has now been reviewed and we would like to speak to the person pictured in the attached image as part of our investigation.

"I would also like to appeal to the public to contact us if you may be able to assist with identifying this person. However, we would advise the public not to approach this person if spotted and instead contact the police.

"I would like to reiterate that incidents such as this are rare in this area and we are doing all we can to locate the suspect."

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting incident number 258 of the 28 October. Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
