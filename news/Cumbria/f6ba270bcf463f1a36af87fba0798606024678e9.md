Wanted: Paul Redpath

Officers are requesting the public's help in locating a 48-year-old man wanted for breaching his sexual harm prevention order by failing to maintain contact with police.

Paul Hunter Redpath, who has a Scottish accent, has links across Scotland, the north of England, Cornwall and Belfast.

He is known to use the names James McInley and Jordan Macpherson.

An appeal for information on his whereabouts was broadcast on the BBC's Crimewatch Roadshow today (September 23).

Anyone with information is asked to contact Cumbria Police on 101.

Alternatively, if you prefer to remain 100% anonymous, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
