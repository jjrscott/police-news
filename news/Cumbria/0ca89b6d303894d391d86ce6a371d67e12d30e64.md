Jailed: Arthur O'Leary & Michael Stokes

Two men have been jailed following an investigation into a burglary that occurred in Melmerby.

Michael John Stokes, 29, and Arthur O'Leary, 35, were sentenced at Carlisle Crown Court today (16 March).

The burglary occurred on the evening of 7 February, where Stokes and O'Leary forced entry to a house before stealing jewellery, watches, cash and clothing. The pair were seen leaving the property by a local resident who noted down the registration number of a Vauxhall Astra, which the offenders made off in.

Local officers were quickly made aware of the incident and stopped the vehicle in Appleby. A search of the vehicle found many of the items stolen from the address in Melmerby.

Stokes, of Westmorland Rise, Appleby, admitted the offence at court and was jailed for three years. O'Leary, of no fixed address, was also handed a three-year custodial sentence after pleading guilty to burglary.

Judge Nicholas Barker commended the witness for his actions.

Detective Constable Dawn Grant, North Crime and Safeguarding Team, said:

"We are pleased that these two men have been jailed.

"They stole from a pensioner who had not long left his home and had secured his property.

"I would like to thank the witness who acted quickly to note down the vehicle registration number, which was of great assistance to our officers who were able to quickly locate the pair. His vigilance has not only led to these men being brought to justice, but sends a clear message to criminals that our communities look out for each other."
