Two Workington brothers who carried out a spate of burglaries in Seaton at the beginning of lockdown have been jailed following sentencing at Carlisle Crown Court.

Billy Joe Blacklock, 24, of no fixed address, received a three year and five months prison sentence for one count of burglary, one count of theft, and one count of violent behaviour in a police station.

Ross Blacklock, 20, of Newlands Gardens, Workington, received four years detention in a young offender's institution, after being found guilty of three counts of burglary and theft and one count of possession of cannabis.

On the evening of the 21st March 2020, into the early hours of the 22nd March, the brothers raided four properties in the Seaton area, taking approximately Â£1,900 worth of property from the homes in total, which included items such as laptops, mobile phones, handbags, a lawn mower and cash.

On Saturday 22nd March, both brothers were arrested and subsequently charged, with some of the stolen property being recovered by officers.

Detective Sergeant Tom Windridge said:

"I am happy with these sentences and I would like to thank the residents of Seaton for their assistance in the investigation.

"This sentencing should send a strong message to anyone considering getting involved in such crime that they could end up facing time in prison.

"We will not tolerate burglars targeting properties as people should be able to feel safe in their own homes."
