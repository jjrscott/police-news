Two Carlisle men were arrested yesterday morning (1 October) on suspicion of money laundering and drug offences following a search warrant carried out by officers in the city.

Officers from the Local Focus team recovered a large number of cannabis plants from a property in the Scalegate Road area of Currock, as well as further evidence which was seized from a second property on Henderson Road.

A 28-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of the cultivation of cannabis and has since been released under investigation.

A 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of money laundering and possession of criminal property and has since been released on police bail.

Sergeant Carol Black of the North Neighbourhood Policing Team said:

"This is a positive result for the residents of Currock. The property on Scalegate Road is only a short distance from Hammonds Pond cafe and the children's play park, where visitors to the park have had to put up with a very strong smell of cannabis on a daily basis, as well as the implications of having to live close by to those involved with drug supply, which has a big impact on our local communities.

"I would like to encourage the public to continue to report any concerns they have about such activity to police by calling 101, or alternatively by calling Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
