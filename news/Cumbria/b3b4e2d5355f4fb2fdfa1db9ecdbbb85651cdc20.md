A Carlisle drink driver has been disqualified from the road for 26 months.

Daniel Balmer, aged 32, was found guilty at a hearing at South Cumbria Magistrates' Court last week (August 29) for failing to provide a specimen for analysis following an incident last month.

Police were alerted to a motorist driving erratically in the area of Brettargh Holt in the early hours of Saturday 10th August. Balmer was stopped by police on the M6 northbound near to junction 39 when driving a black Mini. He provided a roadside sample of 103 micrograms per 100 millilitres of breath - nearly three times the legal limit of 35 micrograms.

Balmer failed to provide a sufficient volume of breath upon his arrival at Kendal Police Station.

PC Simon Smith, South Cumbria Mobile Support Group, said:

"We are pleased that Balmer has been taken off the county's roads. His actions that night were extremely dangerous as he attempted to drive back to Carlisle from Ulverston.

"Driving under the influence of alcohol severely impacts your ability to drive safely and respond to potential obstructions on the road. Fortunately on this occasion nobody was harmed because of a drink driver's actions.

"I hope that Balmer's disqualification sends a clear message to those who would consider driving under the influence. The danger you cause yourself, your passengers and other road users is extreme and can result in the loss of life."

Balmer, of Southwell Square, Carlisle, was also ordered to pay Â£175 in costs and to carry out 100 hours unpaid work.
