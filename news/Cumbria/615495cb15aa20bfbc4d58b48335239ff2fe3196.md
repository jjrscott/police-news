Darren Hilland

The work of west Cumbrian detectives has led to a man being jailed following burglaries in Workington last week.

Officers launched investigations followingburglaries in the early hours of the 4th July.

Darren Hilland, 38, from Lakeland View, Workington appeared at North and West Cumbria Magistrates on the 6th July and pleaded guilty to two counts of burglary and breach of a criminal behaviour order.

Hilland has been jailed for 18 weeks.

Police spokeswoman said,

"We will not tolerate burglars targeting any kind of properties.

"Those who do so can expect to face a police investigation and prosecution.

"Businesses provide employment and contribute to the west Cumbrian economy.

"An attack on them is not a victimless crime - it hits people's livelihoods."
