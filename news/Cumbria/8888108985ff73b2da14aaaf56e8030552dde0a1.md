Christopher Bould

A man has been jailed for 30 months for an assault on a child.

Christopher Bould, 32, of Buxton House, Huddersfield was sentenced today (July 26) at Carlisle Crown Court for assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

The victim of the assault suffered multiple injuries and a perforated ear drum.

Detective Constable Ian Garratt said,

"Throughout the investigation the offender has continually denied the allegation put against him.

Over the last few days the jury has heard the evidence and it was very clear that Chris Bould had committed a cowardly act of attacking a 4-year-old sleeping child to vent his drunken anger.

The child suffered a perforated ear drum and bruising over his face and neck. I am pleased with the verdict of the jury, and I would encourage anybody in a situation where abuse is taking place at the home to step forwards and report it to the police." ****
