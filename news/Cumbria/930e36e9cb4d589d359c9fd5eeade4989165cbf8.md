A public appeal has been launched by detectives in Carlisle as part of their enquiries into a sexual assault investigation.

Officers are appealing for information on two men who were riding mountain bikes in the area of the B&M store on Wigton Road, between 2:45am and 5am today (29 September).

The victim, aged in her 20s, is being supported by officers as enquiries continue to establish the full circumstances of the incident.

Detective Chief Inspector Jenny Beattie, North Cumbria Crime and Safeguarding Team, said:

"We are seeking the public's help as part of an investigation into a sexual assault which was reported to have occurred in the Wigton Road area.

"Specifically, we would like to hear from anyone who witnessed two men riding mountain bikes in the area between 2:45am and 5am.

"The victim is being supported by trained officers at this time and a team of detectives are undertaking a range of investigative enquiries.

"I would like to reassure the public that incidents such as this are rare and everything is being conducted to establish what has happened and who is involved.

"I would also like to appeal to local residents who may have footage, such as CCTV, dashcam or door-bell cameras, which may have captured two men on bikes."

Anyone with information should contact police by calling 101 and ask to speak to an officer from the North Cumbria Crime and Safeguarding Team, quoting incident number 36 of 29 September. Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
