Agencies are continuing to assess the impact caused by an issue with mains water in the Shap area.

A multi-agency meeting took place this evening (10 February) to assess the situation in order to ensure public safety.

The current advice by United Utilities for residents in Shap, and some of the surrounding villages, is **NOT** to drink mains water until further notice. To see whether your property is impacted, please check the affected postcodes by clicking here.

The company also says do **NOT** use your tap water for cleaning teeth, washing or cooking. People can continue to use tap water for flushing the toilet. Up to 400 properties are affected in Shap and villages to the east as far as Great Asby. United Utilities has issued this advice as a precaution after detecting higher levels of chlorine than usual in part of the supply network. Engineers are taking steps to flush this water away.

United Utilities will continue to keep their customers informed of any changes to their water supply.

United Utilities has opened free bottled water collection points at the following locations:

• Shap Memorial Hall, Shap, Penrith, CA10 3NL

• Broad Close Car Park, Appleby-in-Westmorland

• Tebay Services (Northbound), Westmorland Place, Orton, CA10 3SB

Additional bottled water stations are also located at:

• Pooley Bridge Village Hall, Pooley Bridge, Penrith, CA10 2NL

• Market Square, Kirkby Stephen, CA17 4QN

• Clifton Village Hall, Clifton, Penrith, CA10 2EA
