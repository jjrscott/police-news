Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was kicked off her push bike on the cycle path between Dalston and Carlisle.

The assault occurred close to Dalston Sewage Works at approximately 8:15am today (June 3)

The suspect is described as a white man, medium build wearing a black coloured face mask, black hooded top and camouflage trousers.

Officers are interested in anyone who was on the cycle path this morning who may have seen a man matching this description.

Officers are particularly interested in speaking to a couple in their 50s or 60s who were walking a dog in the area in the direction of Dalston at the time of the incident.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact police on 101, email 101@cumbria.police.uk, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, quoting log 46 of the 3rd June 2020.
