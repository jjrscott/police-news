Jonathan MacMillan

A man who killed his father in a property in South Cumbria has today (Dec 3) been given an indefinite hospital order under section 37 of the mental health act with restrictions under section 41 of the same act.

Jonathan MacMillan, 28, of Provincial Street, Barrow, pleaded not guilty to murder on the 8th November at an earlier hearing but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. MacMillan was today (Dec 3) given an indefinite hospital order at Preston Crown Court, he will be detained in a secure hospital for treatment.

Police were called by NWAS following a call they received on the 18th June at approximately 6:40pm to the report of a man having been stabbed at a property on Provincial Street.

Paramedics attended the property and called police believing it was a crime scene. The man, John MacMillian was pronounced dead at the scene.

Jonathan was at the property on Provincial Street when the emergency services arrived and was taken into custody and arrested later that day on suspicion of murder.

Detective Superintendent David Pattinson said:

"I would like to thank those officers who initially responded to the 999 call and the team that subsequently worked thoroughly and professionally on a difficult investigation in order to secure this result at court today.

"There are no winners here today, this is a tragic set of circumstances that has obviously had a devastating and profound impact on the family. Our thoughts are with them at this time."
