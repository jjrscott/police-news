Police in Penrith have made a seizure that could have stopped up to 200 deals of class A drugs making their way onto the streets of the town.

Officers from Eden and Penrith's Proactive Team made the seizure of substances - along with the seizure of cash - following searches of a vehicle and an address in Penrith.

The team acted following concerns about suspected drug supply being spotted in Elm Terrace, Penrith, at about 3pm on Saturday (March 14).

A man, 41, from the Penrith area, was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs.

He was released under investigation while inquiries continue.

A police spokesman said: "Cumbria Constabulary are committed to targeting the supply of illegal drugs.

"Anyone with any information is encouraged to report any suspicious activity to 101 - or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 101."
