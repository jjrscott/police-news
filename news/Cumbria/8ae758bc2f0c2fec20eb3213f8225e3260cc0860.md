Paul Wright

A man who sexually abused a boy while he himself was a teenager has been jailed for more than two-and-a-half years.

Paul Wright, 49, was found guilty by a jury at Carlisle Crown Court of a serious sexual assault on the boy during the 1980s in west Cumbria.

He was found not guilty of three other serious sexual assault charges.

Today Wright, of Abbey Street, Carlisle, was sentenced to 31 months imprisonment and placed on the Sex Offenders' Register indefinitely.

Speaking after the case, Detective Constable James Graham said: "Cumbria Constabulary takes all reports of abuse seriously.

"We continue to urge anyone who was a victim of abuse to report it - no matter how long ago.

"All victims are treated professionally and sensitively, with dignity and respect."

Contact police on 101.
