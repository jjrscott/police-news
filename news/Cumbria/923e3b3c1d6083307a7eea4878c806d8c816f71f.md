Claire Marie Moore

A shoplifter who regularly stole from Tesco in Workington has been banned from entering all branches of the supermarket in Cumbria.

Claire Marie Moore, 38, of Scalebeck Court, Workington, has been issued with a Criminal Behaviour Order at Workington's magistrates' court.

The order lasts for two years. Moore is prohibited from entering any Tesco store in Cumbria.

If she does not comply with this order she could face arrest and imprisonment.

Moore has appeared before the courts a number of times where she has been prosecuted for theft.

PC Leesa Edwards, a problem solving officer for Allerdale Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "Working with the Crown Prosecution Service we've been able to obtain this order.

"Criminal Behaviour Orders are useful tools available to the courts which can assist the offender to cease further criminality and help protect local businesses.

"I would encourage anyone who witnesses the terms of such a court order being broken to contact the police immediately."
