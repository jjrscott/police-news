Aaron Blackburn

Three teenagers have been sentenced today following a robbery at a Carlisle shop.

Aaron Blackburn, 18, of Queens Road, Kendal, admitted robbery.

A 17-year-old from Blackpool also admitted robbery and possession of an offensive weapon.

A 16-year-old from Carnforth admitted robbery.

The court heard how, on 20 November 2019, at around 8.50pm, three males wearing masks entered Foreways in Blackwell Road and demanded the women working there open the till. One was holding a meat cleaver and another a knife.

They grabbed cigarettes and put them into a duvet cover before grabbing the till drawer and taking the money.

One then grabbed bottles of wine from the shelves.

The three then fled the store.

All three were arrested the following day when officers searched an address in Oaklands Drive in Carlisle and found all three hiding in the loft.

The trio were interviewed but gave no comment responses to all questions.

However, they subsequently admitted the offences at court.

Blackburn was sentenced to 40 months in youth custody and the 17-year-old was sentenced to three years. The 16-year-old was sentenced to a 24 month detention training order.

Detective Constable Stephen Kidd said: "This was a terrifying experience for the women who worked in the shop who found themselves confronted by unknown people in masks armed with weapons.

"Any time people carry or brandish knives or other bladed weapons there is the potential for serious injuries to be caused. Thankfully, in this instance nobody was hurt.

"Today's sentencing should send out a strong message as to how seriously the police and the courts take such offending."
