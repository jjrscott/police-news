Chief Constable Michelle Skeer said: "It is with deep sadness that I learned of the tragic death of PC Oli Evans.

"All our thoughts at Cumbria Constabulary are with Oli's family and friends at this difficult time and our heartfelt condolences go out to them.

"Oli was a dedicated, professional officer who was well-liked by his colleagues.

"Any death within the police family hits us all hard but will have particular impact on those who knew and worked closely alongside Oli."
