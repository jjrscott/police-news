A man has been given a 16 month sentence which has been suspended for two years for a serious assault at Whitehaven bar.

Karl Olstrum, aged 29, of Ullswater Avenue, Whitehaven was sentenced today (March 5) at Carlisle Crown Court for inflicting grievous bodily harm without intents.

Olstrum pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing on the 13th January.

On 7th December 2019 at a bar on Duke Street, Whitehaven Oestrum's victim entered the bar just after 10pm.

Olstrum was stood at the bar at the time as the victim ordered drinks, a short while layer the victim headed to the male toilet and Olstrum followed.

Inside the bathroom Olstrum assaulted the victim multiple times knocking him to the ground causing the victim to lose consciousness momentarily. The assault left the victim with multiple fractures to the left side of his face and significant bruising around the eye.

Olstrum quickly left the bar following the assault.

 Detective Constable Alastair Clarke said, "This was an unprovoked attack in which Olstrum left his victim with multiple facial fractures.

"Although he isn't serving time in prison, I hope this outcome gives Olstrum and others a warning on the impact that these offences can have on not just the victim but on your own life.
