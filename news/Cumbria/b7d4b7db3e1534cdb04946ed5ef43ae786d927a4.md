Police are currently dealing with an incident involving a HGV which has shed its load on the A66 Eastbound near to Stainmore, causing a portacabin it was transporting to fall onto the road.

Police were called to the incident at around 2pm this afternoon (28th January).

Due to adverse weather conditions, we are unable to clear this obstruction, which means that the Eastbound carriageway may remain closed to HGVs until tomorrow morning (30th January).

The Westbound carriageway is temporarily closed to all vehicles while the HGV's travelling east are turned around. This will be reopened as soon as possible to all vehicles.

Motorists are asked to use alternative routes where possible.
