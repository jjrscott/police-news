Drugs

A man who was found in possession of 60 wraps of cocaine and eight wraps of heroin has today (28 June) been jailed for 32 months.

Matthew Rimmer, 28, of Ainslie Street, Ulverston, admitted charges of possession with intent to supply cocaine and money laundering and was sentenced today at Preston Crown Court.

The court heard how Rimmer was stopped by officers whilst driving a Honda Civic in Ferry Road in Barrow on the evening of 28 May 2019.

Officers were suspicious of Rimmer's demeanour and so carried out a search. Two phones were found along with a small amount of cannabis and £510 in crumpled notes.

Rimmer was arrested and subsequently found to be in possession of Class A drugs. The haul included 43 wraps of cocaine and eight wraps of heroin hidden in his underpants.

The street value of the drugs recovered was estimated at £1,360.

Officers who searched Rimmer's home found a rucksack containing an iPhone, a bong, two sets of digital scales and a quantity of snap locks.

A spokesman for South Cumbria's Area Drugs Unit said: "Rimmer is behind bars today thanks to some good police work, first by officers on the streets on Barrow who spotted something they suspected was not right and acted upon it and then by officers who searched the defendant's home, recovering further evidence of criminality.

"Specialist drugs detectives were able to pick up this investigation and, through diligent work alongside colleagues from the Crown Prosecution Service, the result is a significant term of imprisonment.

"Cumbria Constabulary takes the dealing Class A drugs extremely seriously and we would urge anyone who can help us bring more criminals to justice to get in touch on 101 or vis Crimestoppers anonymously."
