Detectives in west Cumbria have charged a man in connection with a violent incident in Egremont.

Jack Ward, 26, from Egremont, was charged last night (13 July) with using threatening and violent behaviour in a public place.

He is scheduled to appear at Workington Magistrates' Court on 10 August.

The charge follows an incident on Sunday night (12 July) where two men were involved in an altercation on Main Street.
