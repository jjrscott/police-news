Police have issued three venues in Cumbria with fines in recent days following breaches of coronavirus regulations.

Officers say most licensees are abiding by the rules to protect us all and help stop spread of the virus.

But action will be taken against those who contravene the Covid-19 restrictions.

The three venues given fines in recent days were:

* Barrow Raiders Rugby Football Club. This followed an incident on September 26.

It was found the club, holding a marquee public function, allowed people of different groups to mingle and allowed people to be up and dancing without maintaining appropriate distances.

* The Central in Egremont. This was checked after 10pm on Friday and found to have people within drinking.

* The Bush Inn at Cockermouth. This was also checked after 10pm on Friday and found to have people within drinking.

Assistant Chief Constable Andrew Slattery said: "I am very grateful for the way the majority of licensees have complied with the regulations in place to protect us all.

"But it is clear a small number of breaches have taken place - and we would urge everyone, both individuals and business owners and staff, to do their bit to stop the spread of the virus by sticking to the regulations.

"These fines show Cumbria Constabulary will take action against breaches of coronavirus restrictions and our officers will be out in our communities monitoring for any further breaches.

"We ask everyone to continue to act responsibly and take personal responsibility for protecting themselves, their families and communities - and if you are a business owner, your customers."

A number of other fines were issued during the recent weekend.

Included among these were 13 tickets issued to a group who had travelled from outside the county for a stag do in west Cumbria.
