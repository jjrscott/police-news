Child Centred Policing team

Cumbria Police's Child Centred Policing Team, spread Christmas cheer by donating presents to Cash for Kids.

The team made the decision to get involved in donating gifts to the charity appeal, after agreeing they want to make an extra difference during this festive season.

There are Child Centred Policing (CCP) teams in North, South and West Cumbria. They work closely with children, families, care givers and partner agencies (such as educational establishments); allowing early identification of children who need support and intervention with a view to improving their lives and diverting them away from the criminal justice system.

Inspector Gemma Hannah, Child Centred Policing Lead, said:

"Our Child Centred policing teams are passionate about supporting and engaging with children and their families.

"The work that we do means that we see first-hand how small acts of kindness and positive interventions can make a huge impact on people's lives; from listening to someone's worries, to saying 'well done'\- it doesn't have to be a big gesture.

"This Christmas, we wanted to help make a difference to those children whose Christmas might not involve the joy of receiving a gift, to let them and their families and carers know that we wish them a Merry Christmas.

"That is why we wanted to be involved in the Cash for Kids, Christmas appeal.

"Cash for Kids is a fantastic charity, providing amazing support and initiatives to those who need it.

"We hope the gifts we have donated put a smile on the faces of those who receive them."
