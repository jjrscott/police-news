Police are concerned for the welfare of 13-year-old Chloe Weaver from Milnthorpe, who was last seen at the Vue cinema in Lancaster on Tuesday afternoon (18th February).

Chloe is described as white, 5ft5inches tall, of slim build and with shoulder length dark brown hair.

She is believed to be wearing light coloured denim jeans, a gold jacket with fur on the front and white Nike trainers.

Chloe is known to have contacts in the West Cumbria area.

Anyone who sees Chloe or anyone with information is asked to call police on 101. We would also like to urge Chloe to call us if she sees this appeal.
