Phil Longcake

The man who died in the incident at Dixon's Chimney on Monday 28th October has been formally identified as Robert Philip Longcake, 53, known as Phil to his family and friends.

Family tribute to Phil Longcake:

_

Phil was a strong, brave man who achieved a lot in his short life. Sadly, due to recent disclosures he made about historic trauma he suffered, Phil was battling with his mental health, with the love and support of his family and health professionals whilst trying to overcome this.

He was a keen motorcyclist and would often spend weekends away with his son, Robert. He loved fell walking with his dog Ted and was a passionate musician who played the guitar, piano and accordion. He also loved to sing, and did his own covers of popular music.

Phil was a fantastic granddad to his three grandchildren, James, George and William. They adored him.

Phil had many wonderful and happy times with his family, and these memories will be treasured by his loved ones.

Phil will be very much missed by his wife Andrea, his two children Robert and Laura and their partners Sarah and Darren, grandchildren James, George and William, dad Bill and brother John, and all his friends and those that knew him._
