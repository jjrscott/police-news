Christopher Turnbull-Allen

A Cumbria man has been jailed today for two years after he admitted a charge of possession of Mephedrone with intent to supply.

Christopher Turnbull-Allen, 33, of Westgarth Court, Kirkby Stephen was sentenced today at York Crown Court.

The court hear how Turnbull-Allen was driving on the A1 on 18 October 2019 when he was stopped by an officer from North Yorkshire Police.

The officer used his sniffer dog to search the car and a wrap and a snap bag were found which the officer suspected contained drugs.

A further search recovered a supermarket freezer bag under the passenger seat containing a large amount of white powder.

Also seized were digital scales and an iPhone.

The investigation was transferred to Cumbria Police and tests on the white powder showed the substance to be Mephedrone - commonly referred to as MCAT.

The drugs seized had a potential street value of more than Â£5,000.

In his police interview, Turnbull-Allen gave no comment responses to all questions.

However he admitted the charge at court.

A spokesman for the North Cumbria Area Drugs Squad, said: "We worked closely with our colleagues at North Yorkshire Police who made the initial arrest and the result of that is a North Cumbria drug dealer being jailed today for two years.

"The Constabulary takes such offending extremely seriously and will seek to bring anyone involved in the supply of drugs before the courts.

"The Dugs Squad welcomes any information from the community regarding drug supply - no matter how irrelevant they think it might be."
