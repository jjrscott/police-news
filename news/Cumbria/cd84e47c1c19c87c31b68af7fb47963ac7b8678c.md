Officers investigating the death of a 48-year-old man at an address in Barrow on Friday night (12 June) are continuing to appeal for witnesses to come forward.

Police were called to Broad Close in Barrow on Friday evening (12th June) following a report that a man had been stabbed. The man subsequently died and a 63-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.

The suspect remains in police custody for questioning following an extension to his detention granted by magistrates.

Detective Chief Inspector Furzana Nazir said: "Following my previous witness appeal and investigative enquiries by detectives, I can confirm that a number of witnesses have come forward.

"If you were in the area of Broad Close on Friday 12th June between 7pm and 8.30pm and detectives have not spoken to you, I would like you to make contact with the police.

"Investigations are ongoing and it is vitally important for anyone with information or any witnesses to come forward to help us with our enquiries.

"The family of the victim are currently being supported by a family liaison officer and we ask that they are given privacy to come to terms with the sudden and unexpected death of their loved one."

Anyone with information is urged to call 101 quoting log 198 of 12th June. Alternatively you can attend Barrow Police Station or call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
