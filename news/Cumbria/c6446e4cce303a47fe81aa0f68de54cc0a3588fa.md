Police are appealing for information over a collection of property which may be stolen.

The property, including a large amount of boxed Hilti power tools, a chainsaw, two bicycles and an outboard motor, were found by officers inside a van on the A591 at Bannerrigg at 5.45am today (August 28).

Officers suspect these items may have been stolen.

They are urging anybody to come forward who suspects they may have had property stolen overnight in the south Lakes area.

Three men, aged 18, 28 and 23, have been arrested as part of the inquiry. They remain in custody today.

If you think you may have had property stolen overnight, contact officers on 101, referring to log 18 of August 28.
