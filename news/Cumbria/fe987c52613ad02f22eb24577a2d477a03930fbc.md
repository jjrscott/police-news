Sean McDonald

A man who embarked on a crime spree targeting businesses in Penrith and Kendal was jailed yesterday (1st August 2019) at Carlisle Crown Court for 5 years.

Sean Owen McDonald, 49, of Clapham Green, Middlesbrough, was charged with numerous offences committed throughout Cumbria in 2016.

He was wanted nationally since 2017 and was arrested in Cleveland, Teeside in September 2018.

Over a two week period McDonald stole plant, tools, a truck, and attempted to steal other property from Thompsons of Penrith, Jimmy Allen Plant Hire Penrith and Cox and Allen Ltd of Kendal. .

The various businesses targeted by McDonald lost a substantial amount of money on plant machinery, loss of earnings and disruption to their daily business.

Following a trial, McDonald was convicted of 3 counts of theft, two counts of going equipped for theft, and attempted theft and found not guilty for 3 other offences.

Detective Chief Inspector Helen Harkins said "These crimes have had a huge impact on a business financially and a wider effect on the owners, workers, and customers, who use these local businesses on a daily basis.

"The conviction and sentencing of McDonald reflects the seriousness of the crimes and that Cumbria Constabulary will leave no stone unturned to bring offenders to justice however long it takes"
