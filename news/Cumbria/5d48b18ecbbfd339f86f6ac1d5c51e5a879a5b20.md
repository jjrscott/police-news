Pelham

Kyle Pelham, 23, of Raiselands Croft, Penrith has today (Oct 22) been sentenced to 22 months at Carlisle Crown Court as well as a restraining order preventing him from contacting his victim.

He was sentenced in relation to the following offences against his ex-partner;

 * Coercive and Controlling Behaviour
 * Three counts of assault

Detective Constable, James Bowness, who lead the investigation, said:

"I am pleased with the sentence given today. Pelham subjected his victim to three separate assaults as part of his controlling behaviour.

"Even during interview Pelham tried to control the interview, claiming the victim was making up the allegation and claiming the injustice to himself.

"As a force we are committed to providing victims of crime with the support they need, and I would encourage anyone who finds themselves the victim of crime to come forward and report it. I can assure victims of domestic violence and controlling behaviour that they will be treated courteously and compassionately by specially trained officers."

Anyone who would like to report domestic abuse can call Cumbria Police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
