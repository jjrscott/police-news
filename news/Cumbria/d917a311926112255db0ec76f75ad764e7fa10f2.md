Officers on patrol in the Appleby area as part of their Appleby Horse Fair deployment came across a man collapsed in the road yesterday evening (6 June).

The officers were in an ARV (Armed Response Vehicle) which was equipped with advanced CPR equipment when they came across the man in Dufton at around 7.40pm.

The officers administered CPR until an air ambulance arrived and took over the life-saving efforts before transporting the man to Cumberland Infirmary Carlisle.

The man, aged 55 and from Scotland, had suffered a suspected medical episode. He is currently in a critical but stable condition in hospital.

Temp Ch Supt Rob O'Connor, Gold Commander for Appleby Horse Fair, said: "I would like to thank those officers who came across the casualty for their swift actions and their proficient use of the advanced CPR equipment on board their vehicles.

"By acting so quickly and proficiently they were able to give this man the best chance of survival before handing him over into the care of the medical professionals.

"Examples like this of police and paramedic first responders working together can often go under the radar but can result in lives being saved, and I hope this gentleman makes a full recovery."
