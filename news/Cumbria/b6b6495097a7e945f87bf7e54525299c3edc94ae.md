Gavin Helps

The family of a 17-year-old who died following a road traffic collision near Rockcliffe yesterday have paid tribute to his life.

Police were called to the one vehicle collision near to the railway bridge at Rockcliffe, at approximately 5.10pm. Gavin Anthony Helps, of Carlisle, died at the scene.

Gavin's family said,

"Gavin was a beloved son to Claire and loving brother to Laura and Matthew. He was taken from us too soon, in tragic circumstances. We will miss you."

Mr Helps was a passenger in a red VW Polo.

The driver, a 17-year-old male from Carlisle, and two other passengers were taken to the Cumberland Infirmary. The driver is assisting police with their enquiries.

Officers would like to speak to any witnesses to the collision and in particular, they would like to speak anyone who has dashcam footage of the vehicle in the area of North Carlisle & Kingstown at the time just prior to the collision.

Those with information are asked to contact police on 101 and ask to speak to Sgt 2240 Radzan, quoting incident number 175 of September 22.
