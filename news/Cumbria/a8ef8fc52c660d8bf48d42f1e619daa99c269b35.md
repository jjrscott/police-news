Police are investigating a report by NWAS into a suspected burglary that occurred at Ulverston Ambulance Station, Victoria Road. The incident was reported to have occurred between 11:30pm on 17th January and the early hours of 18th January.

During the incident medication was stolen. These were: 2910mg/1ml ampoules of morphine sulphate, which should be in three boxes - and a drugs pouch containing 8 Diazemuls (10mg/2mul ampoules) and 5 Diazepam (5mg/2.5ml tubes).

Officers would like to warn people that the medication is for emergency use by paramedics only. If possessed, taken or sold in any other circumstances, people will potentially commit offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act. There is also a significant risk of harm if you were to use those medicines on yourself.

Anyone with information is encouraged to contact police on 101, quoting incident number 99 of 18 January. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
