Police are appealing for witnesses after a man was arrested this afternoon (17 Aug) on suspicion of common assault and possession of a bladed article.

The arrest followed a call at 2.30pm from a member of the public who was sat in a car in the vicinity of The Bridge Hotel, Buttermere when a woman in her 20s got into the car and asked for help. The woman was then pulled from the car by a man who drove away with her in his own vehicle - a blue Citroen panel van.

The woman, who is from the Bournemouth area, was subsequently located safe and well and a 34-year-old man from Wiltshire was arrested at around 3pm in Lorton.

Officers are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed any part of this incident - whether in the vicinity of The Bridge Hotel, in Lorton or at any point in between.

Please contact Cumbria Police referencing incident 137 of today (17 Aug).
