Two men and a teenager were arrested in Appleby on Sunday evening and subsequently charged with offences following an incident in Cherry Row in Appleby.

Officers were called at around 8.30pm on Sunday (26 May) following a report of a racially aggravated public order having taken place where a member of the public had been verbally abused.

Officers attended and arrested two men in their 20s and a boy aged 16. They have all subsequently been charged with offences:

- Alexander Kennedy, 20, of Alderston Avenue, Ayr, has been charged with two public order offences

- John Stewart, 21, of Thack Lane, Penrith, has been charged with three public order offences

- A 16-year-old from the Darlington area has been charged with two public order offences

All three have been bailed to appear at Carlisle Magistrates' Court on 25 June 2019. They each have bail conditions preventing them from going to Appleby prior to their court date.
