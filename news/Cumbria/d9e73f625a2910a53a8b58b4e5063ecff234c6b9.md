Emergency services are continuing to respond to an incident at Dixons chimney in Carlisle where a man is trapped at height.

Cumbria Fire and Rescue and Cumbria Constabulary are at the scene.

The man was reported to have become stuck just after 2:20am this morning (28 Oct).

John McVay, Cumbria Fire and rescue, Area Manager said,

"This is a very complex and difficult process given the obvious dangers to the man and the extreme difficulty in gaining access to him in a way which will keep him and emergency services safe.

"I can assure the public that the emergency services are working tirelessly and effectively together to resolve this issues safely for all and that the protection of life is our first priority.

"I ask people impacted by the incident and the road closures to continue to show patience."

"I'd also like to ask anyone who has a cherry picker in excess of 90 metres within Cumbria to please contact Cumbria police or Cumbria Fire and rescue service on 999"

The road is currently closed at Stanhope Road, Charlotte Street and Shaddongate where it meets Bridge Street (A595)

The public are asked to avoid the area.
