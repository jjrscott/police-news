**Superintendent Matt Kennerley said:**

"As we head into the Easter holiday period and as the weather gets nicer we are appealing to parents to speak with their children about what they are doing and the moral responsibility we all have in response to the coronavirus outbreak.

"This is not a time for anyone including young people to congregate in large groups and certainly is no excuse to behave in an antisocial manner or commit criminal offences.

"All our communities need to work together and listen to the advice and stay home, to help save lives and not cause further misery to other members of the community by behaving antisocially during an already difficult time."
