Detectives investigating two recent quad bike thefts in the Levens and Lyth valley area are appealing for witnesses that may have seen two vehicles in the area on the 20th November between 6pm and 7:30pm.

It is reported that two vehicles were sighted in the area at the time described as a white van and a Mitsubishi Shogun.

The quad bikes taken are still outstanding and are a Green Honda and a Red Yamaha Grizly.

A 52-year-old man from Burnley was arrested on suspicion of burglary and released under further investigation.

**Detective Constable Andrew Wright said,**

"I urge anyone who was in the area at the time to get in touch with police, especially those who were in the area looking for the vehicles at the time.

"Officers will continue to patrol across the area to provide reassurance to victims and communities. However, to assist us in our efforts to apprehend these criminals, please report any suspicious activity or vehicles to the police."

If you were in the area and witnessed any suspicious activity at that time, please get in touch with DC 2430 Wright on 101 email 101@cumbria.police.uk, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, quoting log 183 of the 20th November 2019.
