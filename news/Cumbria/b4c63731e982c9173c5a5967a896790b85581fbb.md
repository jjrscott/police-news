Police can confirm that two suspects were arrested on suspicion of attempted armed robbery following an incident yesterday (9th January) inside the Risino Bros shop on Jane Street.

An unknown offender entered the shop and threatened a staff member with a wood axe.

A 41-year-old man from Workington and a 44-year-old man also from Workington have since been released under investigation.

Enquiries are ongoing and police are appealing for anyone who may have dashcam footage showing the area of Jane Street/Oxford Street at around 12.15-12.30pm yesterday, to get in touch with us on 101.

We would like to reassure the public that this is an isolated incident and there is no threat to members of the public. Investigations are ongoing.

Anyone with information is again asked to contact police on 101, quoting log 86 of the 9th January.
