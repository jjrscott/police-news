We are aware of a social media post proposing a gathering in Vulcan Park, Workington, this weekend in connection with the current Covid-19 restrictions.

Suitable advice is being given in line with our policing style to keep people safe, in which we engage, explain and encourage people to follow the national guidance, with enforcement used only if these three pillars are unsuccessful.

It is important to remember why we are following the restrictions - this sacrifice is to ensure that we protect the NHS and save lives.

We would take this opportunity to again emphasise what the public needs to do to keep our communities safe:

* Only go outside for food, health reasons or work (but only if you cannot work from home)

* If you go out, stay two metres (6ft) away from other people at all times

* Wash your hands as soon as you get home

Do not meet others, even friends or family. You can spread the virus even if you don't have symptoms.
