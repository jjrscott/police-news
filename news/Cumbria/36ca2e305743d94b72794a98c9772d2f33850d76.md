Police are appealing for information following an assault in Workington in the early hours of today.

Officers were called to a house in Coniston Drive, Workington, just before 1am following a report of a serious assault by a man using bladed articles on two people.

A man and woman - aged 37 and 35 - suffered serious but none life threatening injuries. They were taken to the Cumberland Infirmary.

Officers are appealing for anyone with information about the incident, or anyone who witnessed this incident to either approach an officer at the scene, or call 101 quoting incident number 2 of the 21st of August.

No arrests have yet been made but we are developing strong lines of enquiry as part of the investigation being conducted by West Cumbria CID.

There will be a heightened police presence in the area.
