Taylor Thompson

18-year-old Taylor Thompson was sentenced today (9 October) at Carlisle Crown Court after admitting being concerned in the supply of heroin and crack cocaine and possessing criminal property.

Thompson was sentenced to 24 months in prison following his arrest on the 29th May 2020, when officers spotted Thompson dealing drugs outside his home in the Highgate area of Kendal.

When arrested, Thompson was found with wraps of cocaine, heroin and around Â£2,000 of cash on him.

A mobile phone in the house was also found to contain images of drugs and money and text messages discussing dealing drugs. A knife, pick axe handle and two hammers were also seized by officers.

PC Chris Appleyard said:

"Thompson is the latest example of the potential consequences that those involved in the supply of drugs can expect to receive.

"The dealing of Class A drugs has an impact on local communities and destroys lives. We want to hear from anyone with information about drug dealing or drug use in Cumbria.

"You can contact Cumbria Police direct or Crimestoppers anonymously."

To report any information about drug use please contact police on 101, or contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. Always 999 dial in an emergency.
