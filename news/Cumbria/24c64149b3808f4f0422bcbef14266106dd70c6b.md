Detectives in Carlisle are warning drug users to rethink their actions following recent reports of adverse effects of Cocaine and Xanax that may be circulating in the area.

Detective Inspector Ian Harwood said: "We urge those who are considering taking substances particularly Cocaine and Xanax to really think about the effects of what they are doing. Taking drugs can prove to be fatal and ruins lives."

"We continue to work closely with our partner agencies to try and stamp out drug use in Cumbria but we also need the public's help in reporting any information they have about drug use or drug dealing in their area to us.

 "There is support out there for people affected by drugs. Unity, a drug and alcohol recovery service, who is one of our partners can be contacted on the details listed below."

Anyone with information about drugs supply is asked to call police on 101, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
