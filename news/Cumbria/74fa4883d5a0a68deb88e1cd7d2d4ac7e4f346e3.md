Detectives in West Cumbria are currently investigating a burglary where large quantities of prescription only drugs were stolen.

Large amounts of; Pregabalin, Rosuvastatin, Zopiclone, Bendroflumethiazide, Bisoprolol, Losartan and Orlistat were stolen from an address in the Findlay Place area of Workington early yesterday evening (June 20).

DC James Graham said: "These drugs are only normally administered following clinical advice. Anyone taking them is putting their health at serious risk. If taken these drugs could lead to serious injury or death.

"Anyone who thinks they've taken any of these drugs should go straight to A&E and take the packaging with them."

A 36-year-old man and a 33-year-old woman have been arrested on suspicion of burglary and remain in custody at this time.

Anyone who witnessed anything suspicious between 6pm and 11pm yesterday (June 20) in the Findlay Place area of Workington is urged to contact Detectives with information via 101 quoting reference 73 of the 21st June 2020 or alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
