Police were called at around 12pm today (August 21) to the report of a cow loose in the Kingstown area.

The cow, which was in a highly distressed state, was destroyed by armed officers following concerns for the public and motorists.

Efforts were made to resolve the situation safely, however given the potential danger and the increased stress on the animal a decision was taken to conclude the incident as quickly and humanely as possible.
