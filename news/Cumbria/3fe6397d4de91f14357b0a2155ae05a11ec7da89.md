**Public Health Advice - Fire **

Tune in to the local radio station for advice and information.

Motorists who have to travel through the smoke should keep windows closed, turn off air conditioning and keep their air vents closed.

The majority of people are unlikely to experience any health effects following exposure to smoke from a fire, however because any smoke is an irritant, it can make people's eyes and throat sore.

People with asthma or other respiratory conditions, and older people, may be particularly susceptible to the smoke and should carry and use their medication (such as inhalers) as usual. They should avoid strenuous physical activity and follow their doctor's usual advice about exercising and managing their condition.
