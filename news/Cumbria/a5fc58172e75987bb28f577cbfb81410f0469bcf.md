A Whitehaven pub has been issued with a Â£1,000 fine for a breach of Coronavirus regulations.

Police issued the penalty at The Packhorse in Lowther Street on Tuesday after it failed to close at 10pm.

This followed a number of checks on pubs and venues across Copeland.

Inspector Richard Smillie said: "The majority of pubs have complied and continue to comply with the regulations there to help us all.

"We must not be complacent. The virus is spreading throughout the county and the rules are in place to protect ourselves, our families and our communities.

"This fine once again shows Cumbria Constabulary will take action against breaches of Coronavirus restrictions.

"Our officers will be out in our communities monitoring for any further breaches."
Louise Coid, Manager of the Copeland Local Focus Hub, said: "Copeland Council is working collaboratively with the police to help ensure the safety of our community.

"We are also working with our pubs and businesses to help them comply with the regulations.

"The vast majority in Copeland are following the regulations, but we have a proactive approach to investigating suspected breaches and enforcing where appropriate."
