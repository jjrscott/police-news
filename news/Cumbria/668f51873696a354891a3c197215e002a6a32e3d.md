Terry Abson

The family of a man who died following a road traffic collision on Monday 1st March on West Tower Street, Carlisle have paid tribute to his life.

Terence Abson known as Terry, aged 62, of Lingside Crescent, Carlisle, was sadly pronounced dead.

The collision involved two pedestrians and a white panel van.

The second pedestrian, a 56-year-old woman from Carlisle was airlifted to Preston hospital. Her condition is described as serious but stable.

**His family released the following statement which paid tribute to his life:**

"Terry was a caring partner to Gina and a great dad to Harley.

"He was kind and jolly, exceedingly friendly to all, with a lovely big smile that could light up any room. He was generous with his time and resources, always willing to help family and friends with odd jobs and helped out at the Uma Kadampa Centre.

"He was sometimes mischievous in nature, teasing and joking, and he made friends in a heartbeat.

"Terry was always willing to listen and offer up whatever advice he could, be it from personal experience from his many years in the Navy and other employment, to just plain common sense.

"He kept himself active with squash and "adventure walks" with his beloved dog, and he never let anything hold him down. Above all, he always made sure his partner and son were happy and cared for. His kindness, lightness, and generosity, will always be remembered."
