Stewart McIntosh

A Longtown man who committed fraud and theft offences against a business to the value of £100,000 in which he worked for has today (Jan 17) been sentenced.

Stewart McIntosh, 58, of English Street, Longtown has today been sentenced to 2 year 8 months at Carlisle Crown Court. He pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing at Carlisle Magistrates on the 17th December 2019.

McIntosh between June 2010 and June 2018 falsified daily cash management sheets used by his employer to take cash from the company up to the sum of £100,588.

McIntosh stole a further £6,650 from the business between January 2018 and May 2018 through falsifying banking records and failing to bank money on 12 occasions.

**Detective Constable Andrew Metcalf said:**

"This is a positive result for the owners of the premises, Mr McIntosh showed no remorse for his actions during the investigation.

This result today provides the owners an opportunity to move forward with their lives, both personally and professionally. I am happy that Mr McIntosh has been held to account for his actions"
