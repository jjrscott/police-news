Beswick

A man from Liverpool who was found in possession of heroin and cash in Barrow has today been jailed for 28 months.

Stephen Beswick, 49, of Finch Lane, Knotty Ash, Liverpool appeared at Preston Crown Court today (3 Jan) and was sentenced after he admitted possession of controlled drugs with intent to supply and possession of criminal property (money laundering).

Police attended an address in Ramsden Street in Barrow on 27 March 2019 following information that criminality may be taking place there.

Inside, officers found Beswick in possession of a green rucksack containing 180 street deals of brown powder which was tested and found to be heroin with a street value of more than £3,600.

Beswick was also in possession of more than £2,300 in cash.

Beswick was arrested and gave a statement to police denying that he was involved in drugs supply, claiming the drugs were nothing to do with him.

However, at court Beswick admitted the offences.

The drugs were forfeited and destroyed.

A spokesman for South Cumbria CID said: "Beswick is the latest person from outside the county to learn that Cumbria is now soft touch for drugs supply.

"We will take action against those who seek to profit from the illegal supply of drugs and we continue to encourage the public to report any suspicions they have regarding the supply of drugs."
