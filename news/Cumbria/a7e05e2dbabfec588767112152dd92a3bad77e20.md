A survey is now open for the public to express their views on policing in Cumbria.

The results of the survey, which is a joint initiative between the Constabulary and the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner (OPCC), will help inform how policing is conducted in the future.

The survey, which should take only ten minutes to complete, provides you the opportunity to feedback on the following areas:

* How safe you feel?

* Your views on local policing?

* How confident you are in Cumbria Constabulary?

* Whether antisocial driving takes place in your neighbourhood?

* How you'd like to engage with Cumbria Constabulary and the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner?

* What you know about the Police and Crime Commissioner?

The survey will run until 31st October and you can access it by visiting www.cumbria.police.uk/About-Us/Public-Consultation-Survey-2019.aspx.

Chief Constable Michelle Skeer said:

"We are privileged to serve in an area which is one of the safest places in the country to live, work and visit. This is achieved by the effective and dedicated work carried out by officers and staff throughout the year.

"It is essential that we do not become complacent and therefore we want to hear from you, our communities, on your thoughts about how we police and how that makes you feel. Your responses will help us shape how policing in Cumbria will look over the next few years and beyond.

"I'd encourage anyone to set aside the short amount of time it takes to complete this survey and help us keep people safe in our county."

Cumbria's Police and Crime Commissioner, Peter McCall, said:

"As Police and Crime Commissioner, my main role is to the voice of the public and take any concerns to the Chief Constable.

"The police rely on the public to report and identify any issues going on in their area and often pick up on problems such as dangerous driving, anti-social behaviour and drug dealers.

"This survey is a chance for anyone to share their views and opinions on policing in Cumbria and will help shape the priorities of the police going forward.

"I would urge everyone to take the time to fill out the survey and help us identify what is most important to you."
