Four men have been released on police bail following investigations launched after police were called to Hollywood Retail Park at Barrow on Thursday night (June 4).

Officers were called to Hollywood Retail Park shortly after 8.30pm on Thursday.

There were a number of people in the area at the time and officers remain keen to hear from anyone who witnessed anything. Call police on 101 quoting log 184 of the 4th June 2020.

Cumbria Police remains vigilant and firm in its resolve that hate crime is unacceptable and will always be dealt with robustly.
