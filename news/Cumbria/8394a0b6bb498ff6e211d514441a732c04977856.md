Cumbria Police are urging drivers to take extra care in the current weather - and only drive if necessary.

Officers are asking motorists who do take to the road to drive to the conditions, with a rain warning currently in place for a large part of the county.

They should also keep up to date with travel news and check for any disruptions on their journeys.

A Met Office yellow warning for rain has been issued for the northern half of Cumbria.

It is valid from now until midnight tonight.

It means spray and flooding could lead to difficult driving conditions and some road closures.

Bus and train services could be affected, with journey times taking longer.

Superintendent Justin Bibby said: "We would ask people to consider the bad weather and only drive if necessary.

"If people do have to make journeys we would ask them to be vigilant as to the road conditions and take care.

"We would ask drivers to leave themselves plenty of time for any journeys and to monitor local radio and websites for any travel information.

"If anybody does need to drive, please be aware of your surroundings, drive to the conditions you face and take care."

Before starting your journey, please check your route.
