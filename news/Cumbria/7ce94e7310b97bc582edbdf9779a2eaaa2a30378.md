Police would like to reassure residents of Maryport following the deployment of armed officers to the town at 4.27pm this afternoon (2 May).

Police received numerous reports from the public that cows had escaped from a nearby field and were causing a risk to the public due to the animals being in a distressed state.

The A594 near to the Gillbeck park area of Maryport was closed for a short period while the cows were safely taken back to the field.

Armed officers were deployed to the scene as a standard public safety response to this type of incident.
