The parent of 17-year-old boy has been reported for disregarding the government's new measures by allowing her son to leave his home without a reasonable explanation.

Police attended a report of stones being thrown and vehicles being damaged at around 2am yesterday morning (April 2) in the area of Sheepmount, Carlisle. Officers attended and located a boy aged 17, and from the local area.

Officers spoke with the boy but he refused to inform officers of a reasonable explanation or provide his details.

He had previously been spoken to multiple times by officers about walking the streets without reasonable explanation.

The boy was arrested for resisting arrest, police obstruction and previously reported burglary and releasedunder investigation.

Temporary Chief Superintendent Rob O'Connor said: "Officers are continuing to make every effort to engage with the public in these unprecedented times.

"The majority of our communities are abiding by the rules in order to help us all protect the NHS and the most vulnerable people in society.

"The last thing we want to do is to fine anyone, and unfortunately in this case we had to take steps to get the message across.

"We urge the public to continue to listen to the guidance given to you, stay at home and we will get through this together."
