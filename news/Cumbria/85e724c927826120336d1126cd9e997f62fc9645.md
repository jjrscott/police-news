Cumbria Police are asking residents of Ulverston and the surrounding areas to be vigilant following a spate of break-in burglaries this morning (6 February).

Around ten properties and vehicles have been subject to burglaries, which are all believed to be linked.

PC Mallinson of the South Lakes policing team said: I would like to appeal to the residents of Ulverston to check any CCTV or dashcam footage that they may have from the Bigland Drive/Rusland Crescent area. Investigations are ongoing and local policing teams will be paying extra attention to the areas affected.

Anyone who has seen or who sees suspicious activity, is asked to contact police on 101. Always call 999 in an emergency.
