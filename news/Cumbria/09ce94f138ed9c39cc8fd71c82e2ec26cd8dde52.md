Kyaran Weston

Police are asking people if they may have seen a missing Carlisle teenager.

Kyaran Weston, 17, was last seen at 5.30pm on March 15 in the Yew Tree Court area. He is believed to be in the Workington, primarily Moorclose and Mossbay, area.

Kyaran is described as a white male, 6ft 2ins tall, of slim build with short light brown hair.

Kyaran was last seen wearing a grey puffer jacket, black Under Armour tracksuit bottoms, black Nike trainers and a black Under Armour baseball cap.

Officers are appealing for anyone who may have seen Kyaran to contact Cumbria Police on 101.

Police would also ask Kyaran to contact this same number if he sees this appeal.
