_On Tuesday 13 October at around 9pm, police will be providing assistance to Highways England to close sections of the A590 between Brettargh Holt Roundabout and Junction 36 of the M6 motorway._

_The closures will be in place for a couple of hours and will enable the removal and replacement of roadworks to facilitate the movement of an essential abnormal load._

_During the closure there will be no access on to or over Brettargh Holt roundabout from any direction. The northbound exit slip road and the roundabout at junction 36 will also be closed during this time._

_Advance messages will be displayed over the weekend on roadside VMS boards and updates placed on the Cumbria Police and Cumbria Roads Policing twitter accounts (@CumbriaRoadsPol) on the night._
