The following is an open letter to the people of Cumbria from the below signatories:

_All authorities and partners in Cumbria are appealing to residents and visitors to adhere to the new lockdown guidance which are in place to protect the NHS and save lives._

_
_

_Whilst it may be tempting to go out for a scenic drive in the Lake District, now is the time to stay home, look after one another and play your part to make sure that Cumbria is ready for the return of visitors when it is safe to do so. _

_
_

_As part of the lockdown guidance, one of the few reasons you can legitimately leave your home is to exercise. If you are leaving your home for exercise **WE NEED YOU TO STAY LOCAL**. This also gives people the chance to stay local and shop local - supporting many of your local essential businesses that are still able to open._

_
_

_Infection rates in Cumbria are currently very high and by staying home and staying local for exercise we can all do our bit to help protect Cumbria 's residents and its communities._

_
_

_With such iconic wintery scenes across the Lake District National Park, it may be tempting to travel to a favourite beauty spot for your daily exercise - but we are asking you to help us all by following the national rules and commit to staying local. We 're fortunate in living in Cumbria in that we are surrounded by many outdoor spaces on our doorstep, so why not explore the beautiful parks and walks close by and while you're out support your local shop by shopping local. _

_
_

_With lockdown back upon us we are so sorry we can 't welcome you right now but we can't wait to see you back to enjoy COVID-safe experiences across the whole of Cumbria, including the Lake District, when restrictions are lifted. In the meantime, please do continue to plan ahead, book ahead and give yourself something wonderful to look forward to. If you were due to visit in the next few weeks, do get in touch with your provider to arrange a new date. visitlakedistrict.com_

_
_

_Everybody in Cumbria, both business and public sector, are now actively planning and preparing for the return of visitors when the time is right and doing everything possible to ensure that they will have a safe and enjoyable time when it is the right time to reopen for business. _

_
_

_But for now - if you have to leave home for essential reasons - please stay safe and stay local._
