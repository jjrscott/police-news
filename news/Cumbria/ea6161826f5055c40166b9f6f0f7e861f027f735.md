Officers investigating an incident at the River Kent in south Cumbria are appealing for information from the public.

Detectives are asking for witnesses or anyone who has dashcam footage taken in the area of Nannypie Lane between 9pm on Saturday 10th August and 7am on Sunday 11th August.

Officers were called at around 6:38am on the 11th August to the report of a concern for safety at the River Kent, Sedgwick.

At approximately 3pm on the 13th August a body of a 43-year-old man, from Ambleside, was found in the area of Levens Lane. The death remains unexplained at this time with inquiries ongoing.

Detective Inspector Charlotte Nutter said,

"We are also appealing to anyone that might have seen any vehicles in the layby opposite to the pig farm in the area of Nannypie Lane.

"I am also appealing for anyone who might have footage of the river on the 10th and 11th August to contact police on 101, email 101@cumbria.police.uk quoting log number 47 of the 11th August."
