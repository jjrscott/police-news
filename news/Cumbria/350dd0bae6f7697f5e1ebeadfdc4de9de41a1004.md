Ian Bell, aged 55, of Solway Street, Silloth, appeared at Carlisle Crown Court yesterday (Dec 1) and was handed a two-year restraining order against a woman.

Bell was discharged from court but given a restraining order without conviction.

A police spokesperson said "This is a great result for the victim. We look to secure a restraining order to help protect victims and prevent further offending.

"As a force we are committed to providing victims of crime with the support they need, and I would encourage anyone who finds themselves the victim of crime to come forward and report it. I can assure victims of stalking that they will be treated courteously and compassionately by specially trained officers."

Anyone who would like to report stalking or harassment can call Cumbria Police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
