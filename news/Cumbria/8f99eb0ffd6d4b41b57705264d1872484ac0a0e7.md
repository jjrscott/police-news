Officers investigating the death of a 48-year-old man at an address in Barrow on Friday night (12 June) are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

Detective Chief Inspector Furzana Nazir said: "I am appealing to anyone who was in the area of Broad Close on Friday 12th June between 7pm and 8.30pm to contact Police.

"Investigations are ongoing and it is vitally important for anyone with information or any witnesses to come forward to help us with our enquiries.

"The family of the victim are currently being supported by a family liaison officer and we ask that they are given privacy to come to terms with the sudden and unexpected death of their loved one."

Police were called to Broad Close in Barrow on Friday evening (12th June) following a report that a man had been stabbed. The man subsequently died and a 63-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder. He remains in police custody this morning.
