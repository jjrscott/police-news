Large crowds gathered at Whitehaven harbourside today, to watch demonstrations of the varied and exciting work of the emergency services.

The actions of search dogs and water rescuers were among the attractions at the public demonstration and free family fun day.

People were encouraged to come along to get an up-close insight into some of the crucial work that takes place to crack crime and keep people safe.

Advice was available and other attractions on show at the Emergency Services Day.

Inspector Richard Smillie, who is in charge of the Copeland Local Focus team, was among those overseeing the day.

He said: "The showcase event was a fantastic afternoon out.

"It was a great chance for us and the other agencies to meet the public and show them the work we do - and how these roles can also make great careers or volunteer positions.

"People seemed genuinely interested as they chatted about our work and the harbourside was a spectacular setting for such an event."

Among the other attractions were a life support and defibrillator demonstration, involving a community first responder and the North West Ambulance Service.
There was also a road collision rescue demonstration, involving Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service and the North West Ambulance Service.

A range of other emergency services teams were also on hand during the event.

These included various representatives from Cumbria Constabulary, including the Sellafield team, a dog handler, neighbourhood officers, as well as cadets and special constables.

Other emergency services represented on the day included the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, North West Ambulance Service, Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service, the Coastguard, the RNLI, Wasdale Mountain Rescue Team, Blood Bikes and the Blood Donation Service.
