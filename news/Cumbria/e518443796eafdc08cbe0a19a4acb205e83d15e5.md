Dylan Edney

Police are concerned for the welfare of 15-year-old Dylan Edney, who was last seen in the Kendal area on 24 February.

Dylan is described as 5ft 10in tall, of slim build, with short brown hair. He was last seen in a dark coloured t-shirt and North Face tracksuit bottoms.

Dylan has links to Barrow but could have travelled to any location.

Anyone with information on Dylan's whereabouts is urged to contact police on 101. Officers would also encourage Dylan to call this number if he sees this appeal.
