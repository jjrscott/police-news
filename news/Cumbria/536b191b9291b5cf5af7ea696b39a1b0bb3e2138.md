Joshua Thwaites

Officers in West Cumbria have taken action to stop a west Cumbrian man's antisocial and criminal behaviour.

A three-year Criminal Behaviour Order was secured on 6th November at Workington magistrates against Joshua Thwaites, 32, of Cross Street, Whitehaven. Thwaites has also been sentenced to 46 weeks.

The Criminal Behaviour Order prohibits Joshua from

 * Not to enter any property or premises that are members of the Workington Shopwatch Scheme at any time, and not to enter all other premises which display a Workington Shopwatch notice.
 * Not to enter the area of Workington as edged blue on the attached map
 * Not to enter any Tesco's stores in West Cumbria at any time
 * Not to enter McColl's, 81-85 Harrington Road, Workington at any time

**PC Leesa Edwards, Allerdale Local focus team, said: **

"This CBO was a great outcome as Thwaites is a prolific offender and I hope that the conditions will allow him to reflect on and change his behaviour.

"CBOs are a useful tool available to the courts which can help the offender to cease further criminality and help protect business owners.

"In this instance, the court agreed with our application for the order regarding a persistent offender who we continually have to deal with which takes away resources to those that genuinely require the help of officers.

"I would encourage anyone who witnesses the terms of such a court order being broken to contact the police immediately. The punishment for breaking the terms of a CBO can be up to five years in prison."

Anyone who witnesses Joshua Thwaites breaching the terms of his CBO should contact the police.
