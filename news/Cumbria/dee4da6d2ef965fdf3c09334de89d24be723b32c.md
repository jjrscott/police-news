Police are appealing for dashcam footage following an attempted robbery at a Workington convenience store.

Shortly after 4.45pm yesterday (July 29) a man entered the Costcutter store on Station Road and demanded money from staff. He made off from the store a short time later without taking anything.

Police are requesting for anyone with dashcam footage from the 29th, between 4pm and 5:30pm, from the area of Corporation Road, Senhouse Street, Station Road and the surrounding streets, to email police on 101@cumbria.police.uk where they will be sent a link to upload their dashcam footage too.

The suspect is described as being an adult male, wearing dark clothing and a mask. The male was carrying a large umbrella throughout the incident.

Inquiries are ongoing and officers are also appealing for anyone with any information regarding the incident, who has yet to speak to police, contact them.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 quoting incident number 162 of July 29. Alternatively information can be disclosed anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
