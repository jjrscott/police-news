Police are investigating a robbery that occurred at a Hensingham off-licence.

The incident occurred at Bewshers on Main Street shortly before 8pm yesterday (February 20).

A man, brandishing a knife, entered the store and demanded money from a staff member. The offender made off from the store a short time later with cash, cigarettes and alcohol. Nobody was injured during the incident.

Detectives are appealing for information in their efforts to trace the person responsible. The offender was described as carrying a large holdall and was wearing dark clothing.

Detective Constable Julie Robinson, West Cumbria Crime and Safeguarding Team, said:

"We would like the public's help in identifying the person responsible for this incident.

"This was an extremely distressing situation for the staff member involved. We would like to hear from anyone who may have seen a man, matching our description, in the area yesterday evening.

"Any information, no matter how insignificant a person may deem it, could assist our investigation."

Officers would also like to hear from anyone who was passing the area at the time of the incident who may have dashcam footage.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting incident number 192 of February 20. Alternatively information can be disclosed anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
