Police have issued a Â£1,000 fine to a pub in Barrow for breaching Coronavirus restrictions.

Officers gave the ticket at Chandlers in Ramsden Dock Road following the breach on October 9.

It was found the business failed to ensure customers were seated when ordering or consuming food or drink.

Superintendent Sarah Jackson said: "This is the latest fine to be issued to a bar or venue in Cumbria for a breach of restrictions.

"Most pubs are complying with the regulations and our thanks go out to those businesses for their efforts to prevent the spread of the virus.

"But this shows we will take action when it is necessary to do so."

Councillor Ann Thomson, the leader of Barrow Borough Council, said: "Coronavirus is a significant threat to the health of our residents and our teams are working alongside colleagues in the police to make sure businesses are operating safely across the borough.

"The majority are taking the restrictions very seriously and operating within the rules.

"Those who fail to comply, however, face a hefty fine. Everyone must do all they can to limit the spread of Covid-19 through our communities."
