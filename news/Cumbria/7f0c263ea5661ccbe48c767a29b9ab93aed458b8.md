Please assist in helping us protect people in Cumbria against Coronavirus scams by sharing this message from Action Fraud.

_Action Fraud is warning the public to remain vigilant as criminals begin to take advantage of the roll out of the COVID-19 vaccine to commit fraud.

As of 7 January 2021, Action Fraud, the national reporting centre for fraud and cyber crime, had received 57 reports in relation to the COVID-19 vaccine.

_**How to protect yourself:**_

_
_

_In the UK, coronavirus vaccines will only be available via the National Health Services of England, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. You can be contacted by the NHS, your employer, a GP surgery or pharmacy local to you, to receive your vaccine. Remember, the vaccine is free of charge. At no point will you be asked to pay._

_
_

_\- The NHS will never ask you for your bank account or card details._

_
_

_\- The NHS will never ask you for your PIN or banking password._

_
_

_\- The NHS will never arrive unannounced at your home to administer the vaccine._

_
_

_\- The NHS will never ask you to prove your identity by sending copies of personal documents such as your passport, driving licence, bills or pay slips. _

_
_

_If you receive a call you believe to be fraudulent, hang up. If you are suspicious about an email you have received, forward it to report@phishing.gov.uk

Suspicious text messages should be forwarded to the number 7726 which is free of charge._

_
_

_If you believe you are the victim of a fraud, please report this to Action Fraud as soon as possible by calling 0300 123 2040 or visiting www.actionfraud.police.uk

Please speak with relatives, particularly elderly and vulnerable relatives, to make sure they are aware and know how to protect themselves.
