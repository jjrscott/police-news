Scott Waring, 35, of Lowther Street, Carlisle, spat at three officers who were called out on Thursday evening (26th March) following reports that he was causing criminal damage at a hostel in Carlisle City Centre.

He was arrested and subsequently charged with criminal damage and three counts of assault on an emergency worker.

He has since been recalled to prison and will appear at Carlisle Magistrates Court on the 5th May.
