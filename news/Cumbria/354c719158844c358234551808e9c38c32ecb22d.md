Police are aware of the possibility that a strong batch of heroin may be circulating in Barrow - and are urging users of drugs to think carefully about their actions.
Officers are taking this opportunity to re-emphasise to drug users the potentially tragic consequences of their actions.
A police spokesman said: "There is help and support out there for people affected by drug use.
"We work closely with partner agencies such as Unity, who can provide people with help, support and guidance."
You can contact Unity on: 01229 207020.
