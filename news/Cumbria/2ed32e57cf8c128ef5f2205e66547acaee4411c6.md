John Lowe

A Carlisle man has today (Dec 1) been sentenced to 20 months for attempted burglary.

John Lowe, aged 43 of John Street, Carlisle pleaded guilty to attempted burglary and was sentenced to 20 months and given a Â£156 surcharge.

On the morning of the 17th July the victim found that his front gate had been tampered with on his property.

The victim reviewed their doorbell camera footage and found a man trying the front door and looking through the windows of the property at around 2:45am in an attempt to access the property.

Officers reviewed the footage and identified the male in the footage was Lowe.

Detective Constable Chris Burton said: "This result shows the importance of home security systems to help catch opportunist criminals.

"Rightly the homeowner had secured their property meaning Lowe wasn't able to access the property.

"I would like to take this opportunity to remind people to ensure that they are vigilant in their security processes. Being a victim of such offences is a traumatic and upsetting event that leaves many victims struggling to feel safe in their own home, which no-one should tolerate.

"You can help avoid this type of crime from happening to you by putting into practice the crime prevention advice that we issue on a regular basis."
