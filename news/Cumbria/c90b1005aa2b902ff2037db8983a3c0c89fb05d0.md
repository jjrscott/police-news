Simon Pipes

A man who had drugs with a potential street value of more than £100,000 stashed at his home has been jailed for six years.

Police today (June 10) said the sentence should send a stark message to other people involved in drugs crime after Simon Pipes, 29, was sentenced at Carlisle Crown Court.

On January 9, officers executed a search warrants at Pipes' home in School Road, Cumwhinton and at a compound he rented in Willowholme Industrial Estate, Carlisle

At his home address they seized batches of white powder, cash, a bb gun and knuckle dusters. Tests on one of the batches of white powder revealed it to be cocaine. The total street value was estimated to be over £100,000.

At a separate Carlisle lock-up used by Pipes, officers found a further £60,000 cash and more white powder.

Pipes admitted possession with intent to supply cocaine and possession of criminal property.

Detective Inspector Vicki Coombes said: "The sentence handed down today should send a clear message to those who think they can flood our communities with illegal drugs.

"We work closely with our local communities and partner agencies to target and dismantle drug supply operations.

"Pipes has rightly been brought to justice for his crimes. We will continue to target such criminals in order to minimise the knock-on effect that drug supply has on our communities.

"Members of the public can help us by reporting any suspicious activity to our officers."

Anyone with information on the supply of illegal drugs is asked to contact police on 101. Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
