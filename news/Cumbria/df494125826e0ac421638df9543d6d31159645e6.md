The Barrow Community Alcohol Partnership (CAP) is Co coordinated by Sergeant Andrew Travis from the Barrow local policing team and is a strategic group that meet and plan initiatives around underage drinking.

The partnership have been shortlisted for the Community Alcohol Partnerships Award for CAP+ of the year at the 2020 Community Alcohol Partnership Awards, work done on funding a group of young people to obtain a national qualification from the Royal Society for Public Health.

On October 23rd the certificates were presented to several young people presented by Chief Superintendent O'Connor at Barrow Police Station.

Sergeant Travis speaking on the being shortlisted said:

"We are delighted to have been shortlisted or this award, this was originally started by Sergeant Caroline Milligan before she moved onto a new post within the constabulary, so it has been great to have carried this on.

"It has recently been highlighted that Barrow has an underage drinking problem and whilst we acknowledge that there is work to do, this work allows us to build a platform moving forward. It is a positive event for the area which has recently been the subject of negative news.

"In the future we will be looking to build on this work and use our Health Champions to further the good work that has been done."

The awards are being held at the House of Commons on the 28th January 2020.
