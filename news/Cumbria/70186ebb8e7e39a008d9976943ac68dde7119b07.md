Four people have been charged with burglary and taking a motor vehicle without the owner's consent.

The incident happened in the early hours of Saturday (21 March) in the Baysdale Close area of Barrow in Furness.

Brandon Woolveridge, 20, Reece Tarr, 23 and Oliver Hardisty, 18, all local to the area, along with a teenage boy who cannot be named on account of his age will appear at Barrow Magistrates Court today (23 March).

Cumbria Police advises all residents to remember to keep their properties locked and secured at all times, even when you are at home. Burglaries often occur as a consequence of properties being insecure and are therefore easily accessible to offenders. Don't make your property an easy target, keep all windows, doors and sheds/garages secure.
