Paul Devaney

A man has been jailed for eighteen years six months for rape, and placed on the sex offenders register for life.

Paul Devaney, aged 55 of no fixed address was sentenced today (Feb 26) at Carlisle Crown Court. He pleaded guilty to three counts of rape at an earlier hearing on the 7th December 2020.

The counts are in relation to two incidents against one woman, once when she was a child, and an incident against another woman.

Detective Constable Chris Burton, from the North Crime and Safeguarding Team said: "This is s a great result and I hope this brings some closure to the victims in the cases.

"Devaney showed no remorse for his actions and took advantage of his victims when they were vulnerable.

"Rape and sexual offences have a huge impact on victims and their families.

"Whilst every case is different and the outcome of an investigation can never be predicated, Cumbria Constabulary is committed to thoroughly and compassionately investigating all reports of rape and serious sexual offences. We will not stop in our drive to bring offenders to justice and hopefully this outcome will help to encourage victims of serious sexual offences to have the confidence to come forward and report it."

If you wish to report a crime or speak to an officer about an incident, please contact Cumbria Police on 101.

Further information on the support available for victims of sexual abuse is available on the Constabulary's website: www.cumbria.police.uk/Advice-Centre/Personal-Safety/Rape.aspx.
