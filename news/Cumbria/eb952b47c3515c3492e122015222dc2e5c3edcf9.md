Two men have each been charged with a public order offence.

Nicholas Petre, 43, of Rowe Terrace, Workington, and Dean Weston, 27, of Lowther Street, Carlisle, are due to appear before Workington's magistrates' court on July 14.

The charges follow the circulation of a video on social media in west Cumbria.

A woman arrested as part of officers' inquiries has been released with no further action.
