Police are urging parents in Longtown to ensure their children are not getting mixed up in anti-social behaviour.

Officers are also reminding them that children fall under the rule of six Covid-19 restrictions - and should be sticking to the rules designed to protect everyone.

The message was issued following a number of recent reports of problems in the town.

Complaints were made this week about teenagers, aged between about 13 and 17, smashing bottles and causing noise in areas such as near Lochinvar Close and Burn Street.

These follow concerns during the summer about youths climbing on the town's fire station drill tower.

Officers are also asking parents to ensure their children are returning home from school promptly, especially as some schools now have different home times.

Sergeant Adrian Dobson said: "We take all complaints of anti-social behaviour seriously and will not tolerate this having an adverse impact on the quality of life of the wider community.

"We'd like to remind parents that children are also subject to the rule of six and should not be socialising in groups above this size outside of school times.

"Constables and community support officers have the power to direct children to return home should they be gathering in groups of more than six.

"Where a child repeatedly fails to comply with requirements, a constable or PCSO may direct whoever is responsible for them to ensure the child complies with the restrictions.

"A breach of this direction can result in a fixed penalty notice being issued to the responsible individual."
