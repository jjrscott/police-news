Craig Weaver

A burglar who targeted the home of a 93-year-old woman has been sentenced to five years in prison.

Craig Weaver, 40, of John Street, Carlisle was found guilty at Carlisle Crown Court yesterday (11 March).

The court heard how on 6 December 2019, a 93-year-old woman in Upperby Road, Carlisle, woke to find she had been burgled.

The victim found her handbag had been stolen along with a considerable amount of cash.

Officers reacted quickly and identified Weaver as a suspect. They visited him at his then home address in Brisco Road and, whilst speaking with him spotted a handbag in the bin at the rear of the property.

A cut-up bank card in the victim's name, cash and other items belonging to the victim were also found.

Weaver was arrested but denied committing the burglary, telling officers he had found the handbag hanging out of a bush.

However, he was found guilty following a trial.

Detective Constable Chris Burton said: "Weaver is a prolific burglar and this particular offence had a terrible impact on the victim.

"Weaver was caught thanks to the swift work of officers on the ground who used their local knowledge to quickly identify Weaver as a potential culprit. Their actions meant they got to Weaver whilst he was still in possession of much of the victim's belongings.

"Finally we would like to thank a local business - Carlisle Windows - who, upon hearing of this incident, changed the victim's locks free of charge, providing her with a great deal of comfort and security in the days and weeks following the burglary."
