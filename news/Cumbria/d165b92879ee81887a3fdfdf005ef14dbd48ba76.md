Police are appealing for witnesses to a fire that is suspected of being started deliberately in Penrith early this morning.

It happened on King Street, with emergency services called at about 5.30am today (June 25).

A piece of property was alight outside a building housing a number of flats.

The fire was extinguished, with nobody being hurt. The front door to the property suffered some damage but the potential was there for it to be a more serious incident.

An investigation is underway involving police and Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service.

Officers are appealing for anybody who may have seen anything suspicious in this area at the time - or who has any information - to contact them on 101, referring to incident 34 of June 25.
