Leon Hull and David Foster

Three men who assaulted a man at his address and filmed it have today (Mar 19) been sentenced.

Leon Hull, aged 29, David Foster, aged 31, and a 17-year-old boy were sentenced today at Carlisle Crown Court.

All three men pleaded guilty at a hearing at Carlisle Magistrates on the 19th December 2019.

On the 17th November 2019 police were contacted by a member of the public following concerns for the welfare of a man at an address on Spencer Street, Carlisle.

Officers attended the address and seen two men running from the rear of the property who were stopped and identified as Foster and the 17-year-old.

The victim stated Hull, Foster and the boy had set him alight using a deodorant tin and lighter. The man suffered numerous injuries from the assault including a broken jaw and burns to his face and head.

A video was found on Hull's phone of the assault in which they had filmed.

Hull, of Springkell, Aspatria, was jailed for 4 years 8 months and an extended licence period of 1 year while Foster, of Abbey Street, Carlisle was sentenced to custodial term of 7 years 4 months and an extension period of 2 years, the 17-year-old boy received a detention and training order for 24 months.

Detective Constable Charlotte Jones said,

"This was a serious assault in which they took pleasure in recording and subjected the victim to a terrifying ordeal that will have lasting consequences.

"Cumbria Police do not tolerate violence and we will continue to work hard to ensure that those who think they can get away with assaulting people end up before the courts."
