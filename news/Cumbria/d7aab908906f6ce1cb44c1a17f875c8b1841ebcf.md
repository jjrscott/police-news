Residents and visitors in Keswick are likely to see a larger than normal police presence in the town as the annual Keswick Convention starts this weekend (SAT JULY 13).

The convention, which runs until August 2, brings thousands of visitors to the Lake District town every year.

As always with any large event attracting a big influx of people, police are involved with aspects of its planning and extra officers are deployed.

Inspector Rachel Gale said: "This is a major event every year in Keswick that brings thousands of visitors.

"The numbers involved are the equivalent of a small town in itself, so this means we provide extra policing resources to make sure everything runs smoothly.

"As a result residents and visitors are likely to see more officers out on the streets than they would normally."

Peter McCall, Cumbria's Police and Crime Commissioner, said: "Cumbria is an incredibly popular destination for visitors all across the world and events like the Keswick Convention see a significant influx of visitors.

"This is why it's so important for an increased police presence during busy events.

"Feedback I get from the public is that they are reassured by the police presence.

"I fully support the increased visible police presence during the Keswick Convention and indeed at other high profile events where large numbers of people gather.

"Of course we want everyone to enjoy their visit to our county and the police will do all they can to ensure public safety is the top priority."
