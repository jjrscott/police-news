Officers in north Cumbria are warning the owners of heavy plant equipment to be vigilant and take steps to protect their property following a number of thefts in the area.

There have been three incidents still currently under investigation in the Durdar, Brampton and Rosehill Industrial Estate area.

T/Detective Constable Wayne Moynan said:

"I would urge owners to remain vigilant day or night to persons in the area acting suspiciously and take simple steps to secure their property.

"Officers will continue to patrol across the area to provide reassurance to victims and communities, however, to assist us in our efforts to apprehend these criminals, please report any suspicious activity or vehicles they see to the police.

"Anyone who has any information can contact police on 101 or call CrimeStoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."

Security advice:

 * Ensure that all sites are locked and secure
 * Don't leave keys or valuables in vehicles and machinery
 * Note serial numbers or model numbers
 * Lock tools and machinery away and out of sight when not in use as they could be taken or used to gain access to surrounding buildings.
 * Install security lights
 * Consider CCTV as additional security for vulnerable areas
 * Consider an audible and monitored intruder alarm system
 * Tracking devices or security marks such as forensic marking or engraving.

Anyone with any information or to report suspicious activity can contact police on 101, fill out an online reporting form here, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
