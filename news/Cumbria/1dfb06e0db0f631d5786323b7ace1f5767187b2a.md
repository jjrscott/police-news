Officers are appealing for witnesses after a VW Golf driven by a 90-year-old man collided with a tree.

The collision occurred at around 12.30am this morning (21 Aug) after a silver VW Golf left the M6 between junctions 36 and 37 northbound near to Preston Patrick, went off the road and collided with a tree.

It is not believed any other vehicles were involved in the incident.

The driver and lone occupant of the car - a man aged 90 from Northern Ireland - suffered serious injuries.

The man currently remains in hospital this morning with potentially life-changing injuries.

Officers would like to appeal for any witnesses to come forward. They would particularly like to hear from anyone with dash cam footage who was in the area at the time.
