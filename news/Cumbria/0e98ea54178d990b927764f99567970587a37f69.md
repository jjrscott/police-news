Police can confirm that the death of a woman following a fire at a property, near Broughton-in-Furness, is not believed to be suspicious.

Joint scene examination work by police and Cumbria Fire & Rescue Service was conducted yesterday (October 17) to establish the cause of the fire.

There is no evidence at this time of any criminal incident and the information will now be supplied to the Coroner.

A 69-year-old woman, who lived at the property, died at the scene at Thwaites.
