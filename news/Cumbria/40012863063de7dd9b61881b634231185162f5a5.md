Graham Parker

A Barrow man who was issued with a two-year Criminal Behaviour Order for alcohol related and public order offences has been given revised conditions following an appeal.

Graham Colin Parker, aged 56, of Low White Close, was issued with the order at South Cumbria Magistrates' Court on the 10th May.

The new conditions of the order prohibit Parker from:

* Being drunk in a public place other than inside licensed premises;

* Being drunk on Cartmel Crescent, Barrow in Furness.

Inspector, Jim Bailey said:

"This CBO was a great outcome when Parker originally received the order in March, I hope that the revised conditions will allow him to reflect on and change his behaviour.

"Criminal Behaviour Orders are a useful tool available to the courts which can help the offender to cease further criminality and help protect residents.

"In this instance, the court agreed with our application for the order regarding a persistent offender who we continually have to deal with which takes away resources to those that genuinely require the help of officers.

"I would encourage anyone who witnesses the terms of such a court order being broken to contact the police immediately.

The punishment for breaking the terms of a Criminal Behaviour Order can be up to five years in prison."
