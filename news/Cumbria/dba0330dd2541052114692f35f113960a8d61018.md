A Carlisle man has been sentenced at Carlisle Crown Court this afternoon (6 August 2020) after he assaulted his ex-partner and two other people.

Daniel Blair, aged 46, of Whernside, Carlisle, was sentenced to a 30 month community order, an indefinite restraining order and must complete 150 hours of unpaid work.

Blair was arrested and subsequently charged in July 2019, with causing actual bodily harm to his now ex-partner and for common assault on a child and another woman, which he initially denied, before changing his plea to guilty in June of this year.

In April 2019, Blair pushed his ex-partner down a flight of stairs before launching a sustained assault. All of this was witnessed by the child who he then assaulted, with the assault on the other woman reported to have happened in June 2019, following a disagreement between the two.

Detective Kerry Gibson, North Cumbria CID, said:

"Blair is a dangerous offender who caused undue suffering to his victims.

"Domestic abuse is a priority for Cumbria Constabulary and we deal with all reports sensitively and professionally. If you are a victim of abuse or know someone who may be suffering, please come forward and we can help you get the support you need and keep you safe.

"Please do not suffer in silence".
