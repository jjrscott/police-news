Police are appealing for help from the public in identifying further tools and bicycles that have been seized as part of an investigation into a number or burglaries in south Cumbria.

On the 20th September, officers seized a variety of tools and bicycles from an address in Kendal, photos of which were publicised.

Further tools were seized yesterday, (25 September) many of which have identifying marks and serial numbers.

A 45-year-old man from Kendal has been arrested and released under investigation in connection with the burglaries.

We are asking the public to please contact DC 1398 on 101 if you believe that your property may be included in the seized items.

Before calling, please make a note of any information that could assist officers in identifying if you are the owner. This includes the date that your property were stolen and details including serial numbers and identifying marks or features.
