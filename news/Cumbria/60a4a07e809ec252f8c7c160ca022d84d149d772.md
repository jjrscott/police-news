Police in north Cumbria are encouraging farmers to help prevent equipment theft by signing up to a security and registration scheme.

Those in the agricultural world can come along to Harrison & Hetherington at Rosehill, Carlisle, on Tuesday (October 8), from 10am until 3pm.

For a small charge, tractors and quad motorcycles can be marked to prevent theft by joining a datatag scheme at the CESAR IT day.

This aids retrieval of stolen property - and the identification it is being used reduces the risk of having the equipment stolen.
It uses state-of-the-art identification, which is extremely difficult to remove or deface.

Peter McCall, Police and Crime Commissioner, said: "This is a fantastic opportunity for Cumbrian farmers to find out what is available to help protect themselves from becoming victims of theft.

"Cumbria is a mostly rural county and we need to work together to ensure that more isolated communities aren't left vulnerable to petty and organised crime.

"Thieves that need to linger and spend longer in their attempt to steal will more than likely give up due to the risk of being caught increasing. Let's make sure we make it as difficult as possible for criminals to get what they want.

"I would urge all farmers to sign up to the scheme and come along to the event."

For more information and to book a time, contact Susan Holliday on 07773178270.

Registration documents will need to be brought with you on the day.
