Cumbria Police are appealing to local drug users to be extra cautious when consuming illicit substances.

Police fear that increased boredom, anxiety and a disruption to regular routines due to Covid-19 could lead to erratic drugs use, resulting in adverse consequences.

Police are particularly concerned by the increase in use of illicit or 'street' pills that may have the appearance of legitimate pharmaceutical products.

Detective Chief Inspector Cooper said:

"Any pill or drug with the appearance of being a legitimate pharmaceutical product should always have been provided or prescribed by a medical professional or pharmacy.

"Any pills or medicine bought on the streets or online and consumed could cause a serious adverse reaction or even prove fatal because they are being made and sold illegally without any regulation or regard for the end user, please don't take the risk".

Police would like to appeal to the public for information on anyone selling illicit drugs, whether it be perceived 'hard drugs' or pills, all of these drugs are harmful to individuals and the community.

Anyone with information on the sale of illicit drugs is asked to call police on 101, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
