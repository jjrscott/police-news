This morning (May 29) District Judge Chalk granted the Constabulary's first application for a Closure Order under the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014. The Order closes a premises on John Street, Workington and prohibits anyone from entering or remaining at the property for a period of three months.

The application followed regular reports from local residents of disorderly, offensive and criminal behaviour as well as serious nuisance which were associated with the tenant of the property.

The lives of those living locally to the property have been blighted for years and the respite the Order will bring to them is welcomed. The numerous and frequent visitors to the property had also shown no regard for the Covid-19 guidelines.

Sergeant Scott Adams said:

"I am pleased the Court has taken into account the amount of disruption and misery caused to the local community and I'm sure it will be a relief for them to know that this property has now been closed for the next few months. This closure is necessary to protect innocent members of the community who want to enjoy a peaceful private life.

"A lot of work between officers and the Constabulary's Legal Services department has gone into putting a strong case together to present to the Court and we are happy with this outcome."
