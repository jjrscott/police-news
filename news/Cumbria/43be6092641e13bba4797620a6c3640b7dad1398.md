CCTV still 1

Officers investigating a burglary/fraud offence which occurred between 31 May 2019 and 1 June 2019 have released images of a man they wish to speak with in connection with their investigation.

The burglary initially occurred at The Grange Hotel, Grange over Sands, where the victim had several bank cards stolen and then received a phone call from a male purporting to be from the fraud team requesting the pin code following suspicious activity on the card.

The stolen card was then used at Barclays, Hanley, Stoke on Trent where a large amount of cash was withdrawn using the pin code.

Cumbria Police are keen to speak to the male pictured. Anyone who recognizes the male or has information about the incident are asked to contact PC 2335 MATTHEWS on 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Police would also like to remind members of the public not to pass out personal data/bank pin codes over the phone to persons they do not know in order to prevent them becoming victims of crime.
