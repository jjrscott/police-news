At around 4.32pm yesterday (21 March) police officers rescued a woman who was in difficulty after entering the water at the River Eden near Carlisle.

Officers from the Pro Active Support Group together with assistance from several members of the public, quickly located the woman and officers rescued her back on to the riverbank where first aid was administered. She is now safe and well.

Inspector Gill Cherry said: "I would very much like to thank the members of the public that assisted our officers yesterday afternoon. The quick thinking of everyone involved contributed to saving this woman's life. A good news story that shows people working together in this time of uncertainty."
