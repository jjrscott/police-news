Jamie

The family of 14-year-old Jamie Bragg, who sadly died suddenly at home in Workington on Wednesday (15 July), have paid tribute to him by saying:

"Jamie was the most caring, loving and intelligent young man and was loved by many. He was a keen gamer and was usually found playing on his PlayStation 4, which he loved and was very good at.

"Jamie had a great sense of humour, he could make anybody laugh and never failed to entertain us all. He also loved dogs, any dog that he would see in the street he would stroke, even if we had to tell him not too because it could bite him, he didn't care, he was a big animal lover. Football was also one of Jamie's passions and he loved to watch his favourite team, Liverpool FC play.

"Jamie will be sorely missed as a son, brother, grandson, cousin, nephew and as a friend. Jamie - you will never walk alone".

Cumbria police are not looking for anyone else in connection with this incident and it is being treated as non-suspicious.
