The Prime Minister announced to the country last night new measures to reduce our day-to-day contact with other people, effective immediately.

The measures are:

* People must stay at home, except for very limited purposes

* Non-essential shops and community spaces will close

* All gatherings of more than two people in public will be stopped

More details can be found on the Government website here.

Every citizen must comply with these measures and the police are to be given the powers to enforce them.

Assistant Chief Constable Andrew Slattery, the Chair of the Cumbria Local Resilience Forum, said:

"Last night the Prime Minister issued direct instructions to the public to follow the new social distancing measures. These instructions are in place to protect the NHS and our most vulnerable members.

"I strongly urge people to follow the Government's instructions. Social distancing will save lives and I urge everyone in Cumbria to ask whether they are limiting themselves to only essential travel.

"These measures are in place to stop the spread of the coronavirus and I urge and expect everyone to comply with them.

"Police officers in the United Kingdom police through the consent of the community and will give advice to people where necessary.

"But where people are wilfully ignoring these instructions and refusing to engage in the nationwide effort to fight the spread of coronavirus, officers will take action.

"You will see increased patrols around the county in the coming days and weeks as our officers carry out their duty to protect life and improve safety and well-being for all Cumbrians."
