A Penrith man who was wanted by police has been jailed for six months.

Ricky Murphy, 23, of Carleton Road, Penrith had been detained by officers in Carlisle and appeared at Carlisle Magistrates' Court yesterday (5 Dec).

Murphy admitted three charges of driving whilst disqualified and one of failing to provide a blood sample.

As well as being jailed for six months, he was also banned from driving for a further 18 months.

Officers would like to thank members of the public for their response to the wanted appeal issued last month.
