Clean up

Mini police from Thomlinson Junior School, Wigton today (October 8) attended Mawbray beach to conduct a clean-up as part of Wildlife and Rural Crime week which runs till the 12th October.

Despite the windy conditions the mini police collected a variety of rubbish including fishing twine, balloons, plastic cartons, beer cans and even an old pillow.

**Wildlife, Rural and Environmental Crime Co-ordinator, Samantha O 'Key said,**

"It was great to have the mini police supporting us in our week of action against Wildlife and Rural Crime. It's disappointing to see the amount of rubbish that we collected but great to see young people getting involved in protecting the environment.

"It's an offence to litter and fly tip and it is not just an eye sore but they cause harm to our wildlife and their habitat."
