Officers from Cumbria Constabularies road safety team worked alongside partners from the DVSA carried out check point checks at Todhills on the M6 northbound.

During the operation a hire van was stopped which was carrying kitchen units nearly double the weight limit the vehicle should be carrying.

The driver received a ticket for being dangerously overloaded and was prohibited from continuing his journey until a suitable vehicle was acquired.

Also stopped during the operation was:

 * One truck operating without an operator's licence
 * One overweight trailer
 * Van not road worthy - prohibited from continuing their journey.

Collision reduction officer Norman Black said" Operations such as this allow us to engage with those on our roads but also enforce those committing driving offences.

"If you overload your vehicle it will impact your braking distance and take longer for the vehicle to slow down, also on an incline the vehicle will travel faster than anticipated and again will take more time and distance to slow down.

"There is also the risk of the vehicle being imbalanced and causing the driver to lose control."
