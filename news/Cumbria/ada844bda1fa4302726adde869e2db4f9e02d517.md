Missing: Leanne Smith

Officers are continuing their appeal for Leanne Smith, who has been missing from Whitehaven since Sunday 15th September this year, after leaving her home in the Woodhouse area of Whitehaven at approximately 6pm on that day.

The investigation has so far included searches of coastal, rural and urban areas in and around Whitehaven, utilising specialist trained search officers, police dogs and police drones, police helicopter and with the assistance of the Coastguard.

In addition, specialist officers have been utilised to conduct technical and forensic enquiries, in an effort to locate Leanne. These technical and specialist enquiries have continued throughout the investigation thus far and continue as new information becomes available.

**_Inspector Jim Lloyd said:_**

"We continue to assess all lines of enquiry as they come in. I would urge anyone with any information regarding Leanne's whereabouts, no matter how small, to contact police.

"Over the next week, there will be PCSO's going door to door again, in the area where Leanne was last seen. This is to try and gather further information from the public, which they might not have recalled at the time or thought relevant, during previous appeals and enquiries.

"We are fast approaching the festive holidays and with Christmas only a week away, the community will be quite rightly turning their thoughts to spending time with their family and friends. Leanne's family do not have the luxury of that family contact to look forward to. Cumbria Constabulary are continuing to try and obtain answers for them. If anyone does have any information about Leanne's whereabouts we would ask them to contact us on 101."
