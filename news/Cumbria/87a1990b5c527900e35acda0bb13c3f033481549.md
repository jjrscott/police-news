Detectives investigating a sexual assault which occurred in Carlisle have arrested two men on suspicion of rape.

A 19-year-old man and 17-year-old man, both from Carlisle, remain detained for questioning.

The arrests follow a reported incident which occurred in the Wigton Road area yesterday morning (29 September).

The victim, aged in her 20s, is being supported by specialist officers and enquiries are ongoing.

Detectives are continuing their appeal for witnesses. They would like to hear from anyone who witnessed two men riding mountain bikes near to the B&M store on Wigton Road between 2:45am and 5am yesterday morning.

Any local residents or businesses who may have footage, from CCTV, dashcam or doorbell cameras, capturing the two men riding bikes are also encouraged to make contact.

Detective Chief Inspector Jenny Beattie, North Cumbria Crime and Safeguarding Team, said:

"I would like to reassure the public that incidents such as this are rare. A team of detectives are continuing with their enquiries and we would welcome the public's support by reporting information which could assist."

Anyone with information should contact police by calling 101 and ask to speak to an officer from the North Cumbria Crime and Safeguarding Team, quoting incident number 36 of 29 September. Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
