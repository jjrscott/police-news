Scott Hornby

A 41-year-old man from Barrow has been jailed for over 2 year after burgling a property in the town.

Scott Hornby, of Cliffe Lane, Barrow was sentenced on Wednesday 5th June at Preston Crown Court to 2 years 4 months after pleading guilty to burglary.

On the 30th February, Hornby entered a property before for being disturbed by the occupants. The occupants of the property heard noises from downstairs and located Hornby hiding behind a door before escorting him from the property.

Officers made a quick arrest and Hornby was charged with burglary.

Detective Constable Kate Edkins said:

"We do not tolerate burglaries of any kind in Barrow. Those who do commit such crimes can expect to face a police investigation and prosecution.

"We welcome the sentence handed out by the court and Hornby now has time to reflect on what he has done."
