Wanted: Jake Harper

Officers are requesting the public's help in locating a 20-year-old man wanted for failing to appear at court.

Jake Anthony Harper has connections to Ulverston in south Cumbria and Rossendale in Lancashire.

Harper failed to appear at court after he was charged with being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs in Ulverston last year.

An appeal for information on his whereabouts was broadcast on the BBC's Crimewatch Roadshow today (March 10).

Anyone with information is asked to contact Cumbria Police on 101.

Alternatively, if you prefer to remain 100% anonymous, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
