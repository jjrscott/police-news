Spelman and Riddick

A pair of prolific shoplifters were yesterday (5th August), sentenced at Barrow Magistrates Court,to time in jail and Criminal Behaviour Orders (CBO) following a string of persistent offending.

Ian Riddick, 39, of Broad Close, Barrow, received a 35 week custodial sentence and a two year CBO.

The terms of his CBO are, for the next two years not to enter:

 * Tesco on Rawlinson Street
 * TK Maxx on Hollywood Park
 * Debenhams on Portland Walk
 * Heron Foods
 * JD Sports
 * The Co-Op on Oxford Street

Amy Spelman, 27, of Crosslands Park, Barrow, received a 16 week custodial sentence and a two year CBO.

The terms of her CBO are, for the next two years not to enter:

 * TK Maxx on Hollywood Park
 * Morrisons Stores on The Strand
 * Debenhams on Portland Walk

The Criminal behaviour orders were applied for by Barrow Police's Problem Solving Team, and are the result of many hours of hard work and partnership working with these local businesses.

A spokesperson for the department said,

"Riddick and Spelman are prolific shoplifting offender's well-known to the police and the courts. Their offending targeted both local businesses and bigger chains, causing sustainable losses, distress and a wider impact to these business owners.

"Criminal Behaviour Orders are valuable tools to both ourselves and the courts to help curtail this type of offending, for those who persistently commit crimes. It is my hope that the terms of these orders will help give some well-deserved respite to our local businesses.

"We would urge the people of Barrow to assist us and the courts in enforcing these orders. If you witness Riddick or Spelman breaching the terms of their orders, please contact police immediately."

"Riddick and Spelman's CBOs will last for two years, until 5 August 2021. Breaking the terms of a Criminal Behaviour Order could result in a prison sentence of up to five years in prison".
