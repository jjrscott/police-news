Police are concerned for the welfare of 57-year-old Timothy Winter from Carlisle, who was last seen on London Road on the 12th December at 10am.

Timothy is described as slim build, grey thinning hair, wearing a white parker style jacket, blue denim jeans and leather boots. He could also have in his possession a bright yellow push-bike.

Anyone with information should contact police on 101. Officers would also like to urge Timothy to contact this number if he sees this appeal.
