Cumbria Constabulary can confirm an investigation is ongoing into an incident of physical and sexual abuse that was reported yesterday evening (19 May).

The Constabulary are aware of a post issued by a member of the public earlier today on social media concerning the incident, which was reported to have occurred in the Barrow-in-Furness area.

Detective Chief Superintendent Dean Holden, Head of Crime and Safeguarding at Cumbria Constabulary, said:

"The Constabulary is aware of a post which has been circulated on social media concerning reports of physical and sexual abuse committed against a woman, aged in her late teens.

"These reports are currently subject of a thorough investigation carried out by a team of detectives. Enquiries, which are at an early stage, are ongoing to ascertain the full circumstances of the incident.

"I would like to reassure the public that reports of any form of abuse will be comprehensively investigated and victims will receive appropriate safeguarding."
