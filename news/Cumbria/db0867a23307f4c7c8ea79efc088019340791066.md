John MacMillan

The family of a John MacMillan have paid tribute to his life.

John MacMillan died on the 18th June at a property he owned in Barrow.

_**From John 's brother Tony**_

** **

"All the family are extremely heartbroken with all the events of the past few months and would like to pay tribute to our loving brother uncle and great friend John, he will be missed by all the family and the Barrow community of friends who knew John.

"We would like to thank all of the team involved in this very difficult case and would like to especially thank the FLO team for their compassion in dealing with this very difficult family tragedy, we would also like to thank all the friends who have made our lives a bit easier with their kind words.

"Whilst realising the errors made by the mental health service have been catastrophic nothing can turn the clock back, we can only hope this never happens to any other family and lessons can be learned.

"Maybe now we can try and resume some sort of normal life again albeit without our oldest brother and best friend. Rest in peace, John Macmillan."

_**From John 's niece Julie**_

"To anyone that crossed paths with John - whether it be a game of snooker, a pint, a taxi ride or free ride where he refused any payment out of the kindness of his heart - you'll know he was a good man, he loved a good story and you knew if you got in a taxi with him you'd be getting one! John had no expectations and just got on with his life obliviously and happy to help others- you'll be missed Uncle John"
