Luke Swindenbank

A man from Kendal has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for child sex crimes.

Luke Swindenbank, 37, of Kendal was sentenced to 12 years on Monday 29th March at Carlisle Crown Court for four counts of sexual assault by penetration of a female child under 13 years and three counts of sexual assault of a female child under 13 years.

The offences occurred between September and December 2018 in both Dumfries, Scotland and Kendal.

Swindenbank offered a not guilty plea in a trial at Carlisle Crown that lasted six days.

Detective Constable Matt McFall, officer in case said "This prosecution would not have been possible had it not been for the bravery, strength and credibility of the victim.

"Swindenbank demonstrated cowardice, weakness and implausibility which has impacted upon many lives and the jury took little time to unanimously determine his guilt.

"Cumbria Constabulary is committed to thoroughly and compassionately investigating all reports of rape and serious sexual offences. We will not stop in our drive to bring offenders to justice and hopefully this outcome will help to encourage victims of serious sexual offences to have the confidence to come forward and report it."

If you wish to report a crime or speak to an officer about an incident, please contact Cumbria Police on 101.
