Can you identify these two men?

Detectives investigating a violent disorder incident in Penrith have released CCTV images as part of efforts to identify two suspects.

The appeal relates to an investigation into an incident occurred in the centre of Penrith last month.

At 10.20pm on 19 September, police were alerted to an assault which occurred inside The Pinny in Burrowgate. The assault sparked disorder outside the bar involving 19 people. A 20-year-old man, from Dudley, was taken to the Cumberland Infirmary with serious injuries, while a 39-year-old man from Penrith sustained a minor injury.

Detectives would like the public's help in identifying two men pictured on CCTV footage.

Ten men have been questioned in connection with the incident, three of which were arrested on suspicion of violent disorder. The three arrested were subsequently released under investigation.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting incident number 273 of 19 September. Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
