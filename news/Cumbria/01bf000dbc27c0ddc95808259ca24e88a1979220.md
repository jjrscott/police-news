A book club set up by officers and staff in Carlisle has raised money to fund a visit to the Calvert Trust for pupils at James Rennie School.

The book club has been running for a number of years with donations made each time a book passes hands. Last week, PC Mike Watson presented a cheque to James Rennie School in Carlisle for £331.60.

The scheme has raised over £2,500 for local charities including Hospice at Home, Cumberland Infirmary Heart Unit and the Special Care Baby Unit.

PC Mike Watson said: "We are really pleased to be able to donate money to such important local services through the sale of second-hand books between officers and staff.

"The book club's popularity is on the increase and we hope to raise more money for local services in the future."

Kris Williams, Headteacher, at James Rennie School, said: "This wonderful donation will enable us to take our pupils to the Calvert trust in Keswick this January. This is where our pupils have their first opportunity to be apart from their families. This helps increase their confidence and belief in themselves."
