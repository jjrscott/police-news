Carroll

A man from Liverpool has today been jailed for 3 years 9 months after being found guilty of drugs and money laundering offences.

Daniel Carroll, 21, of Oakhill Park, Liverpool, appeared at Preston Crown Court today (13 March) where he was sentenced after being found guilty of two counts of possession with intent to supply a class A drug, possession of criminal property and possession of a Class B drug.

Carroll was arrested on the 20th January 2020 when he attempted to run away after spotting two police officers while he was walking along the Crellin Street area of Barrow.

Heroin, crack cocaine and ketamine valued at over £1,200, along with £500 in cash was subsequently found in his possession and he was detained under the Misuse of Drugs Act.

Carroll was also sentenced for offences relating to the supply of Class B drugs in Merseyside.

A spokesperson from the South Area Drug Squad said: "This sentencing is a result of proactive policing and joint working between numerous departments within Cumbria Police.

"This is another example of our determination to identify and apprehend those who peddle drugs within our communities.

"Cumbria Police will continue to target those involved in drug supply."
