Police are investigating after a man suffered a head injury near Carlisle city centre in the early hours of this morning (June 8).

Officers were called to Robert Street, which leads from Crown Street, off Botchergate, by the North West Ambulance Service at 4.54am.

A 55-year-old man, from Carlisle, had suffered a head injury and was taken to hospital.
He is currently at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle in a critical condition.

The injured man is 5ft 9ins tall, of very stocky build. He was wearing a pale blue short-sleeved patterned shirt with a dark bodywarmer on top, dark blue jeans and Chelsea boots.

Police are investigating the circumstances and are keen to speak to a man who officers are aware was with the injured man at the scene at the time.

He is described as white, in his early twenties and short in height, with short hair. He was wearing a grey tracksuit top, jeans or tracksuit bottoms and black-and-white trainers.

Detective Chief Inspector Helen Harkins said: "We would ask this man to come forward to help us establish the circumstances.

"If you are that man or you know who it might be, please contact us.

"If you were in the area of Robert Street, James Street, Crown Street, between 4am and 5am, did you see these two males together?"

If you have any information or saw either of the two men, please call 101, referring to log 51 of June 8.
