Police have put a precautionary cordon in place on a stretch of Michaelson Road, from Bridge Road to Hindpool Road, in Barrow after a number of pieces of ordnance were found in a building this morning.

Officers were called at 10.31am today (Sept 15) after the discovery of what is believed to be military ordnance.

Officers are working with partner agencies ahead of the arrival of a EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) team.

The public is asked to avoid this area until the incident is concluded.
