Joshua Sibbald

A Workington man has been jailed today (July 17) at Carlisle Crown Court.

Joshua Sibbald, 21 of Salterbeck, Workington, has been sentenced to three years, for eight counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child.

Sibbald also received a five year Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO) and will need to sign the sex offenders register for life.

Detective Constable Leanza van der Westhuizen said:

"Sibbald is a dangerous and predatory man who groomed his victim, and threatened to harm himself if his victim didn't continue to see him. He was very manipulative and lied about knowing his victims age adamant they were of age.

"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the victim for their courage in assisting our investigation.

"It's important that people are vigilant when speaking with people online. There are people, like Sibbald, who seek to exploit young people. It is also important for parents to make sure they know who their children are talking to online."
