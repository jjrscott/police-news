Police are investigating an attempted robbery at a Workington convenience store.

Shortly after 4.45pm today (July 29) a man entered the Costcutter store on Station Road and demanded money from staff. He made off from the store a short time later without taking anything.

Inquiries are ongoing and officers are appealing for information to help locate the offender. The suspect is described as being an adult male, wearing dark clothing and a mask. The male was carrying a large umbrella throughout the incident.

Detective Constable Julie Robinson, West Cumbria Crime and Safeguarding Team, said:

"We would like the public's help in identifying the person responsible for this incident.

"Fortunately nobody was hurt during this incident and the male left empty-handed. This does not dilute the seriousness of this offence and we would like to hear from anyone who may have seen this man in the area.

"Any information, no matter how insignificant a person may deem it, could assist our inquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 quoting incident number 162 of July 29. Alternatively information can be disclosed anonymously by contacting Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
