Kyle Graham

A man has been jailed and a woman given a suspended sentence for their involvement in supplying heroin and cocaine into Barrow-in-Furness.

Kyle Graham, 21, of Redruth Close, Brookvale, Runcorn admitted being concerned in the supply of a Class A drug and was sentenced to three years in prison

Helen Ungor, 54, of Steamer Street, Barrow, admitted permitting the supply of a controlled drug on the premises and was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for 18 months.

Both were sentenced at Preston Crown Court yesterday (1 July).

The court heard how, on the night of 1 December 2019, Helen Ungor was seen acting suspiciously in Schooner Street by a Barrow PCSO. The PCSO contacted colleagues who quickly attended.

Ungor was found with two wraps of cocaine on the floor close by.

Officers then attended Ungor's home address where they found Graham. Graham was challenged as to why he was in Barrow and he told officers he had a substantial amount of cash on him - more than £2,000.

Graham was arrested and found to be in possession of three bags of cocaine, amounting to 282 wraps with a street value of between £1,500 and £3,000.

Mobile phones were recovered which showed both were involved in a county lines drugs operation bringing Class A drugs into Barrow.

In his police interview, Graham told officers he had become involved in drug dealing to pay off a drugs debt in Merseyside.

Ungor refused to answer questions in her police interview.

A spokesman for the South Area Drugs Unit said: "Graham and Ungor are the latest to learn that coming to South Cumbria to sell drugs has consequences.

"The dealing and use of Class A drugs has a destructive impact on a community. Our officers want to hear from anyone with information about drug dealing or drug use in Barrow or elsewhere in Cumbria. You can contact Cumbria Police direct or Crimestoppers anonymously."
