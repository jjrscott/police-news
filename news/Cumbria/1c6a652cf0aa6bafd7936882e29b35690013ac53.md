Police are concerned for the welfare of 53-year-old Diane Rumney, who was last seen at her home address in Greystoke at around 8pm last night (11 December).

Diane is described as 5ft 2, of medium build, with wavy, shoulder length ginger hair and is believed to be wearing a brown and white rugby style top with grey jeans. Diane left home in her car which is a blue Toyota Yaris registration: PY17 JDF.

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101. Police would also like to urge Diane to get in touch with us if she sees this appeal.
