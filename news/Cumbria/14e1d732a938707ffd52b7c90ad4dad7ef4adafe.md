Kevin Whelan

A man who pulled a knife on an innocent member of the public and stabbed him in the arm has been jailed today (11 December, 2019) for more than two years.

Kevin Whelan, 35, of Heywood Road, Ashton-on-Ribble, Preston, admitted charges of unlawful wounding and possession of an offensive weapon and was sentenced today at Carlisle Crown Court.

The court heard how Whelan was arguing with a woman in the Shaddongate in Carlisle when a member of the public approached and tried to calm the situation.

Whelan then aggressively turned on the man, produced a knife and stabbed him in the area of his arm.

The victim received an injury between his shoulder and chest and was taken to the Cumberland Infirmary for treatment.

The incident occurred at around 9pm on Saturday, 2 November 2019.

When officers arrived Whelan had left the scene but he was arrested later that same night.

In his police interview Whelan gave no comment response to all questions but admitted the offences at court and was sentenced today to 26 months in prison.

Detective Constable Matthew Rees said: "Any assault involving a knife has the potential to end in tragedy.

"There is no excuse for people to be out in public in possession of a knife. The police take such offending extremely seriously."
