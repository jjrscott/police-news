_The following statement is released in connection with the ongoing criminal investigation into the death of a one-year-old child. _

Detective Chief Superintendent Dean Holden, Head of Crime and Safeguarding at Cumbria Constabulary, said: "Two people have been arrested as part of an ongoing investigation into the tragic death of a one-year-old boy in Barrow.

"On 6th January, police received a report from NWAS regarding an incident at a property in Barrow. The child was transferred to Alder Hey Children's Hospital from Furness General Hospital for specialist medical care due to his critical condition. Sadly, the young boy passed away on the afternoon of the 7th January.

"An investigation is underway by a dedicated team of detectives and other specialists in order to establish the full circumstances of the death in full consultation with the Coroner.

"A 37-year-old woman and a 34-year-old man, both from Barrow, have been arrested on suspicion of:

• Murder

• Causing and allowing the death of a child

• Two counts of assault/ill treatment/neglect/abandon a child/young person to cause unnecessary injury

"Both have since been released on police bail, whilst detectives investigate the full circumstances."
