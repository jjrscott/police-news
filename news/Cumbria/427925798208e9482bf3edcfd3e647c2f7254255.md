A driver has been banned from getting behind the wheel for two years after a serious crash in West Cumbria.

Daniel Ogilvie, 23, of Wordsworth View, Salterbeck, crashed his Mini in Poole Road in Salterbeck at 00.45am on 31 August 2019.

He admitted dangerous driving and having two defective tyres.

The court heard how Ogilvie had been spotted by a police officer driving erratically. He then turned onto the residential street before attempting to speed away from the following police car.

However, he lost control of his car almost immediately, travelling at around 57mph on a 30mph road, and colliding with stationary vehicles.

Ogilvie suffered serious injuries in the collision and was placed into a coma.

He appeared at Carlisle Crown Court via Skype and was sentenced to eight months in prison suspended for 18 months and complete 140 hours of unpaid work. He must also complete an extended re-test - following his 24-month driving ban - before he can drive again.

Sergeant Callum Young said: "Daniel's driving was extremely reckless given it was on a residential street and he was driving on defective tyres.

"The resulting collision was extremely serious and left him fighting for his life.

"I can only hope the result of his actions serves as a wake-up call to him and any other driver considering behaving in the same manner."
