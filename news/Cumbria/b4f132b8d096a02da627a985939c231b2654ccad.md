A warrant executed by officers from Cumbria Police's South Area Dugs Unit and South Proactive Support Group has resulted in three being charged and appearing at court this week.

Officers attended Steamer Street in Barrow on Tuesday (11 Aug), forcing entry at two addresses and making four arrests.

Michael Claughton, 37 of Steamer Street, Barrow, Helen Ungor, 54, of Steamer Street, Barrow and Reece Roach, 21, of Window Lane, Liverpool have all been charged with conspiracy to supply Class A drugs.

They all appeared at Barrow Magistrates' Court on Thursday (13 Aug) and were remanded in custody to appear at Preston Crown Court on Friday, 11 September 2020.

The fourth arrest was a 15-year-old from the Liverpool area. He has been released on bail.
