Robert Lawless

A man has been sentenced today to 32 months in prison after a one-punch assault left a man with devastating head injuries.

Robert Lawless, 19, of Oaklands Drive, Carlilse, admitted a charge of grievous bodily harm and was sentenced today at Carlisle Crown Court.

Shortly before 5am on 8 June 2019, a Lawless got into an argument with a man aged 55 who he then punched in the head.

The man fell backwards, hitting his head against the concrete ground.

The assault took place in Robert Street in Carlisle.

Following the assault, Lawless went into a nearby pizza takeaway and was heard to say: "I punched him. I think I killed him. I only punched him once."

Lawless was arrested but initially refused to answer officer's questions.

However, he then provided a written statement in which he admitted having punched the man.

Lawless admitted GBH at court. He was sentenced to 48 months in prison, reduced to 32 months following his early guilty plea.

T/ Detective Superintendent Helen Harkins said: "People need to understand that a single punch has the potential to kill.

"In this instance, this one-punch assault caused traumatic brain injuries which could easily have proved fatal if not for the swift and effective work of medical professionals.

"However, the result of this single moment of violence is a victim who has suffered injuries which could potentially impact the rest of his life and an offender who will now serve a sentence in prison.

"I can only hope this incident can serve as a warning to people about just how dangerous a single punch can be."
