John Hosker

A Sedbergh man has been jailed for eight years for committing a child sex offence.

John Hosker, aged 37 of Birks Lane, Sedbergh was sentenced today (November 11th) at Durham Crown Court.

He previously appeared in court on the 11th October 2019 where Hosker was found guilty following a trial.

This offence was committed in April 2018.

**Temporary Detective Constable Georgia Crowther said:**

"Hosker is a dangerous man who targeted a vulnerable young child.

"Hosker showed no remorse for his actions, the victim has shown great courage despite having to go through the additional trauma of a crown court trial.

"Sexual assault has a huge impact on victim and their families and I hope today's sentencing brings some form of closure to the brave victim in this case."

"Cumbria Constabulary is committed to thoroughly and compassionately investigating all reports of sexual offences. We will not stop in our drive to bring offenders to justice and hopefully this outcome will help to encourage victims of sexual offences to have the confidence to come forward and report it."
