Police are investigating two incidents of assault in Kendal this weekend that may be linked.

The first incident happened at around 9.35pm on Friday (29 November), on Sandes Avenue, Kendal.

A 15-year-old girl was approached by a man described as in 40s, with a short beard and wearing a jacket.

The offender grabbed the girl's collar before waving a Swiss army knife at her. The girl then managed to run away.

The second incident happened at around 8.15am this morning (30 November) on the riverside next to Dockray Hall industrial estate. A 37-year-old woman was approached by a man described as around 5ft6, of skinny build with a thin face and stubble. The man put his hand over the victim's mouth before she ran away.

Police are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed either of these assaults, or anyone who was in the area at these times who may have seen a man matching the descriptions, to call police on 101, quoting log numbers 192 of the 29th November and log 65 of the 30th November.
