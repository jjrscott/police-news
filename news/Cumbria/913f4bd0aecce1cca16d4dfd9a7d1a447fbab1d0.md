Jailed: Mark Proudfoot and Tammy Potts

A pair who robbed a man in a Carlisle street have been jailed.

Mark Proudfoot, aged 33, and Tammy Veronica Potts, aged 45, were sentenced today at Carlisle Crown Court (December 10).

The pair were jailed after pleading guilty following a police investigation into an incident that occurred earlier this year.

On August 19, Proudfoot and Potts robbed a man in his late 60s on Milbourne Street. The victim was sitting on a bench when approached by both Proudfoot and Potts, who demanded money. The pair subsequently grabbed the victim's mobile phone and made off.

Officers responding to the incident were able to quickly track the phone down and find both Proudfoot and Potts.

Proudfoot, of Bowscale Close, was jailed for 40 months while Potts, of Orchard Street, was sentenced to 32 months.

Detective Constable Lisa Atkinson, North Cumbria Crime and Safeguarding Team, said: "We are pleased that both Proudfoot and Potts have been jailed for their role in this street robbery.

"They targeted the victim and demanded money from him. Fortunately the victim was not injured during this incident but the impact of being involved in a robbery may have a lasting effect.

"Their imprisonment means Carlisle is a safer place. I hope today's sentencing sends out a clear message to anyone who would consider engaging in such activity that Cumbria Police will do all it can to ensure offenders are brought to justice."
