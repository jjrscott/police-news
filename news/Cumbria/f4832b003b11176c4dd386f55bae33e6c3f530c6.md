The family of a man who died following a road traffic collision on the A5086 near Eaglesfield have paid tribute to his life.

Robin Smith, aged 69, from High Harrington, died following a one vehicle collision which occurred at approximately 11:30am on Wednesday (5th February).

In tribute to his life, Mr Smith's family said:

"Robin was such a kind and considerate person, devoted to his family, particularly his wife, children and grandchildren.

"Ever since he was a young boy he has been interested in cars, which has followed him through his life. He had other passions such as watching sport, particularly Formula One, rugby and cricket.

"In 2012, Robin and his wife retired and moved to Cumbria. On the day of the accident Robin was doing something he loved, just driving around enjoying the views in the countryside he so admired.

"Robin loved people and was an extremely loyal friend. He will be greatly missed by all."

Mr Smith's family have requested their privacy is respected at this time.

Officers investigating the circumstances of the collision are appealing for any witnesses to contact police on 101 and ask to speak with Sergeant 2265 Stabler or reference incident number 65 of 5th February.
