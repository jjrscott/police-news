Josh Nicholson

A man from Salterbeck has been sentenced to 21 months for offences including burglary and given a five year restraining order against both victims.

Josh Nicholson, aged 24, of Topaz Terrance, Salterbeck was today (Dec 11) sentenced at Carlisle Crown Court for burglary dwelling & theft and burglary dwelling with intent to steal.

Nicholson pleaded guilty to one incident of burglary.

The burglary occurred on the 4th November at around 11pm on Salterbeck Road, Workington. The occupants of the property were in bed at the time and were disturbed when they heard a noise downstairs.

Nicholson was confronted by the owner before leaving the property.

The theft occurred on the 8th November at around 9:45am, Nicholson entered a property on Walls Road, Workington via an insecure front door.

Nicholson barged into the property without permission and walked in the kitchen then then living room where the victim was sitting before grabbing a handbag and running from the property.

**Detective Constable James Graham said** "We do not tolerate burglary or theft of any kind and those who do can expect to face a police investigation and prosecution.

"In his desperation Nicolson targeted a vulnerable individual and lied to them about the death of a family member in his bid to steal from them.

"Nicholson now has time to reflect on what he has done."
