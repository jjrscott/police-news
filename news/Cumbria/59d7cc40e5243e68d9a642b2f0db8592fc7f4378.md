Police are urging motorists to take extra care as heavy rainfall continues to hit the county.

Areas across Cumbria have experienced heavy rainfall with the weather expected to follow a similar pattern during the next few hours.

A number of road closures have been implemented due to localised flooding, this includes:

* A591 - closed between Whitecross Bay Caravan Park and Chestnut Hill in Keswick

* A592 - closed between Newby Bridge and Bowness

* A65 - closed at Devil's Bridge due to a fallen tree

* The Sands area of Appleby

* A684 - between M6 J37 interchange and Sedbergh is not closed, but is heavily affected. Motorists are encouraged to avoid this route

There are further roads across the county that are passable with care. Motorists are being urged to drive to the conditions, reduce their speed and not to attempt to drive through deep water.

Superintendent Carl Patrick, Cumbria Constabulary, said:

"Agencies across the county are working hard, including many working throughout the night in order to limit the effect of this heavy rainfall.

"Drivers, as always, are asked to make sure their cars are ready and legal to drive in these treacherous conditions being experienced today. Please forward plan any journey, affording extra time to deal with slower travel times and the additional hazards of wind and surface water which are present. All motorists are asked to drive in accordance with the conditions and take extra care for their own safety."

Police are working with partner agencies including the Environment Agency, Cumbria Fire & Rescue Service and Cumbria Highways to ensure the safety of motorists and residents in affected areas.
