A disqualified driver who sped away from police, hitting speeds of 50mph in a residential area, has been jailed for 13 months.

Kristian Scott, 27 of Brower Street, Carlisle was sentenced today (July 15) at Carlisle Crown Court for driving a motor vehicle dangerously, driving whilst disqualified and failing to stop a mechanically propelled vehicle when required by constable.

On Sunday 14th June officers witnessed a white Renault Kangoo driving erratically from Petteril Bank Road onto London Road, Carlisle.

Officers followed and indicated for the vehicle to stop in which the driver later identified as Scott failed to do so and made off at speed from officers into a residential street.

Officers persuaded the Renault through, Mallyclose Drive, Hopeshill Drive, Highwood Crescent, London Road, Cumwhinton Road, Edgehill Road and Lingmoor reaching up to 50mph at one point in a 30mph zone.

Scott failed to give way at junctions on a number of occasions and drove on the wrong side of the road and was taking corners at such speed traction was lost.

The vehicle later stopped on Lingmoor Way where Scott and a passenger made off on foot and followed onto Broome Court where he was located by officers.

Constable Peter Ross said: "We hope this serves as a warning to other motorists who think they can get away such criminality.

"Scott was driving at high speed and dangerously in a build-up residential area with no regards for others and could have caused a collision resulting in the loss of someone's life.

"He knew when he got behind the wheel that he was disqualified from driving so took the decision to speed away from police officers."
