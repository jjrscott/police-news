The A66 at Stainmore is currently down to one lane Eastbound and Westbound.

This is due to high winds making recovery of the debris difficult, following on from yesterday afternoons incident where a lorry shed its load.

The recovery team will be assessing the situation again at 5pm (30th January) and are hoping to recover the debris when the wind dies down, which is forecast for around 9pm tonight.
