Officers have arrested a teenager after a man was threatened with a kitchen knife in Portsmouth on Monday.

Officers were called at 1.45pm on May 18, following reports of a robbery in Bedford Street.

A 25-year-old man has arranged to meet someone to sell a mobile phone but when he got there he reported that he was approached by two young white men who punched him.

One of the attackers is reported to have then threatened the victim with a knife before stealing the phone, cash and a dark blue Converse bag.

The victim suffered minor injuries to his face.

A 17-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of robbery. He has been released from custody but remains under investigation as our enquiries continue.

We're keen to speak to anyone who was in the area between 1.15pm and 1.45pm and either saw the robbery or saw two people in the area that afternoon.

One was wearing grey tracksuit bottoms, a grey top and a grey baseball cap and the other was wearing a black t-shirt and black jogging bottoms.

If you can help us, please call 101, quoting 44200175832, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
