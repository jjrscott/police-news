Can you help us identify the driver of this motorcycle?

The vehicle is a blue scrambler type bike with L plates on the front and rear, and the rider is wearing a grey hoodie and jogging bottoms, with a dark helmet and boots.

This is part of an ongoing investigation into a fail to stop collision which took place in Havant.

Between 3.20pm and 3.30pm on 25 November, a motorcycle and a pedestrian collided on Southleigh Road.

The pedestrian, an 11-year-old girl, suffered an elbow fracture as a result.

The motorcyclist, who failed to stop at the scene, fell off the bike during the incident so may also have sustained minor injuries.
