Three men have been arrested following a report of a burglary near Liss.

We were called at around 1.40am today (Tuesday 31 March) to a report that a quad bike had been stolen from a garage in the Hawkley area.

Officers attended and shortly afterwards, the stolen quad bike was recovered.

Another vehicle was then spotted nearby and officers, with support from colleagues at NPAS, tracked it to Hartley Wintney, where the arrests were made.

A 31-year-old man from Farnham, Surrey, a 24-year-old man from Sandhurst, Berkshire, and a 33-year-old man from Yateley were arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle.

They are currently in police custody.

Anyone with information on this incident should call police on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44200115611.
