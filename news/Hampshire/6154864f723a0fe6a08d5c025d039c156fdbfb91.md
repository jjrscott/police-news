We are appealing for witnesses after a collision between a quad bike and a pedestrian in Aldershot on Sunday (January 5).

Officers are investigating after the collision at the car wash in the Shell petrol station in High Street between 4pm and 4.30pm.

The quad bike had been unloaded from the back of a Ford Transit Tipper van to be cleaned in the car wash. It was then involved in the collision with a pedestrian, briefly pinning them against a wall.

The pedestrian was taken to hospital having suffered bruising and soft tissue damage to his legs.

Following the collision, the rider of the quad bike immediately left the scene in the van.

Investigations are ongoing and officers are keen to speak with anyone who was in the area at this time on Sunday, who may have witnessed the collision.

Maybe you were driving on High Street and captured the Ford van, for which the last three letters of the registration are NGJ, arriving at or leaving the car wash?

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200005740. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
