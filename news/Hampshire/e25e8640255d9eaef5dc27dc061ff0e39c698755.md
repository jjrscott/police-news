Do you recognise this man?

Police officers investigating reports of a robbery in Eastleigh are asking for witnesses, or anyone with information, to come forward.

This follows an incident which occurred at 10.35pm on Thursday 7 January at a Texaco petrol station on Southampton Road, Eastleigh.

A man entered the store and approached the till, producing a knife and proceeded to threaten a member of staff. The cashier handed a quantity of cash, with the man fleeing the scene towards the direction of Eastleigh Town Centre.

He is described as a white man, aged between 30 and 40 and of average build. He was seen wearing a red tartan patterned fur-lined hat, a black coat with white writing on the front and a logo on the sleeve, dark trousers as well as white and black Nike trainers.

Do you know this man? Were you in the area at the time and saw what happened? Perhaps you have dash-cam or CCTV footage?

Anyone with information is asked to call 101, quoting 44210007688.

Alternatively, you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
