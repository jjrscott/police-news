Do you recognise anyone from this e-fit image?

We're investigating an incident in Portsmouth where a woman was approached by a man acting suspiciously.

It happened as the woman, who is in her 30s, was walking on Albert Road, close to the junction with Waverley Road, on February 22 at around 9.40pm.

We have issued this e-fit in the hope of identifying the man.

Does the image remind you of anyone? Did you see a man matching this description acting suspiciously in Southsea on that day?

If you think you can help us, please call 101, quoting 44200067811, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
