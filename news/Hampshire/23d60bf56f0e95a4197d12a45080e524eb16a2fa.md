We are appealing for information after it was reported a man sexually assaulted a 15-year-old girl over the top of her clothing in Bitterne.

The girl was waiting at the bus stop on Bitterne Road West near to Bitterne railway station at around 12.55pm on Sunday 9 August when a man approached her and touched her inappropriately over the top of her clothing.

When the No.18 Blue Star Bus arrived, both the man and the girl got on the bus where it was reported the man sat opposite her and tried to communicate with her.

The incident was later reported to police by the girl's mother.

The man has been described as white, aged between 30 and 40-years-old with short black hair and stubble. He was said to be wearing a green short sleeved shirt, jeans & a grey bum bag.

We are making a number of enquiries with the bus company to identify the man.

If you were on this bus and saw what happened, or recognise the man described, please contact us on 101 number quoting crime ref 44200301639.
