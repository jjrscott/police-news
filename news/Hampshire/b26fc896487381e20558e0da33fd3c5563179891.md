Officers have a released an e-fit image of a man they want to speak to after a police officer was assaulted in Blackwater.

The incident took place in Frogmore Road, at the junction with Bell Lane, just before 9pm on Wednesday 3 March, after the 27-year-old officer in a patrol car carried out a stop check on a vehicle.

Three men got out of the silver Toyota Rav 4, registration number S75 NUG, and as the officer spoke to them, he was hit on the head with a metal object.

The men then left the scene.

The officer was taken to hospital where he was treated for a facial injury and swelling and bruising to his head.

Detective Constable David Clifton, said: We have released this image of one of the men we want to speak to in connection with this incident and would like to speak to anyone who thinks they may recognise this person.

"We would also like to speak to anyone who may recognise the description of the vehicle. We have carried out the usual enquiries using the registration number, but unfortunately does not show a registered owner. If you think you have seen this vehicle, please get in touch with us."

An 18-year-old man from Tadley has been arrested on suspicion of wounding with intent and has been released under investigation.

Anyone with information should call Hampshire Constabulary on 101 quoting 44210080568. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
