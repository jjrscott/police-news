Do you recognise either of these men? We want to speak to them in connection with a robbery in Portsmouth where the 50 year old victim was hit over the head with a bottle.

The incident occurred at around 1am on Sunday, July 19. The victim was visiting a block of flats in Warwick Crescent and was followed into the lift by two suspects. When he exited the lift, he was followed again by the suspects and then assaulted.

They took a quantity of cash from him and his bicycle. They continued to follow him and hit him over the head with a bottle while demanding his phone. The victim shouted for help and the pair made off through a rear exit. The victim's bicycle was subsequently recovered.

The victim sustained a lump on the head from being struck but did not seek further medical attention.

If you think you may recognise either of the men in the images, or you have any information about this crime, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200268363.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
