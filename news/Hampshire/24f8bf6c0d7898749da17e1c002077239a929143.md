Officers have issued crime prevention advice following a burglary in Romsey in which a car was stolen.

It took place sometime between 10.30pm on Monday 25 November and 8.15am the following day.

A house in Cutforth Way was entered and keys were taken from inside.

A silver Mercedes C180 was then stolen from the driveway. It has not been recovered.

We would like to hear from anyone with any information about this incident to contact us on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44190424884.

Inspector Chris Taylor said: "Burglary is currently a district priority for Test Valley, and we are working hard to identify any offenders.

"We would also urge residents to continue to report any information they may have, no matter how insignificant that information may seem.

"Burglars are opportunistic thieves who will take advantage of any opening, whether it's an insecure door or a window that has been left open.

"There are some simple steps homeowners can take to deter these thieves - please take a look at the advice below."

Our advice includes:

• where possible, park your car in a garage
• make sure your vehicle is properly dead-locked and that the alarm and immobiliser are fully activated
• keep your car keys away from any windows and doors to prevent them from being 'fished' through letterboxes, or seen by any opportunist thieves
• ensure that your front door is locked correctly - make sure you lift the handle and turn the key if you have a uPVC door)
• if you are going away, ask a neighbour or a friend to check your house regularly
• use timer switches for lamps and radios to give the impression that someone is at home
• install an alarm system and make sure the alarm box is clearly visible
• don't leave your house unattended with windows open and unlocked - even just for a minute
• if you are in the garden or upstairs, make sure your downstairs doors and windows are closed
• never leave a key under the doormat or on a string through the letterbox
