The family of 43 year old Tony Gillette, who died following a road traffic collision in Southampton, have issued the following tribute to him.

"A kind hearted, devoted family man to three children and partner, all of whom he loved with every inch of his heart. Tony has been taken away from us far too early, but he will never be forgotten and we will always keep his memories alive.

"Sometimes you will never know the true value of a moment until it becomes a memory. Loved and missed by so many."

The incident occurred on the A33 Terminus Terrace in Southampton. Tony, from Southampton, was cycling when his bicycle was in collision with a lorry at 8am on June 12.
