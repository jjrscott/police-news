Just after midnight on Wed 19 Feb, we proactively stopped a car on Calmore Drive. Upon obtaining grounds to search the vehicle, a blue Vauxhall Astra, we found

• A large number of wraps of white and brown powder
• A quantity of cannabis
• Cash
• Three mobile phones

We arrested four people on suspicion of drug offences.

Carl Anthony Johnson, aged 26 of Westridge Road, Southampton was charged with possession with intent to supply a class A drug and possession with intent to supply a class B drug.

A 34-year-old woman from Southampton was arrested for possession with intent to supply a class A drug.

A 49-year-old woman from Southampton was arrested for possession with intent to supply a class A drug.

A 43-year-old man from Southampton was arrested for possession with intent to supply a class A drug.

All three were questioned by officers and then released from police custody, but remain under investigation.

Enquiries are ongoing.
