Officers are continuing to investigate a sexual assault in Blackfield.

The incident took place at sometime between 11.20am and 11.50am on Saturday 2 Januay in the woodland off of Row Down, between Roughdown Lane and Kings Copse Road. A woman was approached by a man and subsequently attacked.

The man is described as being white, aged in his later 20s to early 30s, approximately 5'8" - 5'9" tall, medium build, pale skin, wearing a dark coloured beanie style hat, dark top, blue jeans, trainers and a dark coloured fabric mask. Following the attack he may have an injury to his eye and scratches to his face.

Previously, a 30-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of attempted rape, but after an investigation, a decision of no further action was taken.

As such, we are continuing to appeal to the public for any information or anyone who may have witnessed the incident to come forward.
