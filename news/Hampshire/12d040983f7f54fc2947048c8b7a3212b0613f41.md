Officers have released an image of a man they would like to speak to in connection with an assault in Southampton.

The incident happened between 10.30pm and 10.45pm on Saturday, 29 February in The Standing Order on High Street.

Bar staff refused to serve an aggressive man who had been taking charity wrist bands from a charity box on the bar.

When asked to leave, the man threw a glass at a member of staff.

The glass hit the 22-year-old member of staff in the face, causing an injury to his upper lip that required hospital treatment and has left a facial scar.

The man is described as being white, of slim build, light brown hair and wearing a dark grey top with light grey hood.

Do you recognise him? Perhaps you saw what happened but haven't spoken to us yet?

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting 44200077914.

Alternatively people can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
