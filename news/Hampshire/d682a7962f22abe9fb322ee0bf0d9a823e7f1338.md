Officers investigating a number of burglaries from homes in Portsmouth have today (December 19) made an arrest.

A 17-year-old boy from Portsmouth was arrested in connection with five burglaries in Aberdare Avenue on November 24, Gatcombe Drive and Drayton Road on November 25, Elmwood Road on November 29 and Mulberry Avenue on December 8.

In each of the five incidents, the home was entered a car keys taken - with four vehicles then stolen.

Enquiries are ongoing and the boy has been released under investigation.

We would like to remind people of the below advice.

• Where possible, park your car in a garage
• Make sure your vehicle is properly dead-locked and that the alarm and immobiliser are fully activated
• Keep your car keys away from any windows and doors to prevent them from being 'fished' through letterboxes, or seen by any opportunist thieves
• Ensure that your front door is locked correctly - make sure you lift the handle and turn the key if you have a uPVC door)
• If you are going away, ask a neighbour or a friend to check your house regularly
• Use timer switches for lamps and radios to give the impression that someone is at home
• Install an alarm system and make sure the alarm box is clearly visible
• Don't leave your house unattended with windows open and unlocked - even just for a minute
• If you are in the garden or upstairs, make sure your downstairs doors and windows are closed
• Never leave a key under the doormat or on a string through the letterbox
