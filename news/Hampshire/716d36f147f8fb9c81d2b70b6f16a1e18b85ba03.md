Do you recognise the clothing and backpack in these CCTV images?

If so, you might hold information that could help our investigation into a robbery at a shop in West Wellow.

It took place at the Nisa store in Salisbury Road around 5.30am on Sunday 10 November.

A man entered the shop just after it opened and threatened staff with an axe.

He stole cash before leaving the building.

No-one was injured during this incident.

The man is described as:

• white
• around 5ft 8ins tall
• of slim build
• wearing khaki-coloured hooded jacket, dark trousers, carrying a blue/purple rucksack.

Detectives have released a CCTV image of a man we would like to speak to about this incident.

Detective Constable David Jackson said: "This is a concerning incident. We are following lines of enquiry but we think the local community may be able to help our investigation.

"We are particularly keen to hear from anyone who recognises the clothing worn by the man in the CCTV images, or the backpack he is carrying.

"Were you in this area at the time and remember seeing someone wearing this clothing? Or perhaps you recognise the jacket and rucksack?

"We'd also like to hear from anyone who has noticed anyone behaving suspiciously or out of character after this incident."

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44190403599.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
