We are appealing for witnesses following a serious single-vehicle collision on the A34 southbound near Litchfield last night (December 19).

A white BMW 320D left the road and collided with a tree just after 6.30pm while travelling between Burghclere and Litchfield.

The driver, a 46-year-old man from Eastleigh, has been taken to Southampton General Hospital after suffering life-threatening injuries in the collision.

His passenger, a 22-year-old woman from Winchester, was taken to Basingstoke Hospital after also suffering injuries.

Officers investigating are keen to speak to anyone who saw the white BMW driving on the A34 yesterday evening or who witnessed the collision.

Maybe you have a dashcam and captured footage of the vehicle?

Anyone with information should call 101, quoting 44190455963. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
