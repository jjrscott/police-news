## Daniel Blakeman

The family of a man who died following a collision between a push bike and a van on Waterloo Road on July 17, has paid tribute to him.

Daniel Blakeman, aged 35, of Millbrook Road East, suffered life threatening injuries when the push bike he was riding collided with a van at 9.50pm.

Daniel was taken to hospital, but he died of his injuries weeks later, on August 11.

Hampshire Constabulary's Major Crime team has since launched an murder investigation.

Today, Daniel's family has released a picture of him, and said:

"Daniel came from a big loving family and he will be sorely missed by his mum, dad, brothers, uncles and aunties - who we're always there for him.

"Daniel will never be forgotten. He will always be in our hearts. Until we meet again - you will never be alone."
