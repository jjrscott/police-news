We are appealing for witnesses after a motorcycle, three portable fuel tanks and four large plastic containers were stolen on the Isle of Wight.

Officers are investigating after the thefts between 7pm on November 20 and 9am the following morning in Freshwater and Yarmouth.

A KTM motorcycle was taken from outside an address on Tennyson Road in Freshwater in the early hours of November 21.

Three portable fuel tanks and some plastic containers were taken from a boat yard in Yarmouth.

The items have all been recovered.

We are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed anything suspicious in either of these areas between 7pm and 9am.
