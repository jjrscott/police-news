We're appealing for information about a robbery in Aldershot on Saturday night (20 July).

In particular, we would like to speak to the occupants of a car who may have witnessed the incident.

The victim, a 21-year-old man, was approached shortly before midnight while walking along Queens Road near the junction with Lime Street, opposite the entrance to West End Park.

A group of about five men told him to hand over his watch, bag and headphones.

The suspects are described as black men, wearing dark clothing with their lower faces covered.

The victim reports that one of the men was carrying a kitchen knife, the others were carrying smaller knives.

A car went past and the group ran off with the victim's possessions including a Tag Heuer watch worth £1,500, a black Adidas backpack, a set of black and gold 'Beats' headphones worth £250, and a black wallet.

The victim was shaken but otherwise uninjured.

Officers investigating the incident would like to hear from the driver of the car and any passengers, or anyone who was in the area at the time or who knows anything about the incident.

Anyone with information is asked to contact DC Neil Plascott on 101, quoting 44190254526, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
