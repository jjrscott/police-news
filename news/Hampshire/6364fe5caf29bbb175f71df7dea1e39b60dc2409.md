We are appealing for witnesses after a silver Volkswagen Polo collided with two walls in Southsea on Friday afternoon.

The incident happened in Victoria Road North around 1.30pm on December 18.

Officers investigating the exact circumstances of the collision are keen to speak with anyone who saw the silver, 2005-plate Polo in the moments before the collision, or anyone who witnessed the incident itself.

We also want to hear from anyone with CCTV footage from the area or dash cam footage.

Anyone with information should call 101, quoting the reference 44200487278.
