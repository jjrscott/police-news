We are currently investigating an allegation of fraud in Romsey after a woman reported she received a text from the DVLA on April 13.

The text said: 'DVLA: Your outstanding vehicle tax refund from an overpayment is pending. Please visit our secure link to process.'

The link then asks the recipient to fill out their bank details.

We have arrested two 17-year-old boys from Birmingham on suspicion of fraud as a result. Both boys have been released under investigation to allow for further enquiries.

The DVLA previously warned about these kind of scams and we want to reiterate their advice. Specifically, that all DVLA tax refunds are generated automatically after a motorist has told the DVLA they have sold, scrapped or transferred their vehicle to someone else. The DVLA does not ask for anyone to get in touch to claim their refund.

When receiving any unsolicited emails, texts, or telephone calls, we would always advise to:

Stop: Take a moment to stop and think before parting with your money, personal or bank information.

Challenge: Could it be fake? It's ok to reject, refuse, or ignore any requests. Only criminals will try to rush or panic you.

Protect: Contact your bank immediately if you think you've fallen for a scam and report it to Action Fraud.
