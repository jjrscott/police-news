We appreciate it not's the best photo - but do you recognise this man? We would like to speak to him in connection with two arsons in Portsmouth in August.

One occurred at around 2am on Sunday, August 4. A wheelie bin in Heathfield Path, at the rear of the British Heart Foundation Charity Shop in London Road, North End, was set alight.

Two individual male members of the public attempted to help - one tried to put the fire out with an extinguisher.

Fire & Rescue attended and alerted residents in nearby premises to the danger.

It is understood bins at the rear of the same shop have been targeted on three previous occasions recently.

On the same date, a bin was also set alight in the service road behind the Naomi House Charity Shop in London Road.

Were you one of the people who tried to help or do you recognise the person in the photo?

If you can help, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44190277203.

If you see a fire, always call 999 immediately. No matter how small - fire can spread very quickly.
