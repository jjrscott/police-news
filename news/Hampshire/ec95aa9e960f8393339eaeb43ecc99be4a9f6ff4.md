We are appealing for information after Arrow News on Windrush Road was broken into in the early hours of Tuesday 26 May.

Four men dressed in dark clothing with their faces covered used a vehicle to break into the store by driving into the shop's shutters.

Once inside, they stole money from the till and a large quantity of cigarettes.

They then left the scene in a Silver Volvo that was later recovered.

The car is currently being forensically examined.

The incident happened between 3.30am and 4.45am on Tuesday morning.

Albeit a quiet time of night, officers are keen to speak to anyone who may have been driving through the area with dash cam footage, or any residents who may have private CCTV, or saw or heard what happened.

Please call 101 and quote 44200186495.

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
