Officers have made three arrests and seized a significant number of cannabis plants after carrying out a search warrant in Southampton.

The warrant was executed at The Polygon this morning, Wednesday 15 January.

Officers have seized around 1000 cannabis plants during the warrant.

Three men aged 18, 21 and 36 years-old have been arrested on suspicion of producing a controlled drug of class B.

All three are currently in police custody and enquiries are ongoing.

Inspector Clive Marsh of the Southampton High Harm Team has said "Today's arrests are part of our ongoing work to tackle drug-related crime in Southampton.

"Drugs can have a devastating impact on people's lives and on the community as a whole. The large cultivation of Cannabis can often be linked to serious organised crime and is also a way to fund other criminal activity. This includes the exploitation of vulnerable adults and children who are often used to sell drugs or commit other offences that arise out of issues such as drug debts.

"The fire risk posed by these large scale factories is also greatly increased, which can endanger those living or working in the immediate surrounding area.

"I'd like to reassure the community that we are determined to do all we can to disrupt this type of activity and to keep our communities safe."

If you are aware of drug-related activity where you live, then please call us on 101.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
