Do you recognise the man in this e-fit?

We want to identify him in connection with an indecent exposure in Chandler's Ford, Eastleigh.

It was reported that shortly after 9am on Monday 27 July, a woman was out running and went down a public footpath on Katrine Crescent and made her way towards Flexford Road, where a man she did not know, exposed himself and performed an indecent act.

The man is described as being white, in his 40s, approximately feet tall, slim build and clean shaven. At the time of the incident he was wearing a black t-shirt and grey trousers.

Enquiries to identify the man have been ongoing and we are now asking the public to help us identify him by releasing this e-fit.

If you know him, or have any information that could assist our investigation, please contact 101, quoting 44200280622. Alternatively, you can contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
