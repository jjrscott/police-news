We have issued crime prevention advice following an attempt to steal a car in Andover.

It took place shortly before 2am today (Thursday 14 May) in St Birstan Gardens.

Two people were seen by a car parked in the driveway. The victim knocked on a window and the two men ran away, in the direction of Anton Lakes.

Officers are investigating this incident and seeing there are any links to any other similar incidents in the area.

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the crime references number 44200170021.

We would like motorists to consider taking the following steps to protect their vehicles:

• Keep your car fob/key in a signal blocking pouch and store it as far away from the front door as possible at night, to prevent it being scanned by thieves
• Always lock your vehicle
• Double check your electric locking - manually check that the doors are locked before walking away
• Consider the use of CCTV, security lighting and a house alarm
• Consider using Thatcham-approved car alarm system, with tracking, immobilisation, anti-grab and movement sensors
