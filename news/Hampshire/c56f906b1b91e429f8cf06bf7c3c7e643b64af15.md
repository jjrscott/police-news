Officers investigating a robbery at a Havant store are appealing for witnesses.

The incident happened at the Spar on Forestside Avenue, between 5.55pm and 6.10pm on Tuesday, 25 August.

The victim, a 28-year-old man, was at work in the store when a boy produced a knife at the counter and made demands for money.

An alarm was activated and the suspect made off empty handed.

The boy left the store with another boy who had been waiting outside, believed to have been acting as a lookout.

The boy with the knife was described as a white, aged between 14 and 17-years-old, roughly 5ft 3ins with a skinny build.

He was wearing a red and black hooded tracksuit, which had a red hood and shoulders with black arms and body, black tracksuit bottoms with red stripes down the side of the legs, black trainers with a white trim, with a facemask and grey gloves.

The boy who waited outside is described as white, aged between 14 and 17-years old, around 5ft 3ins with a slim build, and short dark hair.

He was wearing a black baseball cap and a facemask, a black coat, grey slim-fit trousers, and black trainers.
