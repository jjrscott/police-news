Officers have charged two men in connection with a robbery investigation in Basingstoke.

The incident took place at around 4.30pm on Friday 8 May.

It is alleged that a group of males robbed two teenage boys who were walking in Dryden Close, Popley, before forcing them into a taxi which was stopped by police in Carpenters Down, Popley shortly afterwards. Cash was stolen.

If you saw what happened, or have any information, dashcam or CCTV footage that you think might be relevant, please call police on 101, quoting Operation Thymus.

Kesshai Clarke, 19, of Bannockburn Road, London, and Nathan Gavin Johnson, 22, of Sumner Road, London, have each been charged with two counts of robbery, two counts of kidnap and possession of an offensive weapon.

Both men appeared at Basingstoke Magistrates' Court this morning and have been remanded in custody to appear before Winchester Crown Court on June 3.

A 16-year-old boy from London, arrested on suspicion of affray and kidnap, has been released on police bail, pending further enquiries.
