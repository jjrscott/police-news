We are appealing for witnesses after a serious collision in Fareham left two men in hospital.

We were called to the collision on Newgate Lane flyover at 7.28pm yesterday, August 2, after a Volkswagen Crafter was in collision with two cyclists.

The cyclists, a 19-year-old man and a 20-year-old man both from Paulsgrove, suffered serious injuries and were taken to Queen Alexandra Hospital.

Their injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.

A 33-year-old man from Gosport has been arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, driving whilst unfit through drugs and driving whilst unfit through drink, and failing to stop after a collision.

He remains in custody at this time.

Officers have made a number of enquiries and are now turning to the public for help.

Were you on the road at the time? Perhaps you have dash-cam footage of either the collision or the moments leading up to it?

Please phone us on 101, with the reference 44200290626. Alternatively you can phone Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Acting Sergeant Robin Tompkins said: "I have been to countless serious injury collision but last night's incident has to be one of the worst I have seen in many years.

"Due to the nature of the incident we are also concerned for the welfare of any witnesses, who may wish to seek support from our partner agencies.

"I wish to thank the public for their patience and understanding last night as Newgate Lane was closed for a number of hours to allow us to gather forensic evidence at the scene."
