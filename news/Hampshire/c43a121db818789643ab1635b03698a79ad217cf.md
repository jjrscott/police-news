Do you recognise this man?

Officers have today released an image of a man that they would like to speak to in connection with a theft in Southampton.

The incident occurred at the H Samuel store in West Quay shopping centre at 1pm on Thursday 29 October.

Two customers entered the store together - with one of the suspects distracting a staff member, leaving a jewellery cabinet open in the process. During this time, a man has approached the open cabinet and stolen a solid gold men's curb bracelet - worth approximately Â£2,200. He then appears to leave the store with the woman with the stolen jewellery.

The suspect is described as having tanned skin, short dark hair and was wearing a Tommy Hilfiger black jacket with red and white stitching across the front.

Do you recognise him? Were you in the area at the time of the incident? If you can help, please get in touch by called 101 and quoting 44200431525.
