We're appealing for witnesses to a collision which took place in Winchester.

At around 1pm on Thursday 19 December, a Ford Focus and a cyclist collided at the junction of Moss Road and Firmstone Road.

The cyclist, a man in his 30s, suffered a head injury but this is not life-threatening.

Officers would like to hear from anyone who saw the collision, or who may have captured it on dashcam.

A 63-year-old woman from Winchester has been arrested in connection with the collision and remains in custody at this time.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44190455465.
