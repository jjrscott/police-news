Officers investigating a robbery in Farnborough are appealing for witnesses.

The incident happened between 6.05am and 6.15am today, 31 July, on Reading Road.

The victim, a 56-year-old man from Farnborough, was on Reading Road when he was approached by three men on a moped.

The three men assaulted him before stealing his phone and bank cards, they then made off on a red Honda moped in the direction of the A325.

The victim was taken to Frimley Park Hospital to be treated for his injuries, they are considered serious but not life-threatening.

The moped is reported to have been stolen from Peabody Road between 8pm on 30 July and 6am this morning (31 July).
