Three men will appear in court to face charges for a series of burglaries in and around Portsmouth.

Luke MacDonald, 18, of West Street, Fareham, has been charged with conspiracy to commit burglary. He is due to appear at Portsmouth Magistrates Court on June 11.

Two 18-year-old men, both from Portsmouth, have been summoned to face the same charge in court. They are due to appear at Portsmouth Magistrates Court on July 7.

It comes following an investigation into eight burglaries between February and September last year. Six of the burglaries happened in Portsmouth, with the other two happening in Fareham and Waterlooville.
