Officers investigating a robbery in Portsmouth by two men on bikes are appealing for witnesses.

We were called in the early hours of Sunday morning (March 1) after a 20--year-old man was approached on Duncan Road, Southsea.

Both men got off their bikes and threatened him with an unknown metal object, telling him to get on his knees.

They then stole his Burberry watch and rode off along Collingwood Road, leaving the victim with minor injuries to his wrist.

The men are described as being 6ft tall and were both wearing dark clothing and had their faces covered.

Were you in the area at around 2am? Did you see two men acting suspiciously on bikes?

Or do you have any private CCTV that may have captured something in the area?

We've issued a photograph of the stolen watch, so if anyone has seen it for sale since the weekend, please let us know.

If you think you can help us please call 101, quoting 44200078076, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
