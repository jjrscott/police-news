We are appealing for witnesses to a collision in Eastleigh.

The collision took place at around 2.10pm on Tuesday (22 September) on Twyford Road, Eastleigh.

An unidentified vehicle was in collision with a red Vauxhall Viva, causing the Vauxhall to collide with a parked Saab Vector.

The driver of the Vauxhall, a 73-year-old woman from Harestock, and two passengers, a 22-year-old woman and a 34-year-old man, both from Eastleigh, suffered minor injuries.

The unidentified vehicle, described as being silver, and similar to a Ford Ranger or Nissan Nivarra, left the scene of the collision.

Officers investigating the collision are keen to speak with anyone who might be able to assist their enquiries.

Were you in the area at the time? Or perhaps you have dash cam footage showing the moments leading up to the collision?

Anyone with information should call 101, quoting 44200368048.
