Do you recognise these two men?

If so, you may be able to help our investigation after Â£3,000 worth of cigarettes was taken from a lorry.

The incident took place at around 7.35am on Thursday 5 December, while the lorry was parked at the southbound M3 Winchester service station.

A Volkswagen Passat approached before unknown men were seen to break into the lorry and steal boxes of cigarettes from inside.

We have released a CCTV image of two men that we would like to speak to in connection with this incident.

Do you know who they are?

If so, call us on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44190437029.
