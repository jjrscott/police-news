Last night we arrested two men following a burglary at the Stacey Centre, in Portsmouth.

Our officers were called following the break-in Walsall Road, which happened just after 7pm.

We deployed the area and began our investigations, where it was discovered that a quantity of power tools had been stolen from inside.

A 39-year-old man and a 23-year-old man, both from Portsmouth, were arrested a short time later on suspicion of burglary.

They remain in custody at this time as our investigations continue today.

We know that this is a particularly concerning time for our local businesses but we hope this shows you that we are still fighting crime in the city and will take action to help keep our communities safer.

We are out on patrol every day and will continue to be throughout this worrying time.
