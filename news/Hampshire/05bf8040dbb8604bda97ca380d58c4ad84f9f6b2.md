A man and a woman have been jailed today after pleading guilty to a burglary on Alma Road, Southampton.

Anthony Deville, aged 38, and Emma Louise Urquhart, aged 38, both from Alma Road in Southampton, appeared before Southampton Crown Court today (6 July).

Both admitted breaking into the student property between 15 March and 6 May, and stealing hundreds of items from the address.

The court heard how Deville and Urquhart stole the sofa, TV, fridge-freezer, dining table, coffee machine, jewellery, kitchenware, clothing, and many other personal belongings.

Police enquiries identified the pair, and they were arrested on Friday 8 May. A subsequent search of their address located much of the stolen property.

Anthony Deville was today jailed for five years, and Emma Urquhart received a 32 month sentence.

Police Staff Investigator Sarah Stewart, of the Operation Hawk team in Southampton, said: "This burglary devastated the residents of the property, who had both gone home to stay with their parents during the nationwide lockdown.

"We take these crimes extremely seriously as we understand how distressing it is knowing someone has been in your home when you're not there.

"Deville and Urquhart showed no regard for their victim's belongings, clearing out the house and taking items that meant a great deal to the victims.

"The team put in a lot of hours on this investigation, and this is a great result from court this morning."
