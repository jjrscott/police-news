Officers investigating a theft from a shop in Portsmouth have charged two women.

Amy Mihell, 28 and Poppy Cadman, 26, both of Sandringham Road, Portsmouth, have been charged with theft from a shop and for contravening the coronavirus restrictions.

Miss Mihell was also charged with using threatening/abusive/insulting words or behaviour.

It comes after officers received reports of a theft from the Co-op store in Albert Road, just after 10.30am yesterday (April 8), where a quantity of meat and washing detergent was stolen.

The two women are due to appear at Portsmouth Magistrates Court today (April 9).
