Do you recognise this man?

We have released these CCTV images of a man we would like to speak to following a house burglary in Southampton.

It took place at an address on Burgess Road sometime between 9am and 3.45pm on Thursday, 9 January.

While the home owner was out, a kitchen window was smashed and various items including an iPad pro, jewellery, tools, cash and bank cards were stolen.

A debit card that was among the stolen items was subsequently used for small transactions in local shops.

We are releasing these images of a man we are keen to speak to as he may be able to assist our enquiries.

He is described as being between 20-40 years old with dark hair and a tattoo on his hand.

It is believed he may have links to the Swaythling and Portswood area.
