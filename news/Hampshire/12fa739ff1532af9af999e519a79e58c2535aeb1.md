We have charged three men following an investigation into an incident that happened on River Walk in Southampton on 5 September 2019.

Just after 1am, it was reported that gun shots were heard in the street and a large amount of cannabis was found at an address and in a nearby vehicle, abandoned in Riverside Park.

As a result three men have been charged.

Robert Johnston, aged 24 of Tennyson Avenue has been charged with conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary and conspiracy to possess a firearm.

Fardeen Hamidy, aged 26, of Bursledon Road, Southampton has also been charged with conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary and conspiracy to possess a firearm.

Christy Flaherty, aged 26, of Malmesbury Road, Southampton has also been charged with conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary and conspiracy to possess a firearm, plus being concerned in the supply of class A drugs.

Court dates for all three men are yet to be confirmed.

The investigation into the death of 20-year-old Sol Hemy, whose body was found in the water at Riverside Park a few hours after the incident on River Walk, continues.
