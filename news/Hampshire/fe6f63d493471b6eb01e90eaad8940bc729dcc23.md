We're releasing CCTV images following a burglary in Warsash.

It happened at a house in Brook Lane sometime between 10am and 4.30pm Thursday 21 November.

Two offenders smashed the glass in the back door to gain entry and stole designer handbags and a Tag Heuer Carrera watch.

We have released three images that show one of the offenders wearing a distinctive blue Moncler jacket.

We appreciate you can't see his face but do you recognise him? Did you see anyone acting suspiciously in the area around this time or have you been offered for sale any designer handbags or a Tag Heuer Carrera watch?

Anyone with information is asked to call us on 101, quoting 44190419183.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
