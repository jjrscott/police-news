Officers investigating a fraud against the Royal Winchester Golf Club have charged a man.

Steven Alexander Hunter, 53, of Mill Lane in Abbots Worthy, has been charged with fraud by abuse of position, and theft by employee. He was also charged with fraud by false representation relating to funds raised at two charity Pro-Am events held in memory of a longstanding club member.

Hunter worked as Head Professional at the golf club, and was responsible for running the shop and the collection of green fee income at the club.

He is next due to appear before Basingstoke Magistrates Court on 15 April.
