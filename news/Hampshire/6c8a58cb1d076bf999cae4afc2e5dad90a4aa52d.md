Burglar Andrew Evan Smith, of Goldsmith Avenue in Southsea, has today (Monday 29 June) been jailed for 56 months after stealing thousands of pounds worth of jewellery.

The 34-year-old pleaded guilty on 26 May at Portsmouth Magistrates' Court to four burglaries which took place in Locks Heath.

This follows an investigation by our Operation Hawk team into the following burglaries:

 * On the afternoon of 10 April this year, Smith burgled a house in St Johns Road, and stole cash and a bank card from a wallet inside.
 * On the same afternoon, he burgled a house in Warsash Road and stole watches and jewellery.
 * On the afternoon of 11 April this year, he burgled a house in Alum Way and stole jewellery from inside.
 * Later that same afternoon, he burgled a house on Brook Lane and stole jewellery from inside.

A further five offences were taken into consideration.

PC Charlotte Pocock, from the Operation Hawk team, said: "Smith caused misery to his victims, invading their homes and taking their belongings.

"No-one should have to experience that, and I am pleased that we have been able to bring this to a swift conclusion for those who have suffered because of him.

"I want to thank the many witnesses who came forward and helped the police bring this man to justice."

Smith appeared at Portsmouth Crown Court today where he was handed his sentence of 4 years and 8 months.
