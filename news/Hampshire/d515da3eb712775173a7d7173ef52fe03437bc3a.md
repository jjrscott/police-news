Officers investigating a routine stop and search, which resulted in two officers being assaulted, have made an arrest.

The incident happened just after midnight on Saturday 1 August off of Archer Road Eastleigh.

Officers stopped two men acting suspiciously and after speaking with them could smell cannabis and undertook a stop and search. During the search, an altercation unfolded and a struggle ensued. One of the men subsequently became violent when resisting arrest, resulting in two officers suffering minor injuries.

A 25-year-old man from Eastleigh has been arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a Class A drug and two counts of assault of an emergency worker.

He was released pending further investigation.
