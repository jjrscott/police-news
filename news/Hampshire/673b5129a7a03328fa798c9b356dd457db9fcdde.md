We're appealing for witnesses after four teenage boys were robbed in the wooded area south of the George Inn on Portsdown Hill Road in Cosham yesterday afternoon.

At some point between 3:50pm and 4:10pm they were approached by two men who had their faces covered and who were carrying knives. The men threatened the teenagers and a fifteen year-old boy had items including a pink and orange North Face Supreme large rucksack taken from him. No-one was seriously hurt.

The first man was described as:

 * White.
 * Between 5ft 8ins and 6ft tall.
 * Aged in his mid to late teens.
 * He was wearing a grey North Face jacket, dark trousers, and had his face covered.
 * He was carrying a Stanley knife.

The second man was described as:

 * White.
 * Aged in his late teens.
 * Shorter than the first man between 5ft 6ins and 5ft 10ins tall.
 * Heavier build than the first man.
 * He was wearing a drak coloured hooded top and had his face covered.
 * He was also carrying a knife.

Anyone with information or who has found the distinctive rucksack can call 101, quoting the reference 44200330115.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
