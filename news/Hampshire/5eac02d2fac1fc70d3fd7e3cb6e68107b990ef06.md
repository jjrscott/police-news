Detectives investigating four armed robberies across Hampshire have charged a man.

Daniel Sharpe, 26, of no fixed address, has been charged with four counts of robbery and four counts of possession of an offensive weapon.

He has also been charged with one count of possession of a bladed article.

The charges relate to four robberies at betting shops in Eastleigh and Romsey, where cash was stolen from each premises.

The first robbery happened on January 20, at Megabet in High Street, Eastleigh, where staff reported being confronted with a man holding a hammer.

The second was reported to us on January 23, when Ladbrokes, on The Hundred, in Romsey was targeted by a man holding a wrench.

Betfred in Shakespeare Road, Eastleigh, was robbed on January 26 by a man with a crowbar and Corals in Oakmount Road, Chandler's Ford, was targeted on February 6 by a man with a knife.

Fortunately no one was injured in any of the incidents.

Daniel Sharpe is due to appear at Southampton Crown Court on March 13.
