Do you know these men?

We'd like to speak to them as part of an investigation into a public order incident that took place on a bus in Southampton.

The incident happened at 8pm on Thursday, 12 December.

Two men and one woman got on the number 18 Bluestar bus in Thornhill and became abusive towards other passengers.

The bus driver stopped the bus on Bitterne Road West and asked the group to leave.

The group starting spraying what is believed to be alcohol around the bus, before verbally abusing a passenger who had tried to intervene.

The first man is described as being white, aged between 20 to 30 years old, medium build with brown hair. He was wearing a maroon jumper with a green jacket and blue jeans.

The second man is described as being white, aged between 30 and 40 years old, medium build with dark hair. He was wearing a blue Adidas t-shirt.

The female is described as being white with long dark hair.

If you know the men in these photographs or if you witnessed anything that could help with this investigation, please call us on 101, quoting 44190446974.

Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
