We're appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Basingstoke.

Between 12pm and 1pm on Wednesday 23 December, a 12-year-old boy was walking in an underpass between Shakespeare Road and Oakridge Road when he was pushed against a wall by a man he did not know.

The man proceeded to look through the boy's bag before stealing a Â£5 note from inside.

No threats were made, and the man ran off in the direction of Oakridge Road.

He was described as white, aged in his 40s or 50s, around 5ft 9ins tall, with grey hair but bald on the top, and wearing black clothing. The man was carrying a bread knife during this incident.

We believe this to be an isolated incident, and are asking for anyone who saw a man matching this description in the area at the time, or perhaps running away from the underpass.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44200494085.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org
