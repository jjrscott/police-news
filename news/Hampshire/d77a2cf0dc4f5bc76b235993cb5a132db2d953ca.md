We are appealing for information after a 23-year-old man was seriously assaulted shortly after midnight on Saturday 15 August.

The incident involved two groups men, however it was reported one group started attacking the other and as a result, one man was seriously assaulted and suffered a fractured jaw, plus bruising and swelling to his arms, legs, neck and face.

It is believed a member of the public intervened whilst the man was being assaulted resulting in the offending group to leave the area.

On August 17, we arrested a 22-year-old man from Southampton on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. He was questioned by officers and then released but remains under investigation to allow for further enquiries to take place.

In addition, we have increased patrols in this area.

We would like to hear from anyone who witnessed this incident or anyone who driving near to Mansel Park in the early hours of Saturday morning, just after midnight, to get in contact.

Please call 101 or quote 44200312061.
