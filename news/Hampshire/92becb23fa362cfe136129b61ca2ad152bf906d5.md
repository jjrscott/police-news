We are appealing for witnesses after an attempted robbery in North End last Tuesday (June 16).

A 74-year-old woman was walking on London Road around 10.35am when a man tried to grab her handbag from her.

The woman was able to keep hold of her bag and then man ran away.

Officers investigating the incident arrested a 32-year-old man in connection with the incident. He has been released under investigation.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200217252. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
