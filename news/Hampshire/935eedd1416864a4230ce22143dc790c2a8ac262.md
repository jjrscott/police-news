An extension of the Section 60 power, allowing officers to stop and search anyone in the Shirley, Millbrook, Lord's Hill and surrounding areas has been granted.

This extension will be in place until 5.59pm tomorrow evening (11 October).

This emergency power has been implemented following an incident of serious violence that took place on 8 October, where 5 or 6 people with mopeds were reported to have approached a 31-year-old man and a 22-year-old woman walking on Tangmere Drive and stab the man.

The woman also received injuries and reportedly had her phone stolen.

The 31-year-old man was taken to Southampton General Hospital with serious yet not life-threatening injuries.

We're treating this incident as racially aggravated as it was reported the group verbally abused the man before attacking him.

A 16-year-old boy from Southampton has been arrested on suspicion of robbery, GBH and possession of Class B drugs. He has been released on police bail as enquiries continue.

Between 6pm on Friday evening (October 9) and 6pm this evening, officers carried out 15 stops.

One 25-year-old man from Southampton was arrested on suspicion of drug supply offences following a stop on Anglesea Road last night, 9 October. He has been released from custody but remains under investigation.
