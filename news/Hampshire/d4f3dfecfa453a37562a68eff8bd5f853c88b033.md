A man has been jailed for 3 years after being found in possession of indecent images of children.

Thomas Powell, aged 24, of Broomy Close, Dibden was sentenced at Southampton Crown Court yesterday, (19 May) to 3 years imprisonment, put on the Sex Offenders Register for life and given a Sexual Harm Prevention Order for 10 years.

Powell pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to one count of possession of extreme pornographic images, two counts of possessing a prohibited image of a child and six counts of making indecent photographs of a child.

Officers executed a warrant at Powell's home on 14 May 2019 after intelligence suggested he had been downloading indecent images of children.

Officers from Hampshire Constabulary's Internet Child Abuse Team (ICAT) seized Powell's phone, two computers and a tablet which were analysed by a forensic computer examiner within the force. Between these devices, officers discovered over four million images and videos of abuse involving children had been downloaded and included category A images - the most serious.

PC James Giles said "Behind every indecent image of a child is a vulnerable victim and these crimes are among the most appalling that we investigate.

"Powell is a habitual collector of indecent images that include category A, the most serious kind, for his own sexual gratification.

"Tackling online viewing of indecent images is a priority for police and we will do everything in our power to bring offenders to justice."

Anyone who has any concerns about child abuse should contact Hampshire Constabulary on 101.
