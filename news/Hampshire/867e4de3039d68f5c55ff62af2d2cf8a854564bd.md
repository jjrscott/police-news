We are investigating after three men sustained injuries following an altercation in Aldershot last night (July 29).

The incident occurred at around 6pm at an address on the High Street. Two of the victims were later assisted by members of the public on the green by Burger King in Cassino Close. They were given medical assistance until the ambulance arrived.

Two men in their 20s were found to have suffered stab wounds. They are currently being treated in hospital.

A third man in his 30s was also reported as injured and received medical treatment but has since left hospital.

None of the injuries are believed to be life threatening.

Neighbourhood Inspector Kirsten Troman said: "We appreciate the community may be concerned about this incident but we believe this attack was targeted and the parties involved are likely to be known to one another.

"Officers will be carrying out house to house enquiries in the area and we will be conducting extra patrols. If you have any concerns, please don't hesitate to speak to them."
