We're appealing for information following a serious collision that took place in Hayling Island on Friday night.

We were called to Manor Road at 11.58pm on Friday, 24 July following a single vehicle collision in which a silver Vauxhall Astra had left the road and collided with a tree.

The passenger, a woman in her 20's, sustained serious and life threatening injuries and is currently being treated at Southampton General Hospital.

Her next of kin have been informed.

The driver, a man in his 30's, sustained serious injuries but not believed to be life threatening. He was also taken to Southampton General Hospital for treatment.

Investigations into the exact circumstances of the incident are ongoing and officers are keen to speak to anyone who saw the incident or anyone who might have dash cam footage that could help.

Anyone with information can call us on 101, quoting 44200277825.

Alternatively people can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
