Tribute has today been paid to a man who died after a collision involving a car and motorcycle in Basingstoke.

Matthew Joseph Harris, 34, of Dankworth Road, Basingstoke, died after his Honda CRF motorcycle was involved in a collision with a Vauxhall Vectra just before 6.30pm on January 2.

Despite best efforts, he was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

In a statement released today, his partner said: "I just can't comprehend that he is gone, he was one in a million and he was unique! Our children couldn't have wanted a better daddy, you will missed beyond words, I will love you forever."

His mother and father added: "Matt our beautiful Christmas boy gone but never forgotten. R. I. P love mum and dad, Kev and Clare."

Enquiries into the exact circumstances of the collision are ongoing.

Officers investigating are keen to speak to the driver of a dark red or maroon van who was directly behind the Vectra at the time of the collision and could have important evidence.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200002157. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
