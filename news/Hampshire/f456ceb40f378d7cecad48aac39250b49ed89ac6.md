We need your assistance in identifying this man. Can you help?

Officers are investigating a number of fraudulent activities in local pubs in Portsmouth and we're keen to speak with this man in connection with these incidents.

On one occasion, it was reported that the man entered the Mother Shipton pub at 4.45pm on Thursday 17 September, ordered two beers and paid using a Scottish Â£50\. These notes have since been identified as forgeries.

The man was seen to be getting into a silver saloon, possibly a Vauxhall Astra, with a woman and driving away from the scene.

Officers investigating the incident are keen to identify the man in this image and speak with him in connection with their enquiries.

Do you recognise him?

Anyone with information should call 101, quoting 44200363314. Alternatively, you can call independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

We are also keen to urge local businesses to be alert to these incidents and would advise them to be careful when accepting high value notes.
