Officers investigating an assault in Bordon on Sunday are appealing for witnesses.

The victim, a 25-year-old man, was on Varna Road at around 3.30pm on 3 January when he was chased and assaulted by a group of men.

He suffered potentially serious injuries as a result of the attack.

A 22-year-old man from Guildford and a 26-year-old man from Woking have been interviewed under caution in relation to this incident.

We have conducted a number of enquiries over the past few days and are now turning to the public for help.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you witness either the chase or the assault?

In particular, we are keen to hear from a man and woman who were seen on CCTV walking their dog in the area at that time. We believe they may have witnessed part of the offence.

Anyone with information that may help is asked to phone 101 with the reference 44210002545. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
