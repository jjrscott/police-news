We have a charged a man with gross negligence manslaughter following an investigation into the death of a man in Chilworth in 2019.

We were called to the site on Ling Dale at 9.33am on 16 July, 2019 following the discovery of the body of a man in his 60s.

The man was later identified as 64-year-old Kulwant Singh Athwal from Southampton.

We began an investigation into Kulwant's death alongside the Health and Safety Executive.

We can now confirm we have charged Paramjit Singh, aged 48, of Iris Road, Southampton with gross negligence manslaughter.

He will appear at Southampton Magistrates Court on January 12, 2021.
