We would like to once again extend our thanks to you for protecting the NHS and saving lives by following the government guidelines over what was no doubt an unusual Easter Bank Holiday weekend for you all.

However, we are aware that for some people, staying at home presents its own risks.

We want you to know that we are still here to help you, and there is still so much support out there if you need help.

If you are being abused, call 999. If you are not in a position to speak to us, press 55 and our controllers will know what to do.

Alternatively, you can call the National Domestic Abuse helpline on 0808 2000 246.

Please remember this - You Are Not Alone.
