We are appealing for witnesses, or anyone with information, to come forward after reports of a man indecent exposing himself in Southampton.

The incident occurred at around 3.40pm on Thursday 18 March at Trinity Road car park which is situated between St. Mary's Road and St. Andrew's Road.

A woman was walking through the underpass below St. Andrew's Road when she saw a man exposing himself. The man then followed her towards her car and attempted to gain access to her vehicle, but she managed to drive away.

He is described as being black, aged 16-19, approximately 5ft 6ins tall, of slim build and with short black hair. He was seen wearing a blue zip up jacket with a hood, grey tracksuit trousers and dark trainers.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you see what happened?

If you have any information about this incident or you recognise the description of the man, please call 101 and quoting 44210101866.

Alternatively you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

We would ask that people remain vigilant while out and about and to be fully aware of their surroundings.

If residents do witness or see anything suspicious, we would urge them to continue to report these incidents to us by calling 101 or via Hampshire Constabulary's online reporting tool.
