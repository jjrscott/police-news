Do you recognise this man?

Officers investigating an assault in Romsey on June 23 are keen to speak with him in connection with the incident.

The incident occurred just after 6.30am on Tuesday 23 June, when a can of drink was thrown at a member of staff at the Esso in Greatbridge Road, causing a cut to his head.

Since then, we have been making enquiries and we now have this CCTV image.

We are keen to speak with this man, who left the Esso as a passenger in a white van.

If you recognise him or have any information, please call 101, quoting the reference 44200227637.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
