Do you recognise the man in this E-fit?

We want to identify him in connection with an indecent exposure in Alresford.

It was reported that between 6.30pm and 6.50pm on 19 November, a woman was walking along a footpath adjacent to Jacklyns Lane, near to the Nursery Road junction, when a man she did not know approached her and exposed himself.

Officers are linking this to a similar incident which happened in the same area on 8 August this year.

We would like to identify the man pictured as part of our enquiries.

If you know him, or have any information that could assist our investigation, please call us on 101, quoting 44190416433.

Alternatively you can call the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
