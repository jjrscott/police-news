Can you help us find missing Trinity Robin from Winchester?

Trinity Robin, 45, was last seen in the area of The Shoe Inn, Exton, at 11pm on Monday, 18 May.

We and her family are becoming increasingly concerned for her welfare.

Officers have been carrying out a number of enquires to try and locate Trinity but we are now turning to the public for help.

Trinity is described as being white, around 5 feet 4 inches tall, slim build, having brown shoulder length hair and brown eyes.

She was last seen wearing a burgundy dungaree style top with a thin black t-shirt underneath, black fluffy pyjama bottoms, a burgundy sweatshirt with a logo on the front and a pair of black and white pumps. She may also be carrying a black throw or blanket.

If you have seen Trinity or know where she is, then please call us on 101, quoting 44200176486
