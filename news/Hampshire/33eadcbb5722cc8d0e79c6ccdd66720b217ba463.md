We are appealing for witnesses following an attempted robbery in Southampton.

A man was approached by three youths, one of whom had a knife, demanding he hand over money.

The three youths, all believed to be mid to late teens and male, ran away before any money was taken.

Following the incident on November 2 in Drayton Close, Weston, our officers have been carrying out enquiries and we are now in a position to release an e-fit of one of the youths we wish to speak to in connection with this incident.

We also have descriptions of the three boys.

The first is described as being white, slim, around 5ft 8ins tall and wearing a black hoodie; this is the boy in the e-fit.

The second is also described as being white, around 5ft 8ins tall and wearing a hoodie.

And the final boy is described as being white, of stocky build, around 5ft 6ins tall and wearing a distinctive black jacket with a red chevron on the back and dark jeans.

Do you recognise the e-fit or perhaps know someone with the same jacket described above?

Anyone with information is urged to call 101, quoting 44190393689. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
