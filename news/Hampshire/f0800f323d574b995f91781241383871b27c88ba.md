THREE people were arrested today (Thursday, November 12) following a series of warrants to tackle the supply of Class A drugs across Basingstoke and Andover.

Officers from local Neighbourhood Teams and Northern Investigations searched four addresses in:

* Britannia Drive, Basingstoke
* Dorset Crescent, Basingstoke
* Colyer Close, Basingstoke
* Goddard Square, Andover

A 35 year old man from Basingstoke was arrested on suspicion of acquiring, using or possessing criminal property.

A 39 year old man from Basingstoke was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs.

A 37 year old man from Basingstoke was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class B drugs.

All three remain in custody at this time.

Items seized during the warrants included quantities of suspected Class A drugs, suspected Class B drugs and a quantity of cash.

Chief Inspector Karen McManus said: "As part of our ongoing work to tackle drug-related crime in Basingstoke and Andover, we have arrested a number of people today suspected in being involved in dealing Class A and Class B drugs.

"Using and dealing illegal drugs causes so much damage to people, families and communities and very often is linked to other types of crime and violent offending.

"We want to assure the public that we take drug dealing extremely seriously and as these warrants show, those who are involved should be aware - we could be paying you a visit next!"

Anyone who thinks they may have information on potential drug dealing, contact police by calling 101 or report online via our website www.hampshire.pnn.police.uk.
