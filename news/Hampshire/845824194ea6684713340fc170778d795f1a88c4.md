We are issuing a warning to householders to be on their guard following a series of burglaries in Hartley Wintney, Church Crookham, Long Sutton, Hook and Eversley.

Officers will be conducting extra patrols in the district but residents should ensure that windows and doors are kept locked and secure. Also keep an eye on vulnerable neighbours and their properties and report any suspicious vehicles or people.

A burglary took place overnight between September 5 and 6 at a property in Sutton Common, Hook. Suspects have gained access to a barn and stole a red Canyon Spectral AL 5.0 mountain bike with purple pedals.

A further incident occurred on October 2 in Bramshill Road, Eversley, between 8am and 2.45pm. Suspects have used the victim's own ladder to get access to an upstairs window. A television, watches, games console and cash were stolen.

Another burglary took place between October 2 and October 10, at a property in Hesters View, Long Sutton. The offenders have forced a rear door lock. They carried out a search and stole jewellery.

At around 12.45pm on October 9, a suspect has forced the UPVC front door to gain entry to a property in Chesilton Crescent, Church Crookham. Jewellery has been stolen.

On October 10, suspects have gained entry to a property in Bramley Drive, Hook, between 2pm and 10.30pm, by forcing a rear door. They have stolen items including cash and jewellery.

Neighbourhood Inspector Jen Lovegrove said: "With the nights drawing in recently, it's a good time to consider your home security and think about using simple tactics to make your home appear occupied if you are out all day or away.

 "This includes using timer switches for lighting and leaving your radio on to make your property appear occupied. If you have a back gate, make sure it is locked so there is no easy access to the back of your property.

 "Other security measures include installing CCTV and an alarm and security lighting with motion sensors. For more information about crime prevention, visit www.hampshire.police.uk.

"Please contact us if you see suspicious vehicles or people around. You can ring 101 or if you believe a crime might be occurring, always call 999."
