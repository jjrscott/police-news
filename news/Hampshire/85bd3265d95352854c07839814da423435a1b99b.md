Do you know this man?

Officers investigating a burglary at a One Stop store on Portswood Road, Southampton, are keen to speak to him on connection with the incident.

A group of four men who were seen walking along the road between 3.30am and 4am on January 26 trying car doors to see if they were unlocked.

They then used a metal pole to force entry to the store and take a quantity of alcohol.
