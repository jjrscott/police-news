A man has been jailed for ten years after being found guilty of a number of offences in Southampton and Portsmouth.

Christopher Scott Bryan, aged 45, pleaded guilty at Southampton Crown Court to a range of offences including burglary, robbery and fraud - all of which occurred in Southampton and Portsmouth between 2 January and 24 April 2020.

Southampton Crown Court heard how Bryan had targeted two extremely vulnerable people during two residential burglaries, which was reflected in the sentence passed down by the judge.

Bryan, of no fixed abode, was sentenced at Southampton Crown Court on Tuesday 25 August to ten years in jail. He was found guilty of four counts of burglary, three counts of fraud, one count of theft and one count of attempted robbery.

Detective Sergeant, Simon Price, said: "Today, with the support of our Op Hawk team, an offender who acted in a cowardly manner by targeting vulnerable victims, has been punished at court and handed a substantial custodial sentence. We are pleased to see that he has been given a lengthy sentence which reflects the severity of his crimes, including the two residential burglaries of vulnerable people.

"This sentence has not only safeguarded the victims of his crimes from becoming repeat victims, but also means that local communities as a whole can feel safer going about their day-to-day business."
