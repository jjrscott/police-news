We are appealing for witnesses and information after an attempted burglary at the Co-op in Odiham.

The incident occurred at 1.41am in the early hours of Monday, December 9. Four suspects wearing masks forced entry via the side door of the shop in the High Street.

The suspects made off empty handed after being disturbed by police officers who arrived on the scene.

The suspects have got back into a silver car, which collided with the police vehicle before making off in the direction of the A287 roundabout.

Fortunately, the police officers were not injured during the collision however the police vehicle was substantially damaged.

If you saw a silver vehicle before or after this incident in the vicinity or if you have any dash cam or CCTV footage, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44190441913. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
