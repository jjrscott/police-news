Tribute has been paid to a woman who died in Portsmouth earlier this week.

Kayleigh Louise Dunning, 32, from Portsmouth, was found dead in Kingston Crescent on December 17.

Today her family have paid tribute to her.

They said: "Our precious daughter Kayleigh Louise Dunning - taken so suddenly.

"It has ripped our whole world apart. You never expect to bury your own child.

"Her brother has lost his best friend. She was so kind and thoughtful. As long as her mum, dad and brother were fine she was happy.

"The hardest thing is not being able to hear her voice and laughter, and not to cuddle her.

"Our life will never be the same. We are devastated and only people who have lost a child would understand how we feel. There are not enough words to explain how we feel.

"Rest in peace baby girl. You are always in our hearts and thoughts. We miss you so much."

A 48-year-old man from Portsmouth was charged earlier today with her murder.
