We are appealing for information following a burglary in North Baddesley in which a car was stolen.

It took place at a house in Bracken Close, sometime between 2.45pm on Tuesday 26 May and 7.30am on Wednesday 27 May.

A set of keys was taken from the address and used to take a grey Volkswagen Golf.

The car has since been recovered.

We are keen to hear from anyone with information on what took place.

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44200188129.

Alternatively people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

**Advice**

We would like to take this opportunity to remind people of the steps they can take to protect their vehicles:

• Always lock your vehicle, even when filling up or parked on your drive, and check you haven't left the windows or sunroof open
• Keep your keys safe and out of view when at home, and away from the front door
• Avoid parking in dark and secluded areas
• Fit a good steering wheel, gear lever or clutch pedal security device
• Double check electric locking before walking away
