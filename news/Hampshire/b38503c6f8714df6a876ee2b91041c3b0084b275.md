We are appealing for witnesses after a fatal collision on the A303 at Andover on Friday morning.

Officers were called at 8.28am on January 22 to reports of a collision involving a white Ford Transit van and a red DAF lorry on the A303 near to the junction with Winchester Road.

The driver of the van, a 41-year-old man, was sadly pronounced dead on the way to hospital. His family have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers.

Enquiries are being conducted into the exact cause of the collision, and we are keen to speak with any witnesses who may help our investigation.

Were you on the road at the time? Perhaps you have dash cam footage showing either vehicle in the run up to the collision?

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 with the reference 44210024951. Alternatively, you can phone Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
