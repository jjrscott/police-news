Officers continue to appeal for CCTV following a public order incident outside of Orchard House, Orchard Lane on Monday, 29 March.

We were called shortly after 2pm to reports that a group of males were fighting with knives, bats and machetes. A dog was also seen at the scene of the incident.

One man was taken to hospital, with serious yet non-life threatening injuries.

Officers are keen to hear from anyone who may have CCTV, dash-cam or Ring Doorbell footage from the area at around that time.

Seven men have been arrested in connection with the incident:

 * A 20-year-old man from Southampton has been arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a controlled Class A drug, violent disorder and section 18 grievous bodily harm with intent.
 * A 21-year-old man, 24-year-old man, 26-year-old man and a 28-year-old man, all from Southampton, have been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder.
 * A 27-year-old man from Southampton has been arrested on suspicion of causing section 18 grievous bodily harm with intent.
 * A 28-year-old man from Southampton has been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder and using threatening/abusive/insulting words/behaviour with intent to cause fear of/provoke unlawful violence.

All seven men have been released from custody but remain under investigation while enquiries continue.
