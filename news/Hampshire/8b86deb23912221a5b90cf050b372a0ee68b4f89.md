Further to our appeal earlier this week regarding an indecent assault on a 20 year old woman in Newport High Street, we have had several people come forward with information.

We would like to thank everyone to taking the time to get in touch and want to assure you that we continue to progress our enquiries.

We will update you once we have any further information.

The assault took place at around 2.10pm on March 11.

The victim was inside a shop on the High Street when a man, described as slim and with a shaved head, has approached her and touched her inappropriately.
