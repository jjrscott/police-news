We have released a CCTV image of a man we would like to identify following an indecent exposure incident in Petersfield.

At around 3.45pm on Thursday 7 November, a 12-year-old girl was walking along The Causeway to the rear of the Tesco store when she was followed by a man she did not know.

As she walked towards Hylton Road, the man approached the girl and exposed himself to her.

The girl quickly left the area.

Officers are keen to identify the man in this CCTV image, although we appreciate it is not the clearest picture.

He is described as being:

White
Aged between 35 and 45
Slim build
Wearing black sweatshirt, dark blue trousers with a white stripe up the outside of the leg and trainers

If you recognise this man, or witnessed anything in the area of The Causeway and Hylton Road on 7 November, officers would like to hear from you.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44190400985. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
