Can you help us identify these people?

We'd like to speak to them after two men were assaulted by The Hard bus station, Portsmouth, in the early hours of June 28.

Officers have been investigating following the incident, which left both victims, a 21-year-old and a 23-year-old, with serious facial injuries.

Now they are in a position to release these CCTV images in a bid to identify the people shown, as they may have information which could help.

We know the images are quite small, and not particularly clear, but we hope that if you know them, they will be recognisable from these images.

If you think you have any information that could help please call us on 101, quoting 44190222739, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
