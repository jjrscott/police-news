Updated News Post

Three women arrested yesterday following our investigation into the death of a baby found in Portsmouth in January have been released from custody.

A 39-year-old woman, a 21-year-old woman and a 20-year-old woman, all from Portsmouth, were arrested yesterday morning (May 12) on suspicion of conspiracy to murder.

The arrests came as a result of our investigations into the discovery of the baby's body at the junction of Victoria Street and Old Commercial Road on the morning of January 25.

The women have been released from custody but remain under investigation as our enquiries continue.

Detective Chief Inspector Simon Baker said: "We know that this case was upsetting for a lot of people within the community and we want to reassure you that our officers are trained to deal with sensitive investigations such as this, which can often be very complex, and will do what is needed to get the right outcome for all those involved.

"While we know that many of you will have questions, we hope you will understand that we are not in a position to provide any further details while this investigation continues to progress. When we are in a position where we can update further, we will."
