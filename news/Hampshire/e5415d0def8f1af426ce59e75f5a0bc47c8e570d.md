We have charged a 16-year-old boy with robbery following an incident in Eastleigh town centre on Monday 10 February and last night another boy, aged 16, was arrested on suspicion robbery.

A 17-year-old boy reported he was assaulted by a group of boys on Market Street just after 4pm before having his Apple Air Pod headphones and a ring stolen.
A 16-year-old boy from Eastleigh has been charged with robbery and will appear before Southampton Youth Court today (February 12).

Last night (February 11) officers made another arrest in connection with the incident. A 16-year-old boy from Eastleigh remains in police custody at this time.

The two 15-year-old boys from Eastleigh who were arrested on suspicion of robbery have been released on police bail until March 9 to allow for further enquiries. They have conditions not to enter Eastleigh town centre in that time.

As part of this investigation, a 17-year-old boy was also charged with a public order offence and has been given conditions not to enter the town centre. He will appear before Southampton Youth Court on March 2.

We continue to appeal for witnesses and would ask anyone who saw this incident on Monday afternoon to get in contact with us. Call 101 and quote 44200052073.
