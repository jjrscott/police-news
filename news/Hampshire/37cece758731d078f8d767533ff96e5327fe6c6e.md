We are appealing for witnesses and information after a 19 year old man sustained a fractured jaw following an altercation on Fleet Road in the early hours of Sunday morning, September 15.

The victim, who is from Church Crookham, was taken to hospital where he had to undergo surgery.

He had been clubbing at Moo Moos with a group of male and female friends earlier that night but the assault occurred outside the Old Emporium on Fleet Road.

The group were waiting for a taxi when they were approached by two males, one of whom punched the victim in the face.
