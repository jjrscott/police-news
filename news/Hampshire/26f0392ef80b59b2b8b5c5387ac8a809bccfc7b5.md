We have reported seven people for summons, in relation to fixed penalty notices, for breaching the current Health Protection Regulations after it was reported a group of people in a house on Graham Road were having a party on Saturday 30 January.

Officers deployed to the address just before 10pm and found seven people inside from different households. The resident of the house told officers he was hosting a birthday party.

We reported each person for summons in relation to fixed penalty notices, which means they will each face a Â£200 fine.

Those who will receive the fine are men aged between 27 and 40-years-old and one woman, aged 24-years-old.

Chief Inspector Ricky Dhanda, said: "This was a blatant breach of the Health Protection Regulations that are in place to keep people safe during the pandemic.

"The people hosting and attending this party were putting themselves and their loved ones at risk from the virus.

"It is behaviour like this that ultimately puts pressure on the NHS and puts other people in the community at risk of serious illness or death.

"Sadly this is an example of complete disregard for the rules when so many others are sticking to the restrictions and making personal sacrifices every day.

"Our message is that anyone found to be not following the regulations will face a fixed penalty notice."
