Can you help us identify these men?

We would like to speak to them in connection with an assault at Le Tissier Court in December.

At around 5.15am on the Saturday 21 December a man went to Le Tissier Court with a small group.

At the address he had his money stolen before being assaulted.

He suffered a head injury and required hospital treatment.

Since then, officers have been trying to make enquiries and we are now turning to the public to identify two men we want to speak with in connection to this incident.

One man is described as being white, with short light blonde hair and a wide head. He is around 28-30 years old, approximately 5ft 10ins and broad shouldered.

The other is a white man with tanned skin, his hair is dark and worn longer on the top with shaved sides and back. He has an athletic build, and has a goatee, an earring, and tattoos.

Do you recognise either man in this CCTV image? We appreciate the image isn't clear.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44190457618. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 55 111.
