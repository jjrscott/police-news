Can you help us identify this woman?

We are looking to speak with her in connection with an incident that happened Tesco on Tebourba Way, Southampton, earlier this month.

At around 8.15am on Friday 15 May a man in his 40s was threatened with a knife in the store car-park.

The victim reported that the woman threatened to spit on him, and then pulled a knife from her bag and made threats to stab him.

The woman is described as being white, aged between 35 and 40-years-old. She is approximately 5ft 6ins tall, and has shoulder length blonde hair.

She was wearing a two-tone grey coat with a black top underneath, blue skinny jeans, and beige coloured high-top trainers. She also wore a bobble hat.

Do you recognise the woman in this CCTV image?
