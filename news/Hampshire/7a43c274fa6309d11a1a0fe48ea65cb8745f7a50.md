We're appealing for witnesses following a house burglary in Andover.

It happened at a house in Gabriel Walk between 9.30pm Sunday 10 November and 7.50am Monday 11 November.

The house was broken into via the patio door and a pet iguana was stolen from the vivarium in the living room.

If you have any information or have been offered an iguana for sale, please call us on 101, quoting 44190405088.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Officers would like to remind the community to try and keep their home secure by locking windows and doors and not leave items of value on show if can be helped, especially as the days are shorter and nights longer now.

For more information on how to keep your property secure go to our website.
