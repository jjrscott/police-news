A teenager has been charged in connection with the stabbing of a 17 year old boy in Farnborough.

Theo Welland, 18, of Cody Road, Farnborough, is charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent and possession of a bladed article.

He appeared before Basingstoke Magistrates Court today, (Wednesday), where he pleaded not guilty to both offences and was conditionally bailed to appear before Winchester Crown Court on July 22.

The charges relate to an incident at Pinehurst Car Park in Farnborough on the evening of June 18 in which a 17 year old received non life threatening injuries to his hand and lower back.
