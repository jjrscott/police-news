Two people accused of assisting an offender following the shooting of a teenager in Blackwater, will now face a re-trial.

Glen Johnson, 43, of no fixed abode and Samantha Binfield, 52, of Hearsey Gardens, Blackwater, had each denied one allegation of assisting an offender.

A Winchester Crown Court jury was unable to reach a verdict in relation to the allegations following a trial that concluded at Winchester Crown Court on Friday, October 25.

At a further hearing today (Thursday, October 31), it was decided that a retrial should take place at Winchester Crown Court on March 2.

At the conclusion of the two week trial, a third defendant, a 17 year old boy from Blackwater, was found not guilty of attempted murder but guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent by a majority verdict.

The 17 year old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has been remanded in custody for sentence at Bristol Crown Court on November 15.

The juvenile was accused of shooting another teenager, who is now aged 19, at a garage block in Hearsey Gardens, Blackwater, on February 10, 2018.
