We're appealing for witnesses to a robbery which took place near Kingston Cemetery in Portsmouth.

At around 6.45pm on Sunday 12 December, a man in his 40s was walking north along George Street, towards New Road, when he was approached from behind by a man with a knife.

The man demanded the victim hand over his rucksack, which contained some wireless headphones and a Samsung tablet.

He has been described as:

 * Aged between 17 and 24 years
 * 5ft 11ins tall
 * Spoke with an English accent
 * Wearing black puffer style jacket, with writing on the upper right side of the chest and with the hood up
 * Wearing dark trousers
 * Black scarf over his face

Officers would like to hear from anyone who saw a man matching this description in this area.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44190441614.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org
