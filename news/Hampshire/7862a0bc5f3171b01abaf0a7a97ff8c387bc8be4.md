A man has been jailed for 26 weeks for shoplifting from stores in Southampton.

Ian Masters, aged 31, of no fixed abode, admitted one charge of burglary other than dwelling, 11 charges of theft from a shop and one charge of possession of a class B drug namely cannabis at Southampton Magistrates' Court yesterday, 21 April.

The court heard that Masters had stolen items such as alcohol, lamb, chocolate and razors from Waitrose and Sainsburys in Portswood, Tesco Express in Bitterne and Song Oriental Chinese Supermarket between 12 February and 20 April.

Police Sergeant Chris Sharland said "Masters is a prolific offender and we hope this sentence of imprisonment gives some reassurance to victims that we take these offences seriously and will look at every option to bring offenders to justice".
