We have arrested a man in connection with a serious road traffic collision that left a motorcycle rider with life threatening injuries.

The incident happened on the A27, just prior to St Margaret's Roundabout in Titchfield at 5.50am on Tuesday 28 July.

It was reported a dark coloured vehicle was in collision with the motorcyclist before leaving the scene.

The rider of the motorcycle, a 29-year-old man from Portsmouth, suffered life threatening injuries and remains in hospital in a stable condition.

To allow us to deal with the incident, the westbound carriage way between Titchfield Gyratory and St Margaret's Roundabout was temporarily closed.

We have since arrested a 46-year-old man from Fareham on suspicion of driving whilst unfit through drugs. He has been released under investigation to allow for further enquiries to take place.

We continue to appeal to anyone who may have seen what happened.

If you were on this stretch of road in the early hours Tuesday 28 July and witnessed this incident, or have dash cam footage that may be able to assist us, please get in touch.

Call 101 and quote 44200282097.
