Drug dealer George Thomson has been jailed for his involvement in the supply of cocaine and heroin in Southampton.

The 23-year-old, from Hoddinott Road in Eastleigh, was arrested on 5 December 2019 as part of an investigation into class A drugs supply at an address in Lydgate Road.

When he was stopped by police, he was found to be carrying around £2,000 worth of class A drugs, as well as hundreds of pounds in cash.

Thomson appeared at Southampton Crown Court on 16 October where he pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply, and one count of possession of a class B drug - relating to cannabis.

Appearing at the same court on Thursday 22 October, he was jailed for 32 months.

He was also ordered to forfeit £432.30 in cash and two mobile phones.

Inspector Allan Dineley, from the Southampton High Harm Team, said: "This is an excellent result following a great piece of work by officers from the High Harm Team, and the Criminal Investigation Department who brought this investigation to court.

"Drug supply, and the associated criminality and violence, can be devastating for our communities, and we would encourage anyone with information about drugs supply in their area to get in touch with us so we can continue to develop a strong intelligence picture.

"You can call us on 101, or make reports via our website."
