A 200 metre cordon remains in place in Bordon due to the discovery of a suspect WW2 device and the public are advised restrictions are likely to be in place until after midday tomorrow.

Currently, the A325 is not affected but there are closures in place on Hogmoor Road, Firgrove Lane and Oakhanger Road.

Hogmore Inclosure remains a risk to ramblers and dog walkers so advice is keep out of the area.
