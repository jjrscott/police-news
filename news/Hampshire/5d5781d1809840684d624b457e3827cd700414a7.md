A man from Gosport has today (Monday 8 February 2021) admitted a string of serious child sex offences.

Marc Daniel Ward was charged with a number of offences dating back to October 2020 relating to one child.

The 29-year-old had sexually abused the child on multiple occasions over a two month period before police were called at the beginning of this year.

Ward, formerly of Brewers Lane in Gosport, was subsequently arrested and charged with the following:

 * 9 counts of sexual activity with a child
 * One count of engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child
 * One count of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.

Appearing at Portsmouth Crown Court today, he admitted all of the offences and was remanded in custody to appear at the same court for sentencing on 26 March.
