The family of 34 year old Marcos Martins, who died following a road traffic collision on Churchill Way West, Basingstoke, on May 19, have released the following tribute to him:

'Those who pass by us, do not go alone, and do not leave us alone; they leave a bit of themselves, and take a little of us.

'You will remain alive in the hearts of those who had the privilege of living with you. Your legacy here was one of family, friendship and love.

'Thank you for everything you did for us, we will love you beyond this life. Rest in peace wherever you are!

Psalm 91

Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High
will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.
I will say of the Lord, "He is my refuge and my fortress,
my God, in whom I trust.'

The incident took place at 5.37pm on May 19. Mr Martins' brown Honda moped was travelling Westbound on Churchill Way West when it was in collision with a grey Scania lorry, close to the Victory Roundabout.
