We're appealing for witnesses following a fatal collision on the A325 Petersfield Road near Greatham on Saturday morning.

Officers were called at 05:46am on January 2 to reports of a collision involving a Citroen van and a pedestrian on the A325 between Greatham and Whitehill.

The driver of the white Citroen Berlingo van, a man in his 40s, is believed to collided with a person in the road and left the roadside.

The pedestrian a 47-year-old man from Gosport was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers.

The van driver was taken to hospital having suffered minor injuries and later discharged.

Investigations into the exact circumstances of the collision are ongoing at this time and the road has been fully reopened.

We are keen to speak to any motorists who were driving along this stretch of the A325 or the surrounding area around the time of the incidents and may have seen anything or has dash cam footage.

We are also keen to hear from any motorists who may have been travelling along the A3 between Petersfield and Liss who have seen a man walking along the carriageway, again with any dash cam footage.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call us on 101, quoting 4421000736.
