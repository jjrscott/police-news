We are now able to name the 17-year-old who died after an incident in Thornhill, Southampton, on Sunday, January 19.

He was James Laurie, of Montague Avenue, Southampton.

James' family has been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers.

A 15-year-old boy from Andover who was arrested on suspicion of murder remains in police custody at this time.

Chief Inspector Phil Lamb said: "This is a tragic incident in which a young man has lost his life. We believe at this stage that this is an isolated incident, but we are still keen to hear from anyone who was in the Thornhill area on Sunday prior to us being called at 6.15am.

"In addition to the specially trained Family Liaison Officers who are supporting James's family, a team of detectives, specialist search officers and neighbourhood officers are working on what is a broad and fast-paced investigation.

"We will be conducting extra patrols in the area over the coming days, not only to reassure the community, but also to support the investigation and the searches that we anticipate taking place.

"I understand that the community will be both saddened and concerned by James's death, so I would again appeal for anyone who has any information to either speak to our officers, call 101 quoting Operation Tint, or leave information via our online portal https://mipp.police.uk/operation/44HC20W01-PO1.

"Alternatively, they can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
