We are aware of some posts circulating on social media in relation to alleged attempts to approach children in the Farnborough/Cove area.

The details of these incidents are:

A young boy told a friend he had been chased by a male in Caswell Close, Farnborough, at around 7pm on August 25. The allegation was reported to police by a third party. The young boy subsequently told his parents the incident had not occurred.

We received an online report about an incident at around 7.15pm on August 25 at the Co-Op in Fernhill Road, Farnborough. A young girl remained in the car while her mother went into the shop. Two suspects, described as young males, appeared to be paying interest to the boot of the car and made an attempt to get into the boot before making off. There was no suggestion that the child was approached by the suspects and there was no access gained to the vehicle.

We received a further online report regarding an incident on Bridge Road, Cove. At around 1.30pm, a young girl was cycling in Bridge Road. Two males in a silver Vauxhall Astra pulled into a layby and one of the male started walking towards the young girl. The girl's mum was just behind and ran towards her daughter. The man then got back in the car and they drove off.

We would always encourage members of the public to call police if they witness any suspicious activity, in order for us to be able to investigate the circumstances. You can contact us by reporting online at www.hampshire.police.uk or by calling 101. If there is an incident ongoing there and then, or you believe there is imminent risk of injury to a person or damage to property, ALWAYS call 999.
