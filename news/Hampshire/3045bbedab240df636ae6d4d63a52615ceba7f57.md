We are appealing for witnesses and information after two 17 year old boys were assaulted during a robbery in Farnborough.

The incident occurred on Wednesday, October 28 at around 10.30pm. A group of friends had parked in the Sulzer roundabout car park.

They were approached by four males, all described as wearing grey jogging bottoms and black coats. Three of the suspects were wearing face coverings.

The suspects have threatened the group before assaulting two of the victims.

One has also thrown an item at the windscreen of the victim's car, causing damage to the windscreen.

A blue XR iPhone was stolen along with a black leather wallet containing bank cards.

We believe this incident may be linked to a series of robberies and serious assaults on young people in the Fleet and Farnborough areas over the last few days.

Each report states a group of between four to eight young men approached young victims, assaulted them and demand they hand over valuables.

Local neighbourhood officers have increased patrols in the area. If you're concerned or have information that could help us identify those involved, please get in touch.

Maybe you were driving in the area and have dash cam footage that might help our investigation.

If you can help, call 101 quoting reference 44200419278.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or report anonymously online via Crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information.
