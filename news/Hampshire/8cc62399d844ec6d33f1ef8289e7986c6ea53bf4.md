We're appealing for witnesses after a teenage boy was robbed in Riverside Park, Southampton.

At around 3pm on Wednesday 22 July, a 14-year-old boy was walking through Riverside Park with two friends when he was approached by a group of teenagers.

One of the teenagers lifted up his top and showed the victim a machete that he was carrying in the waistband of his trousers.

A second teenager then approached the victim and took his bike and chain from around his neck before walking away.

The bike is described as a Trek 6500, silver mountain bike.

Were you in the area at the time of the incident? Did you witness anything or see anyone acting suspiciously? Has anyone tried to sell you a bike matching this description recently?

If you have any information, please call us on 101 quoting 44200275589.

Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
