Do you recognise this Go-Kart? It was found with one other Go-Kart in an abandoned trailer In Hound Green, Hook.

Police suspect both the karts and the trailer may have been stolen and are looking to trace the owners.

The trailer was found abandoned on the B3349 in the early hours of the morning on December 7 at Hounds Green.

The trailer is described as an Ifor Williams P6 E and it contained two Hangzhou Highper GK005 off road Go-Karts.

If you recognise the descriptions or you think you may know who the Karts and trailer belong to, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44190439659.
