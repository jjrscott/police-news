A man has been charged with drugs offences in Southampton

Ahmed Haji, 25, of Anglesea Terrace, Southampton, has been charged with two counts of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs namely heroin and crack cocaine and one count of acquiring / using /possessing criminal property.

It comes after officers from Southampton's High Harm team carried out a proactive stop and search of a silver Ford Fiesta Zetec and three men in Granville Street, Southampton, on Monday, 22 March, after spotting a suspected drugs deal taking place.

During the search officers located a quantity of suspected Class A drugs and cash.

This led officers to carry out a search of an address in Anglesea Terrace, Southampton, where further Class A drugs and a large quantity of cash and designer clothing were located.

Haji appeared at Southampton Magistrates Court on Wednesday, 24 March where he pleaded guilty to all three offences.

He was remanded in custody and is next due to appear at Southampton Crown Court on Thursday, 15 April for sentence.

Three other men were initially arrested in connection with this incident.

Two men aged 32 and 43, from Southampton, were arrested on suspicion of possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply. Both were questioned by officers and released under investigation while enquiries continue.

A 57-year-old man, also from Southampton, was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs and possession of a knife in a public place. He has also been questioned by officers and released under investigation while enquiries continue.
