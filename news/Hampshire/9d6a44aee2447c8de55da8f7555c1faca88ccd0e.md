Do you recognise the man in this e-fit?

Officers investigating a burglary at an address in Green Lane, Frogmore, are keen to speak with this man in connection with the incident.

Around 2.30am on Tuesday, May 5, a man entered the address, before fleeing the scene on foot after being disturbed.

Nothing has been reported as stolen in the incident.

Sergeant Martyn Evans, of the Hart district Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "This was obviously very distressing for the occupant of the house, discovering someone downstairs in the early hours of the morning.

"We completely understand the effect this has and I want to reassure the community we take reports like this extremely seriously.

"Please, if you do recognise the man in this image, then you should call 101, quoting the reference number 44200158014.

"Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
