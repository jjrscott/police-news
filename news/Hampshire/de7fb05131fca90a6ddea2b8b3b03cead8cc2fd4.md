A man who assaulted a member of the public in Basingstoke has been jailed for two years and two months.

Jordan Mvumelwano, 24, assaulted the victim with a glass beer bottle following an argument outside of The Beacon pub, at sometime between 11pm and 11.32pm on Friday May 10 2019, causing a laceration and fracture to the skull.

Portsmouth Crown Court heard how the offender, along with a group of friends, were leaving the pub when an argument ensued with the victim.

This culminated in the 38-year-old victim being knocked unconscious after a bottle was thrown, and had to undergo surgery following the incident.

Mvumelwano, of Kidlington Road, was sentenced at Portsmouth Magistrates Court on 28 May 2020 to two years and two months in jail. He was also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of Â£170.

Detective Constable Paul Sammons, said: "This unprovoked assault has left the victim with life changing injuries and the effects of what happened that evening are still felt. The sentence given to Mvumelwano reflects the seriousness of what happened.

"I would to thank the members of the public who helped the police investigation in this matter."
