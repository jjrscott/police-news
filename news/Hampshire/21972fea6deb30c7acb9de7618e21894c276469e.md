Officers responding to reports of two men acting suspiciously in the early hours of Thursday morning (17 Dec) in Hedge End have arrested a man.

The incident occurred at around 3.25am this morning (17 Dec) when officers challenged two men who were seen to be acting suspiciously on Wildern Lane. The two men were searched, along with the vehicle they were occupying, with a quantity of Class A drugs, a quantity of cash and multiple ID documents relating to people other than the occupants of the vehicle.

A 24-year-old man from Southampton was arrested on suspicion of possession with the intent to supply of a Class A drug.

He remains in custody at this time.

Throughout December, officers from our Roads Policing Unit will be carrying out checks for drink and drug drivers as part of Operation Holly. Driving while impaired can have tragic consequences and our message is simple; it's not worth the risk.
