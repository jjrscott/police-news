We are appealing for witnesses following the theft of an ATM machine in Bordon.

The incident took place between 4.37am and 5am this morning (Wednesday 3 June) at the McColl's on Pinehill Road.

A large JCB Telehandler was stolen from a nearby building development and used to cause extensive damage to the shop front and pull the ATM from the building.

The ATM was then dropped into the rear of a van and driven away.

A short while later a Ford Transit van was set on fire in Greatham, it is believed to be connected to this incident.

Did you see or hear the movement of a large telehandler or transit van in the area around this time?

Do you have CCTV or dash-cam footage that could help in our enquiries?

If you noticed anything suspicious, or have information that may help our enquiries, please phone 101 with the reference 44200197983.

Alternatively, people can let Crimestoppers know anonymously on 0800 555 111.
