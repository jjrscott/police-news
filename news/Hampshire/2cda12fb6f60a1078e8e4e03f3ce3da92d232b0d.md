Officers made an arrest after carrying out a search warrant in North Baddesley.

Romsey's Neighbourhood Policing Team carried out the search warrant at a house in Cedar Crescent today (Friday 7 February).

A 16-year-old boy from North Baddesley was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a Class B drug. He is currently in police custody.

A quantity of a suspected Class B drug was also seized.

Inspector Chris Taylor said: "The supply of drugs and the harm they can cause to vulnerable people is a priority for our officers.

"I would like to thank the local community for their support - operations such as the one today can't happen without it.

"If you have concerns about drug-related activity in your area, please don't assume that someone else will report it. Even the smallest piece of information can help us develop a clearer intelligence picture.

"Anyone with information should call us on 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
