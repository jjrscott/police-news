We are appealing for witnesses and information after three young teenagers were assaulted in Church Crookham.

The incident occurred at around 8pm on Saturday, October 31, at Peter Driver Sports Field in Bourley Road, Church Crookham.

The group of young people were inside the five a side football cage in the playing field when they were approached by approximately six to eight older boys, around 16-18 years old, who are described as wearing dark clothing and balaclavas.

One of them punched a 14 year old boy causing him to lose consciousness. He was taken to hospital for treatment but has since been discharged.

The 13 year old victim was sat inside the cage when he was approached by three of four suspects and was assaulted. He managed to run away.
After leaving Peter Driver, another 14 year old boy was approached by the suspects in Beacon Hill Road. The suspects demanded his money, bag and belt.

The victim was punched when he refused. The suspect then showed the victim a knife but the victim managed to push the suspect away and ran.

Do you live in the vicinity of Peter Driver Sports Ground, The Tweseldown Pub or Beacon Hill Road? Did you see or hear anything suspicious around this time?

Do you have private CCTV or a Ring Doorbell that may have captured something? Or maybe you were driving in the area and have dash cam footage that might help our investigation.

We believe this incident may be linked to a series of robberies and serious assaults on young people in the Fleet and Farnborough areas over the last few days.

Each report states a group of between five to eight young men approached young victims, assaulted them and demand they hand over valuables.

Local neighbourhood officers have increased patrols in the area. If you're concerned or have information that could help us identify those involved, please get in touch.

If you can help, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200423023.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or report anonymously online via Crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information.
