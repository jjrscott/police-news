Can you help? We are appealing for witnesses following an altercation in Chandler's Ford on Wednesday 14 October.

The incident occurred at 9am on Sycamore Avenue in Chandler's Ford.

A woman was removing a car seat from her vehicle, when an unknown man pulled up alongside her in a vehicle and started to verbally abuse her. The man then abandoned his vehicle in the road to follow her across the road, racially abused her and made a throat cutting hand gesture before returning to his vehicle.

The suspect is described as a white male in his 20s, approximately 5ft 6", blonde hair with a quiff. He was also wearing blue jeans - covered with paint - and a white hoody.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you witness the incident? Do you have any dash cam or CCTV footage of the incident?

Anyone with information in relation to this incident is asked to call us on 101, quoting 44200398912. Alternatively you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
