Hampshire Constabulary officers, executed a pre-planned drug warrant yesterday (22 July) in Eastleigh, seizing £80,000 in the process.

The warrant, which was executed by our officers at 8.04am yesterday morning, helped to disrupt a potential distribution and supply line of Class A drugs.

Officers searched a property on Longster Road, resulting in the seizure of £80,000 relating to suspected cultivation of drugs and money laundering offences. A cannabis plant, and a large quantity of cocaine were also seized, along with a number of mobile phones and tablet devices.

A 23-year-old man from Eastleigh was arrested at the time of the incident, but released pending further investigation.

Local neighbourhood policing teams and PCSOs will be patrolling the area, conducting house-to-house enquiries and offering reassurance to the local community.

District Commander for Eastleigh, Chief Inspector Marcus Cator, said: "We rely upon our communities to contact us and tell us when they have concerns over issues which they feel need police consideration.

"Following support from our communities, our teams are working hard to ensure we continue to target those people who persist in committing crime and bringing harm to our communities."
