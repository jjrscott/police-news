A robber who stole hundreds of pounds worth of cigarettes and cash from a shop in Sandown has been jailed for four years.

Craig Nathan Knowles, of no fixed abode, targeted the same store three times in November and December of last year, and had made off with approximately Â£700 in cash and cigarettes by the end of his spree.

On each occasion, the 35-year-old would enter Central Stores in Avenue Road before threatening staff, leaving them in fear for their safety as he made his demands.

The incidents happened on 19 November, 27 November and 16 December 2019.

On the evening of his third robbery, he was arrested by police and charged the next day, following an investigation by Isle of Wight CID.

Knowles appeared at Portsmouth Crown Court on 23 March where he pleaded guilty to all three robberies.

Today (Friday 29 May) he was sentenced to four years in prison when he appeared at Isle of Wight Crown Court.
