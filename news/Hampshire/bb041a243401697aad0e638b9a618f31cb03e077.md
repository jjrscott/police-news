Do you recognise this man?

We are looking to speak to him in connection with an incident at the Southampton v Liverpool football fixture at St Mary's on Saturday 17 August.

An item was thrown from the Northam stand away end into the Northam stand home section shortly after the second goal.

The item, described as a nitrous oxide (NOS) canister, hit a seven-year-old Southampton fan.

He suffered minor injuries.

If you recognise this man or have any other information about this incident, please call 101 quoting 44190293624.

Alternatively you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
