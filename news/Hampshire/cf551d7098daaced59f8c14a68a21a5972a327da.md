Do you recognise the man in this e-fit?

We would like to hear from anyone who recognises this man following a report of a robbery on Montgomerie Road, Southsea on Wednesday 18 November.

A man in his 20s was approached at 7.15pm by a man carrying a knife, who then demanded he hand over his property. The man stole a bottle of wine, an ID card and cash.

The victim was not injured.

The man has been described as:

 * Black
 * Aged in his late 30s
 * Dark patches/scarring on forehead
 * Unshaven

He is also described as having a dog, possibly of Staffordshire Bull Terrier breed, with him at the time.
