Can you help us identify this man?

Officers investigating a robbery in Andover have released this image of a man they would like to speak to.

The incident happened between 9.35pm and 9.45pm on Thursday 28 January in Admiral Way, Andover.

A man in his 30s was walking along Admiral Way, between the Queen Charlotte pub and the Co-op, when he was stopped by two men.

The men assaulted him and threatened him with a weapon, whilst making demands for his bank card and PIN.

The man handed over his bank card and PIN.

One of the men then went to the Co-op and withdrew cash before returning the card to the victim and running off.

The first man is described as being approximately 24-years-old, 5ft 7ins tall and stocky build. He was wearing black clothing with the hood up and a blue face mask.

The second man is described as being white, approximately 22-years-old, 5ft 9ins tall and skinny build. He was wearing a black hoodie with small white logo on the back of the neck, black trousers and white trainers with a black logo.
