At the beginning of the year, we charged a woman with breaching a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) after she persistently begged in Fareham and Gosport.

Rebecca Trudy Connelly, aged 28 years, of Gosport Road in Fareham, was prohibited from begging under the conditions of her CBO, which she was handed in November 2019 for similar offences.

She took no notice of this and was caught begging in West Street, Fareham, on 22 November.

Connelly continued to beg and was again spotted in Gosport Road, Fareham, on 24 November, Osborn Road, Fareham on 2 January this year and Gosport High Street on 4 January.

She was subsequently arrested and charged for the breaches, and appeared at Portsmouth Crown Court on Friday 7 February where she admitted the offences.

Following her court appearance, she was remanded in custody to appear at the same court on Friday 6 March, where she will be sentenced.
