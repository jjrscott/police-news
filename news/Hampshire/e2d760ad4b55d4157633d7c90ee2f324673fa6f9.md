We have released CCTV images of two men that we would like to speak to in connection with an incident in Southsea.

At 12.01am on Thursday 25 June, a 20-year-old man was punched in the face before being threatened by two men.

He was approached on Queens Crescent near to the junction with Sussex Terrace. He was then punched in the face and demands were made for him to hand over his wallet and backpack.

One of the suspects was believed to have been in possession of a knife. The suspects made off with the man's wallet and backpack down Sussex Terrace. A short while later the victim's card was used at an off-licence on Osbourne Road, Southsea.

The victim suffered bruising to the face and did not require hospital treatment.

One of the suspects was wearing a black baseball cap and a white t-shirt with tan colour shirts. The other was wearing black shorts and a white t-shirt. One of the suspects was said to be on a bike at the time of the robbery.

Do you recognise the men pictured? Were you in the area at the time of the incident? Did you see what happened?

Anyone with any information about this incident is asked to get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200230662.

Alternatively, call the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
