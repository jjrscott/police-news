We are appealing to anyone who may have information about a stolen handbag containing photos of great sentimental value to the owner.

The handbag was stolen from a black Mitsubishi Colt that had been parked in Great Copse car park in Mottisfont on the morning of November 30.

The couple had gone for a walk and on return, found a window had been smashed and the bag, described as quilted black leather, was gone. Along with the photos, a Huawai P20 mobile phone was also inside the bag.

The victim is devastated at losing the photos, which are of her four children and are irreplaceable.

If anyone finds these photos discarded or knows of their whereabouts, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200462763.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or report online at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
