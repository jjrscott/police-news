Boy arrested in connection with robbery at convenience store in Southampton

We have arrested a 15-year-old boy on suspicion of robbery following an incident at Bob and Paula Stores on Valentine Avenue yesterday (Saturday 22 February).

The incident happened just before 12.30pm.

It was reported two teenage boys entered the store, threatened staff and attempted to take money from the till.

The boys made off with cigarettes grabbed from behind the counter.

Officers deployed to the location and conducted a search of the area.

Last night a teenage boy was arrested. Today he is in custody and being questioned on suspicion of robbery.

The investigation is ongoing.

Anyone with information should call 101 and quote 44200068122.
