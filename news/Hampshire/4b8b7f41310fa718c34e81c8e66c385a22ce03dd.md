Tribute has been paid to a man who died following a collision on the A34 on Tuesday (November 19).

Oliver Washington, 19, of Billericay, Essex, died following a collision between a lorry and a pedestrian on the northbound carriageway near Kingsworthy at 4.45am.

Today his parents, Gytha and John, have paid tribute to their son.

They said: "We are devastated by the loss of our only son Oliver. He was kind, considerate and we are so proud of the young man he had become. He loved travelling and was a keen skier.

"He was really enjoying his university course and looking forward to a career in Event Management.

"Last summer he began volunteering for Cancer Research UK as part of his Gold Duke of Edinburgh award which he had recently received.

"He loved helping out at Race for Life events and was planning to help again next year. We have decided that all donations and money raised in Oliver's memory will go to CRUK."

Investigations into the exact circumstances of the collision are ongoing.
