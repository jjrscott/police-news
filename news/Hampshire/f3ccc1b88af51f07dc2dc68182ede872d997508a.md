We're appealing for any witnesses, or anyone with information, to come forward following a robbery in Southampton.

The incident occurred between 6.05 and 6.10pm on Monday 18 January behind the community centre on Olive Road. A dark Land Rover had intentionally driven into a silver Toyota causing it to collide with a post in the field.

The occupants of the Land Rover have subsequently assaulted the occupants of the Toyota and caused further damage to the vehicle.

During the altercation a number of personal items were stolen before the occupants of the Land Rover fled the scene.

We've conducted a number of initial enquiries but are now turning to the public for help.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you see what happened? Perhaps you have dash cam footage around the time of the event or have seen a damaged Land Rover in the local area?

Anyone with information in relation to this incident is asked to call 101, quoting 44210020439.

Alternatively, you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
