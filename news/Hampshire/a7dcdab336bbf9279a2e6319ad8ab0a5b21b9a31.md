Dispersal powers are in place in the area including and around Knightwood Leisure Centre and Valley Park, between November 5 and November 9.

Neighbourhood Inspector Chris Taylor authorised two separate dispersal orders on behalf of Hampshire Constabulary. They will specifically cover the area within the red boundary on the map attached.

The orders will run from 2pm on Thursday, November 5 to 6am on Saturday, November 7 - and then from 2pm on Saturday, November 7 until 6am on Monday, November 9.

If it's considered appropriate, further dispersal orders could then be put in place.

Section 35 dispersal orders give officers the power to disperse groups of people out of the areas as shown within the red boundary on the map.

Inspector Taylor said: "We will be conducting high visibility patrols in these areas to reassure the public and deal with any issues. People should also be aware that congregating in groups may also be in breach of Covid-19 legislation - which will be enforced."

Anyone who witnesses anti-social behaviour or large gatherings is encouraged to call 101, or if a crime or incident is in progress, always call 999.
