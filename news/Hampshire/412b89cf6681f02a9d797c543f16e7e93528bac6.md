We have issued crime prevention advice after catalytic converters were stolen from parked cars in Winchester.

The first incident took place outside an address in Winnall Manor Road, sometime between 7pm and 8pm on Wednesday 22 July.

It was reported that two men approached two parked cars, a Toyota Auris and a Honda Jazz, and removed the catalytic converters.

Another incident took place in Alresford Road, Winchester, between 5am and 9.30am on Thursday 23 July. A catalytic converter was stolen from a Toyota Auris car.

Thieves steal catalytic converters for the valuable metals they can contain, which are extracted and sold on. Vehicles with a higher chassis are often targeted.

We would like to remind people of the following advice to best protect your vehicle:

 * park your car in a locked garage where possible, but if this isn't an option, then park in a well-lit and well-populated area
 * if parking in a public car park, consider parking alongside other cars and facing your bonnet towards a wall, if possible
 * avoid parking half on the pavement and half on the road
 * look out for people working under cars. If you see anything suspicious, call the police
 * if your catalytic converter is 'bolted on', you can have the bolts welded shut
 * identify/etch your converter with a unique mark or serial number
 * consider using cat clamps - a cage that surrounds your catalytic converter to prevent it being unbolted
 * consider installing security lighting/CCTV on your drive or covering your parking space.

Further details on how to keep your vehicle safe can be found on our website: https://www.hampshire.police.uk/cp/crime-prevention/theft-from-a-vehicle/vehicle-safe-and-sound/

If you see something you believe to be suspicious, call 101. You can also report online via our website www.hampshire.police.uk.

If you believe a crime is in progress, always call 999.
