We are appealing for information following an assault in Basingstoke on Monday 1 July.

At about 4pm, a 15-year-old boy was assaulted by a group of teenagers in Peggs Way. The victim was taken to hospital with numerous facial injuries.

We are looking for three male suspects, described as being between 14 and 17 years old. Two suspects are described as black, one as white.

Were you in the area at the time of the attack? Did you record the incident on your phone or CCTV? We're looking for anyone with information to come forward and help us with our enquiries.

Officers have arrested a 14-year-old boy from Basingstoke on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent. He has been released on bail until 29 July.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call 101, quoting 44190227587, or contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
