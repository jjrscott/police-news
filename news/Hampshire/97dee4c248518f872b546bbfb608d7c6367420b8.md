We are appealing for witnesses and dash cam footage following a robbery at the One Stop shop in the Park Business Centre on Park Road in Southampton on November 5.

Just before 9.30pm, four men with their faces covered enter the store carrying a crow bar and a hammer.

They fought with a member of staff who subsequently suffered a serious injury to their arm.

The group have then proceeded to steal a large amount of cigarettes and cash and made off in a white Ford Fiesta.

Officers would like to hear from anyone who is the Park Business Centre on Park Road area at around this time on Tuesday 5 November, specifically any drivers with dash cam in the vicinity.

**If you saw anyone suspicious or have footage that may be able to help us, please call 101 and quote 44190397777 or Operation Clever.**

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and leave information anonymously.

We understand the affect that these crimes have on local businesses, staff and the community and we are determined to identify those responsible.

We have begun to make contact with local business owners across and working with them to ensure their premises and staff are protected and to ensure we are following up all lines of enquiry available to us.
