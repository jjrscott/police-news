Do you recognise this man?

We are looking to speak with them in connection with an assault that happened on St Mary's Road, Southampton, on the 19 November.

The victim, a 63-year-old man from Southampton, was cycling by St Mary's Supermarket at around 11.40am when he was approached and assaulted, causing him to fall from his bike into the road.

He suffered serious injuries to his leg and hip as a result of the assault.

Officers have conducted a number of enquiries and are now turning to the public for help.

He is described as a white man, aged between 30 and 35-years-old, between 5ft 10ins and 6ft tall with a proportionate build, and ginger hair. He had a tan coloured dog with him that was off the lead.

He was possibly with a woman who had a small black and white dog with her, we believe she may also be able to help us with our enquiries.

Do you recognise this man? Perhaps you are the woman on the road at the time of the assault?

Anyone with any information is asked to phone 101 with the reference 44200448136. Alternatively you can phone Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
