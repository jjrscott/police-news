Officers responding to reports of a burglary in progress at a supermarket in Hedge End have arrested a man.

The incident occurred at between 11.45pm on Sunday 15 November and 12.15am on Monday 16 November at Tesco Express on St. Luke's Close, Hedge End.

Three men entered the premises and stole three till safes containing a quantity of cash.

A 31-year-old man from Southampton has been arrested on suspicion of burglary in connection with this incident. He has also been arrested on suspicion of burglary for three other burglary incidents in the area - including a further incident at St. Luke's Close, and incidents in Whitchurch and Spring Road.

He was later released under investigation for all four offences - pending further police enquiries.
