Officers investigating the death of a cyclist in Droxford last night (August 10) are appealing to identify the man.

Police and the ambulance service were called around 11pm last night to reports of a cyclist lying in the road on the B2150, close to the junction of Station Road.

Sadly, the cyclist was pronounced dead at the scene and we have so far been unable to identify him.

He is described as being white, of slim build and is believed to be between 50 and 60 years old.

He had on a blue shirt, khaki shorts and brown sandals.

We also have a picture of his bicycle, which we hope someone will recognise.

Officers investigating are working to identify the man, they are also keen to speak with anyone with information about the incident.

Inspector Andy Tester, from Havant Roads Policing Unit, said: ""We continue to investigate the circumstances of the crash and are appealing to anyone who may have witnessed a collision, seen the cyclist before the incident or who may have dash cam footage from the area around 11pm last night."

Anyone with information, or who may be able to assist identifying the man, can call 101, quoting Operation Heron or the reference 44200303926.
