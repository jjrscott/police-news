We're investigating an attempted robbery in Gosport at about 1.30am on Saturday (6 July).

A 27-year-old man was cycling over the Millennium Bridge towards the Explosion Museum when he was approached by a youth who demanded his money and his phone.

The suspect punched the victim in the face when he refused. Two more youths came out from bushes, one carrying a knife, and approached the victim. The victim managed to cycle away.

All three youths were described as white and about 15-19-years-old.

Additionally, one of the youths was skinny, with short-blond hair and was wearing a white t-shirt and dark shorts, another was described as medium-build, short brown hair and was wearing a blue/black top and blue jeans.

We'd like to hear from anyone who has information. Please call 101 quoting 44190233842.
