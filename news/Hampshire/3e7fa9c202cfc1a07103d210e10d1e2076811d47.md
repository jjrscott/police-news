We are appealing for witnesses and information after a man was assaulted and robbed along the A32 on Friday 13 October.

The incident occurred between 9.45am and 9.55am on a footpath alongside the A32 at the Junction of Redlands Lane and Gosport Road.

The victim - a 49-year-old man from Fareham - was cycling along the footpath and stopped to allow two pedestrians to pass by him. He was then assaulted by the two suspects - causing serious injuries - who demanded his phone and stole his shopping.

He suffered serious injuries to his face including a broken eye-socket and cheek bone as a result.

The two suspects are described as white men, in their early 20s, approximately 5ft 7" - 6ft, of medium build and wearing dark clothing with face coverings.

Officers investigating have made a number of enquiries and are now asking for your help.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you see what happened? Or perhaps you have dash-cam footage which may help the investigation.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101, quoting 44200439889.

Alternatively you can contact Independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
