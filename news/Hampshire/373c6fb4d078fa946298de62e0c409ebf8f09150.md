Can you help us identify these men?

We want to speak with them in connection with an incident of shoplifting at Tesco's in Caird Avenue, New Milton, which happened between 5.50pm and 6pm on 29 January.

The two men entered the store, removed a number of bottles of Hennesey whiskey from the shelves and left without paying.

Do you recognise either of the two men? Were you in the area at the time? We hope that someone may know who they are and be able to assist our enquiries.

Anyone with information about this incident should call 101, quoting 44210051421.

Alternatively, you can call independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
