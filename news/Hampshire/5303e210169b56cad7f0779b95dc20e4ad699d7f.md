We have issued images of four men we would like to speak to in connection with a robbery in Hordle at about 6.10pm on Thursday 27 February.

A 47-year-old woman and 54-year-old man in a vehicle parked in Stopples Lane were approached by a group of five men with their heads and faces covered.

The woman was assaulted and both her watch and the man's watch were taken along with other personal items.

The men were seen to get in to a silver Honda Civic with the registration CE08 UAA.

We appreciate the photos are grainy, but do you recognise any of these four men or their clothing? We don't have an image of the fifth man.

Did you see the car that night? It was driven away at speed, without its lights on, and turned right from Stopples Lane on to Ashley Lane.

It then travelled on Silver Street towards Lymington and then on the B3054.

If you have dash cam footage of this car, have seen it since or have any other information about this incident, please call 101 quoting 44200075102.

Alternatively, you can call the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
