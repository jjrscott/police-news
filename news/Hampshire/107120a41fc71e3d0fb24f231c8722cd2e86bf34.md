We're appealing for witnesses following a serious collision on the M3 today.

Officers were called just after 11am to reports of a single vehicle collision between junction 12 and 11 on the northbound carriageway.

The vehicle, a grey Vauxhall Astra, had collided with a tree at the side of the motorway.

The driver of the car, a 34-year-old man, from Southampton, suffered serious injuries and was taken to Southampton General hospital. His condition is described as serious, with life-threatening injuries.

The closures have now been lifted.

Investigations into the exact cause of the collision are ongoing and anyone who was driving along that stretch of the M3 at the time of the incident is asked to get in touch.

Call us on 101, quoting 44200128634.
