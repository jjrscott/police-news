We are appealing for information on the whereabouts of two bronze statues that were stolen from a home in Rockbourne on Thursday 17 October.

The statues were taken from the garden and front porch of a home between 10.55am and 2.30pm whilst the owners were out.

The statues are very distinctive. The first is a life-sized bronze statue of a running fox, 107cm x 38cm signed 'Polly Rome,' the name of the sculptress.

The second is a bronze statue of a woman with her hands in the air, exactly 1 metre tall, by the same artist.

The woman was taken from the garden, the fox was taken from an unlocked porch.

We're appealing for information to locate these statues, specifically appealing to auction houses, pawn shops or anyone who deals in bronze.

We would like to remind anyone with similar garden art or high value outdoor furniture to ensure they are cemented or anchored to the ground to keep them safe.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 and quote 44190372123.
