A 55-year-old Totton man has been given a 12 month community order after admitting to outraging public decency in a Totton park in July.

Howard Michael Beck, of Rushington Avenue, pleaded guilty at Southampton Magistrates Court yesterday (15 October) to committing an indecent sexual act in a public place on Monday 13 July.

The court heard how Beck was sat on a park bench at 6pm on 13 July, watching a yoga class taking place in a gym when he exposed himself and began masturbating.

Beck was also handed a six-month Alcohol Treatment Order, ordered to serve 20 Reasoning and Rehabilitation 6 month days and pay a £50 fine. He was also ordered to pay £85 in court costs and a £95 victim surcharge.
