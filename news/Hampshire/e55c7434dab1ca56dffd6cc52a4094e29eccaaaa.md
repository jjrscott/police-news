We realise the photos are not of the best quality but you might recognise any of these three people by what they are wearing?

We would like to speak to them in connection with an altercation with another group of young people at around 2.20am on the morning of July 14 in Lower Church Street, Basingstoke.

During the altercation, a 20 year old man fell to the ground where he was kicked and had his head stamped on, resulting in concussion and facial injuries that required hospital treatment. He also sustained a torn shoulder ligament.

Do you recognise the people in the CCTV image? The male with his back to the camera is described as being white, with short brown hair and wearing a dark navy knitted sweater or cardigan.

If you can help, please call 101, quoting reference 44190245400. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
