## Kelly Case (pictured right)

We are now in a position to release the name of the woman who was murdered in Gosport this week.

Kelly Case, aged 27, of Grange Crescent, Gosport was found by firefighters after a fire at her home on Tuesday 30 July.

Today Kelly's family have released a photograph (Kelly is pictured in orange on the right) and the following tribute:

"Kelly was lively and vibrant and we've lost our best friend.

"She was a daughter, mother, sister and auntie and we are thinking of her.

"Please respect our privacy at this difficult time."

Two further people have been arrested on suspicion of murder - a 28-year-old man from Gosport and a 32-year-old man from Gosport.

Earlier this week, a 26-year-old man of no fixed abode and a 28-year-old man from Gosport were arrested on suspicion of murder.

All four men remain in custody.

Detective Chief Inspector Phil Scrase said:

"As our investigation develops, we are still seeking as much information from the public as possible.

"Perhaps you were in the area of Grange Crescent early on Tuesday morning and saw someone acting suspiciously.

"If you have any information that can help our investigation, please call us on 101 quoting 44190267652.

"Alternatively you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

"There will be an ongoing police presence in the Gosport area - we thank local residents for their continued patience."
