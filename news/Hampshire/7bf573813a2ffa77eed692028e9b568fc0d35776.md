Six people have been arrested today, (Tuesday, June 16), in connection with the murder of Frazer Brabant, who died in January of this year - three months after he was seriously assaulted in Basingstoke.

All six were arrested following warrants carried out this morning at five addresses in Basingstoke.

They are:

* A 55 year old woman arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice and conspiracy to commit murder

* A 32 year old man re-arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder

* A 57 year old man arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder

* A 22 year old woman arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder and supplying Class B controlled substances

* A 39 year old man arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder

* A 37 year old man arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder

They currently remain in custody.

Five people were arrested back in November 2019 on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. The five are two men in their thirties from Basingstoke and three men in their twenties - two from Basingstoke and one from Middlesex. They remain under investigation.

The arrests follow the assault on 34 year old Frazer Brabant in Gershwin Road, on October 31, 2019. Officers attended and found the victim in a rear garden of a residential property in Gershwin Road with serious head injuries.

Frazer never left hospital and died on January 21, 2020.
