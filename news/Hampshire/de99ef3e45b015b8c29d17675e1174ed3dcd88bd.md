We are appealing for witnesses and information after two robberies occurred in Oakridge, Basingstoke.

The first incident happened between 9.15pm and 9.30pm on Sunday, August 18. The victim was walking on a footpath that leads from Sutton Road to Queen Mary Avenue, behind Vyne School playing fields.

He is approached by three males who demand he hand over his valuables. They then make off with a small amount of cash.

The second incident occurred at around 9.50pm on Vyne Road, at the junction with Weale Court. The victim, a 19 year old man from Basingstoke, was approached from behind. They produced a knife before making off with his rucksack and a small amount of cash.

The three suspects for both incidents are described as two black males and one white male, all aged between 16 and 18 years old.

Did you see anyone in the vicinity at that time acting suspiciously? Do you know the identity of the three males?

If you can help, please call 101, quoting reference 44190293295. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

An 18 year old man from Basingstoke has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and released on conditional bail.
