Seven knives have been taken off the streets after being placed anonymously in the knife bin at Southampton Central Police Station last week (14-20 September).

Inspector Clive Marsh from Southampton's High Harm team said: "Every knife recovered is potentially a life saved.

"The risks and consequences of carrying knives can be devastating, not only to victims of knife crime and their family and friends but also to the community in general.

"We continue to work with our partners and charities such as Fearless.org and Crimestoppers to get knives and weapons off our streets.

"We would encourage anyone who is concerned about someone carrying a knife, or scared they might get hurt, to please let us know. You can do this by calling 101 or Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.

"If you are a young person concerned about someone carrying a knife, you can tell us without having to say who you are, by reporting anonymously online at Fearless.org.

"If you are a parent, teacher or other professional who would like to find out more on how to talk to young people about knife crime, please go to the Safe for Me website at www.safe4me.co.uk."
