We are appealing for witnesses following an incident involving a motorcyclist near Winchester.

It took place at around 7am on Sunday 12 July, at the Percy Hobbs roundabout by the A31 Alresford Road.

The 65-year-old motorcyclist came off his white BMW motorbike on the roundabout and sustained life-threatening injuries.

He was taken to hospital for treatment.

He had been riding with two other motorcyclists at the time of the incident.

We would like to establish the circumstances of what happened.

Did you see what happened? Do you have dashcam footage of the incident? Perhaps you saw the three motorcyclists prior to the collision?

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44200257223.
