Can you help us identify this man?

We would like to speak to him in connection with an incident that took place in Southampton.

It was reported to us that at around 5.20pm on Wednesday 12 February, a woman was subjected to racist verbal abuse in front of her young child.

This took place at a bus stop on Canute Road, Ocean Village.

We would like to speak to the man pictured as part of our enquiries.

If you know him, or this is you, please call us on 101, quoting 44200055381.
