We're appealing for witnesses after a motorcyclist was robbed while waiting at traffic lights in Fareham.

We were called following the robbery which happened at around 4.15pm on Wednesday, August 7.

The 35-year-old motorcyclist was waiting at traffic lights on the A32 Gosport Road, heading towards Gosport, by Salterns Lane.

A man came up behind him and cut the strap of his bumbag and ran off down Salterns Lane.

The man is described as being white, approximately 5ft 10ins tall, of a skinny build and aged in his 30s. He was wearing a white t-shirt, dark trousers and a blue baseball cap.

The Oxford waterproof black bumbag contained cash, a wallet, a bottle of Hugo Boss aftershave and two rings, a silver and gold large skull ring and a bespoke Odin ring with three triangles linked together.

PC Jamie Presswell said: "This is an unusual incident and we are keen to speak to anyone who saw what happened.

"The drivers sat in the cars behind the motorbike in the traffic may have got a good view of what happened, so if this was you, please give us a call. You may have even caught it on your dash cam.

"We'd also like to hear from anyone who saw the man running through the area that afternoon or who has been offered any rings for sale."

Anyone with information is asked to call us on 101, quoting 44190278926, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
