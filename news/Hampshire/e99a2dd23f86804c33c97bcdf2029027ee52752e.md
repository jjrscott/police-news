Hampshire Constabulary's Major Crime Team has presented a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) following an investigation into the death of Sagar Bhatti.

We were called at 5.44am on Sunday 10 March to a report of two vehicles colliding with a pedestrian on Woodside Avenue. The pedestrian, 23-year-old Sagar Bhatti, was pronounced dead at the scene.

Two men, aged 26 and 29 from Eastleigh, were arrested on suspicion of murder.

Both men were interviewed by police and released from police custody pending further enquiries.

The CPS has since advised the investigation team that no further action should be taken against the men.
