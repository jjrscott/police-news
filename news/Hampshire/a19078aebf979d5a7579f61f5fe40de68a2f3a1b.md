We're appealing for witnesses following two serious assaults that took place in Southampton on Tuesday, 6 October.

The first incident happened in Shirley Precinct at around 3.40pm. An altercation took place between three people which resulted in a 22-year-old man sustaining a knife wound to his back.

The 22-year-old was taken to hospital and has since been discharged with non-life threatening injuries.

The second incident took place between 6pm and 6.15pm close to Lidl on Shirley High Street where a 19-year-old man received a knife wound to the back of his shoulder.

The 19-year-old was taken to hospital for treatment and has since been discharged with non-life threatening injuries.

A 17-year-old boy from Southampton has been arrested on suspicion of two GBH offences. He was questioned by officers and then released under investigation to allow for further enquiries to continue.

Officers believe that the people involved in both incidents are known to one another and there is no wider risk to the public.

We would like to hear from anyone who witnessed either incident or has any information that could help our investigation. Did you see what happened? Maybe you were driving in the area at the time and have dash-cam footage? Do you know any of the people who may have been involved?

Anyone with information should call 101 quoting 44200387640.

Alternatively people can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
