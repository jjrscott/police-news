We are appealing for witnesses after a road traffic collision between a bicycle and a car at the junction of Derby Road and Grange Road, North End, on Saturday 19 December.

Shortly after 9.55pm an unknown vehicle drove along Derby Road and then turned left onto Grange Road against a one way system, breaching a no entry sign.

The vehicle then collided with a cyclist and drove away.

The cyclist, a 26-year-old woman, sustained minor injuries.

We are keen to hear from anyone who saw what happened or has any further information.

Were you driving along this road? Did you see the collision, or did you see the vehicle or the bike before or after the collision took place?

Perhaps you have dashcam footage that may help our enquiries?

Anyone with information should call us on 101, quoting the reference number 44200489030.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
