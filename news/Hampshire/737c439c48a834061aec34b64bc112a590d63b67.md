We're making an appeal after two sheep were attacked by a dog in Michelmersh near Romsey.

The incident took place around 11.30am on Monday 6 January.

Two women were seen walking in a field when a dog they were walking chased sheep and pulled down two of them.

The dog, described as a mongrel/terrier type, was caught by the farmer. The sheep were not seriously injured.

One woman was described as being aged in their early 40s and the other in her late 50s.

PC Steve Rogerson, of Hampshire Constabulary's Country Watch team, said: "On this occasion, there were no serious injuries, but had the farmer not intervened it could have been much worse.

"Our advice to dog owners is to keep your dog on a lead when in or near a field with livestock.

"Ultimately, if you are not confident that your dog will return promptly on command, then it should not be off the lead.

"We have not been able to identify the owner of the dog through our enquiries to ensure that this does not happen again. If this was you, please come forward.

"If anyone has any information that could help us, please call 101, quoting the crime reference number 44200017454."
