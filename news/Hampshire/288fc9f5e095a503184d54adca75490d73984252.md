The family of a man who died following a single-vehicle collision on Saturday 30 May today paid tribute to him.

Police were called at 6.10am after a grey Nissan Leaf was involved in a collision on the B2177 Winchester Road, Upham.

Despite best efforts, Phillip Hindmarsh, 62, of Bishopstoke, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

Phillip's family have today paid tribute to him, describing him as a devoted father, loving husband and son.

They said: "Phillip, a man that simply cannot be captured in words, an enormous loss to so many whose hearts he touched.

"He was 'Big Phil' to some, 'The Cat Man' to many but to us he was just simply Daddy Bear.

"The whole in our hearts will never be filled but the legacy you leave will never be forgotten.

"The man who had all the time in the world yet still managed to be late for everything. Never too busy to stop, talk, and listen to anyone and everyone, offering kind words and advice to those in need.

"An inspiration, a legend, one in a billion."

Officers are investigating the exact circumstances of the collision and are keen to hear from anyone they have not spoken with who may have information.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200192554. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
