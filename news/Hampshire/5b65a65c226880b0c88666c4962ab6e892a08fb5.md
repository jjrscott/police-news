We are appealing for information following a burglary in Havant last week.

At around 10.30pm on Thursday October 31, two masked men forced entry to a house in Soberton Road, Havant.

The occupants, two men aged 53 and 20, were simultaneously woken to see the men standing over their beds.

Both the occupants were subsequently assaulted, with the 53-year-old man suffering injuries to his mouth and the 20-year-old man suffering bruising and swelling.

Both the victims were taken to hospital.

Nothing was taken during the burglary.

One of the burglars was described as being 6ft 1ins tall, muscular and wearing a black hooded top and balaclava.

The other was described as being 6ft 1ins tall, stocky, and wearing a black hooded top and Halloween-style mask which had black eyes, black eyelashes and fake blood coming from the mouth of the mask.

PC Harry Randell said: "This has understandably caused the victims some distress and we are keen to identify these two men.

"We want to hear from anyone who was in the Soberton Road area at this time.

"If you saw anyone acting suspiciously or someone wearing the distinctive mask described by the victims, then please get in contact with us."

Anyone with information should call 101, quoting 44190391423.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
