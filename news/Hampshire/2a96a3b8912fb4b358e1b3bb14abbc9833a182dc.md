The family of a man who died following a single-vehicle collision on the Fawley Bypass on Sunday (April 26) today paid tribute to him.

Police were called at 8.36pm after a maroon Vauxhall Astra was involved in a collision on the B3053.

Despite best efforts, Gareth Carter, 40, of West Common, Langley, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

The Royal Engineers Staff Sergeant's family have today paid tribute to him.

They said: "Gareth was a much-loved son, brother and friend to anyone in need - his kindness knew no limits, neither his passion for helping others.

"After emigrating from South Africa in 2008, he excelled in the UK Armed Forces as a Royal Engineer, achieving the rank of Staff Sergeant and only recently left the military to pursue a career in the construction industry.

"He will be sorely missed by his immediate family in the UK, extended family in South Africa, Australia and Namibia - as well as the countless people around the world whose lives he touched.

"Gareth lived life to the fullest and he dreamed bigger than anyone - he will always be remembered for his kind, loving nature and free spirit."

Officers are investigating the exact circumstances of the collision and are keen to hear from anyone they have not spoken with who may have information.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200147495. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
