Officers are investigating after receiving a report of a serious sexual assault against a 29-year-old man that happened in East Park in the early hours of Sunday morning.

The man has reported he was assaulted in East Park, near the entrance to the park at the very top of Above Bar Street, between 2.54am and 7.49am on Sunday 27 October.

Officers set up a cordon today (October 28) in East Park to carry out initial enquiries. This has since been closed down.

The man is being supported by specialist officers.

We would like to hear from anyone who was in the area of East Park on Sunday morning, perhaps after a night out, who saw or heard anything suspicious between these times.

Please call 101 and quote 44190385107.
