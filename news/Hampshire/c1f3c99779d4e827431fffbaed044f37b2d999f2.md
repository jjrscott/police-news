Officers investigating reports of a burglary in Sway have arrested a man in connection.

The incident occurred at around 1.10pm on Tuesday 16 March at a Co-Operative store on Station Road, Sway.

A man entered the store and proceeded to place a number of items into a bag - namely bottles of alcohol - and proceeded to a self-serve check out. Staff members in the store challenged the man as he attempted to leave the store without paying for a number of those items. In doing so, a confrontation occurred and the staff members were threatened with violence as they attempted to stop him from leaving the store.

The man then walked out the store.

A 23-year-old man from Sway was subsequently arrested on suspicion of one count of assault, one count of robbery and one count of causing criminal damage.

He remains in custody at this time.
