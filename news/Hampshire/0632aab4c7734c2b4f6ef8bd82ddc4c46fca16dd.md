We are appealing for witnesses or information following a burglary at a farm premises in Stoke.

The burglary occurred at around 3am in the early hours of Monday, June 30 at the farm in Stoke Lane, Stoke.

The suspects rammed a gate to gain entry to a field, then entered an outbuilding from which they stole a rough terrain vehicle and three ride-on lawnmowers.

Two of the stolen items have been recovered, the rough terrain vehicle and a lawnmower but the other two, a Hayter ride-on mower and a Efco ride-on mower, remain outstanding.

The recovered goods were found on a track beside a railway line in Whitchurch, along with a trailer stolen from another burglary in Windmill Hill, Andover, on the same night.

If you have any information about these crimes, or have been offered ride-on lawnmowers in suspicious circumstances, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200238519.

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
