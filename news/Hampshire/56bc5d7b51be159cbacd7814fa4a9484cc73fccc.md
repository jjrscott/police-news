Do you recognise this man?

We know the picture is not the best quality, but we're hoping someone can help us identify him, or has seen this man in their local area.

We want to speak to him as part of a fraud investigation in Basingstoke.

It's been reported that a man pretending to be a police officer from 'the Fraud Squad' has called one of the victims on the phone on Monday 25 November, and convinced her to withdraw money from her bank account.

A man has then attended the victim's address and collected this money.

In a similar incident, a man in his 80s was called on the 27 November, also by a person purporting to be from the Fraud Squad, but no money was taken during this incident.

Anyone who recognises the man in the image is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44190426383.

Alternatively you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org

We are asking members of the public to remain vigilant with regards to suspicious phone calls and visitors to your address.

If someone contacts you claiming to be from the police, get their details, terminate the call and then dial 101 to make contact with their stated Force and check their identity.

Similarly, if someone knocks at your front door claiming to be from the police or any other company in suspicious circumstances, first check their ID. If you're not happy, don't let them in.

Never call the phone number on their ID card to check them out. Ask the person to wait outside, shut the door and find the company number on the internet, or call 101 if they purport to be from the police. If they're genuine, they'll understand.
