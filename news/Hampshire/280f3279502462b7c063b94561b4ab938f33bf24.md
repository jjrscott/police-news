We are issuing a scam warning to residents in the Petersfield and East Hampshire area after a number of reports people being asked to hand over money to a courier by a person claiming to be a police officer.

The callers have been telephoning their victims, telling them they are an officer and are investigating a fraud.

They then ask the person to go to their bank and withdraw money, which should be handed over to a courier who will visit them.

Each time, the victims are told not to trust their bank when anti-fraud checks are being completed.

So far, we have received NINE reports, which took place between January 6 and 16. Two of the victims handed over around £6,000 each to a courier. In the other seven instances, offences were identified before the attendance of the courier.

Enquiries are ongoing and we would like to remind people to be on guard when it comes to fraudsters and remember the following advice.

• Police officers will never call people in this way and ask you to withdraw money or disclose personal or financial information. If someone does do this, please hang up - it will be a scam.

• Consider contacting your telephone provider to get a free call-blocking service if you are getting unsolicited calls.

• If you are a friend, relative or carer of someone you think might be vulnerable to this type of scam, please speak to them about this advice. You might be the only person who can stop them from being scammed.

If you or someone you know has been a victim of fraud, report it to us by calling 101. If a crime is in progress, dial 999.

You can make yourself aware of this type of scam and how to protect yourself by visiting the Action Fraud website (https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/) or by calling them on 0300 123 2040.
