We are appealing for witnesses following a robbery attempt in Basingstoke.

At around 2.30am on Saturday 30 May, a man in his 20s was walking along Worting Road when he was approached by three men he did not know.

The victim was then threatened with a knife by one of the men, who also tried to steal his rucksack, but he was able to get away unharmed. Nothing was stolen in the process.

One of the men was described as white, skinny, aged in his 30s, around 5ft 10ins tall, and wearing dark jeans, black shoes and a black Adidas hoody with 3 light coloured stripes down the arms and a large Adidas Original Logo on the back.

A second man was described as stocky, around 5ft 10ins tall and wearing a grey hoody.

The third man was described as white, around 5ft 8ins tall, and wearing a dark hoody.

We would like to hear from anyone that has any information about this incident, or saw three people matching these descriptions in the area/

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44200192493.
