Officers responding to a disturbance at a property in Chandler's Ford have charged a man.

The charges come after a public order offence was committed, and two police officers assaulted during the arrest process at an address in Chandler's Ford at 11.16pm on Tuesday 20 October.

Sam Ryan Hills, aged 29, of no fixed abode was charged with two counts of assaulting an emergency service worker, one count of committing a public order offence and one count of causing criminal damage.

Hills appeared at Southampton Magistrates Court yesterday (22 October) where he was remanded in prison until his trial, which is due to take place on 12 March 2021.
