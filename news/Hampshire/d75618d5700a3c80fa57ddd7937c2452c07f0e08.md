Officers investigating the murder of Louise Smith in Leigh Park have re-arrested a woman.

Louise, aged 16, was reported missing on Friday 8 May, before her body was found in Havant Thicket on Thursday 21 May.

A 29-year-old woman, who was initially arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, was yesterday (17 July) re-arrested on suspicion of murder.

She has been bailed until 31 July while our enquiries continue.

Officers previously charged Shane Lee Mays, aged 29 years and from Somborne Drive in Havant, with murder. His trial is due to take place at Winchester Crown Court on 10 November.

We appreciate that this case has been very distressing for the local community, however we ask you not to speculate on the circumstances surrounding Louise's death or this arrest, as this can have an impact on proceedings later down the line when evidence is presented to a jury.
