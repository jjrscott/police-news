Do you recognise this vehicle?

We have released CCTV images following a suspicious incident at an address in the Stockbridge area.

It took place at around 1.30am on Sunday 3 May.

A dark coloured 4x4, thought to be a pre-2006/07 Nissan X-Trail, was driven up to the address.

Four men were seen inside the vehicle and the car's number plates were obscured. The car left suddenly when a light was turned on in the house.

An investigation is underway and officers have released CCTV images of the vehicle as part of their enquiries.

The vehicle has been described as having a tow bar and a very loud exhaust.

Detective Constable Tom Bailey said: "This is a concerning incident and we are treating it as an attempted burglary.

"We are following several lines of enquiry and we are keen to hear from anyone who was in the Stockbridge area that night.

"Do you remember seeing a dark-coloured 4x4 vehicle?

"Or perhaps you have seen a similar vehicle in suspicious circumstances in another area?

"Any information you give could help our enquiries."

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44200158764.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
