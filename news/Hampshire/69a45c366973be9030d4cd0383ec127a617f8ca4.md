Can you help us reunite Lulu and Dolly with their owners? The friendly nanny goats, who are mother and daughter, were stolen from a barn in Lee.

The pair were stolen along with another seven goats overnight between 5.35pm on May 18 and 8am on May 19 from the barn premises in Lee, near Romsey, in the Test Valley area.

Seven of the goats were later recovered after being found wandering in the road in Nursling but the two females, one of whom is possibly pregnant, are still missing. The incident is being investigated by Hampshire Constabulary's specialist Country Watch team.

If you have any information about this crime, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200177169.

Alternatively, ring Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

The photo of Lulu and Dolly together was taken six months ago so the daughter will be bigger than pictured.
