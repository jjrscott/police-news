The family of a man who sadly died following a collision Woodside Road have today paid tribute to him.

Guntis Beitans, 30, of Selsdon Road in London, was riding a Suzuki motorcycle before it was in the collision just after midday on Saturday 17 October.

Sadly, despite best efforts of the emergency services he was pronounced dead at the scene.

Guntis' family have today paid tribute to him. They said: "There are no words to describe how saddened we are by the tragic death of Guntis.

"He was one of those rare individuals who was always happy and smiling no matter what difficulties he was going through.

"We will all miss him very much. Life is incomplete without him but he will always live in our hearts. May his soul rest in peace."

We are investigating the exact circumstances of the collision, and continue to appeal for any information or footage that could help.

Were you in the area at the time? Perhaps you saw a black motorcycle in the run up to the collision?

Anyone with information, or dash-cam footage, is asked to contact police on 101, quoting Operation Sip.
