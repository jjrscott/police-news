We are appealing for your help to identify the man in this image, as we would like to speak with him in connection with a burglary at a residential property in Lymington.

The incident, which occurred between 2.20am and 2.40am on Tuesday 10 November at a property on Solent Avenue, resulted in a wooden garage door being forced open and an outboard motor for a boat stolen.

Do you recognise this man? Or perhaps you have been offered an outboard motor for sale?

Anyone with information is asked to contact us calling 101, quoting 44200435395. Alternatively, you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
