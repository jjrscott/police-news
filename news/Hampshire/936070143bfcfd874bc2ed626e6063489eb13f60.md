We are appealing for witnesses after a man exposed himself to a woman on Southsea seafront.

The incident took place at 8pm on Saturday 25 April, whereby a man was indecently touching himself. He then exposed himself to a woman, and likely others, as they walked past him on the seafront.

We have today released an image of a man that we would like to speak with in connection with this incident.

Do you recognise him? Were you in the area at the time?

Anyone with any information about this incident is asked to get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200146801.

Alternatively, call the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
