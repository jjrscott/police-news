Hampshire Constabulary attended Woolston Trade and Labour club after it was found to have breached coronavirus restrictions on Friday 18 December.

Officers attended the club and a number of people were found mixing indoors which is in contravention with coronavirus legislation and breaches the health restrictions in place in a Tier 2 area. A Â£1000 fixed penalty notice will be issued to the club for hosting a party of more than 30 people.

PC Mark Hawley, Force Licensing Team said: "It is very disappointing that a licensed premises has been in breach of the clear guidelines around hospitality that are designed to keep everyone safe.

"We understand that people have missed out on socialising, being with people they love and care about and celebrating this festive period, but this demonstrated a clear disregard for the restrictions in place that are there protect the whole community during this difficult time."
