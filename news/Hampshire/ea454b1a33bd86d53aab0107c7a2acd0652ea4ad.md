We are appealing for witnesses after a fire caused damage to three properties on Holcroft Road, Southampton.

The incident happened between 4.15 and 4.30am on Friday 26 June.

The fire is believed to have started on a cut-way at the rear of Holcroft Road, causing damage to the fence and shed of one address before spreading to the fences of two neighbouring properties.

No one was injured in the incident.

Officers investigating are keen to hear from anyone who saw anything suspicious, or may have CCTV footage that could help in our enquiries.

We are particularly interested in identifying a man who was seen in the area of Vaughn Close having walked from the direction of Holcroft Road around the time the fire was set.

He is described as white, aged between 25 and 30-years-old, around 5ft 10ins tall, with black hair and a black beard.

He also was described as wearing a grey t-shirt with light blue shorts.

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101, and quote the reference 44200232595.

Alternatively, you can phone CrimeStoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
