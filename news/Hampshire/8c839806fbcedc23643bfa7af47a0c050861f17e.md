Do you recognise this man?

Officers have released a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to following an assault on a shop assistant in Shirley.

The incident happened in Poundland on Shirley Road at around 1pm on, Monday 16 December.

A man entered the store and became aggressive towards another customer.

Two members of staff approached the man and asked him to leave.

The man head-butted one member of staff, causing no injuries.

He then punched the other member of staff to the face, causing her to fall into a shelving wrack. She was left with swelling around her eye and bruising to her wrist.

The man in the image is described as white, aged between 60 and 70-years-old, six-foot tall, of medium build and balding with longer hair at the side which was brushed over.

At the time he was wearing a long black coat, black trousers and black shoes. He was also wearing glasses and a hearing aid to the left side of this head.

If you know or recognise him or have any information that could help us identify him please call 101 quoting 44190451229.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
