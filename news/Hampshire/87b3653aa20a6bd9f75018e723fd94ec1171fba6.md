Do you recognise the man in this E-fit?

We want to speak to him in connection with an aggravated burglary in Cosham.

It took place around 8.45pm on Sunday 22 September at a house in Hawthorn Crescent.

A man called at the house, claiming to have items for sale. He then entered the house, followed by two other men.

The three men threatened a 75-year-old man and 59-year-old woman inside before running from the house, having taken a watch.

Two of the men were described as:

• White
• Around 5ft 6ins to 5ft 8ins tall
• Between 25 and 33 years of age
• Slim build
• Wearing dark coloured jackets and baseball caps

We are keen to speak with anyone with information about this incident, but would also like to identify the man in the E-fit.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44190339133.

Alternatively you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
