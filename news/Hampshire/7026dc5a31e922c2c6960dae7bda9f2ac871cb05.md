We're appealing for witnesses following a robbery at a store in Warblington last week.

We were called after cash was stolen from the One Stop store in Emsworth Road, at around 9.50pm, on July 14.

A man, who was carrying a hammer and had his face covered, jumped over the counter, stole the contents from the till and fled the store.

It is believed he then got onto a bicycle and headed towards Havant town centre.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you see anyone dressed like the person in the CCTV image?

If so, we would like to speak to you as you may have information that could help with our investigation.

If you have any information, please call 101, quoting 44190246153, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
