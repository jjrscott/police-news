We are appealing for witnesses following a fire which damaged a large area of wildland at Alver Valley Country Park in Gosport.

At around 9.45pm on Friday 12 July, emergency services were called to the fire which took place on a large open area measuring 100x150 square metres.

We are treating this fire as arson.

If you were in the area between 9.20pm and 10pm and saw anything suspicious, officers are keen to speak to you.

Anyone with information is asked to call us on 101, quoting 44190243908, or call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
