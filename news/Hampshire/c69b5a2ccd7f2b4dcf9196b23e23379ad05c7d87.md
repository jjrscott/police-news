Do you recognise the man in this e-fit?

We would like to hear from anyone who recognises him following a report of a suspicious incident which took place on the Hilsea shoreline on Wednesday 20 January.

At around 9am, a woman in her thirties was running along the footpath between the Hilsea Lido and the Mountbatten Centre when she was approached by an unknown man who initially asked for the time.

When she said that she didn't have the time, he requested that she perform sexual acts on him. She refused and he then cycled away towards the Mountbatten Centre.

The woman was not injured.

We would like to hear from anyone who may have been in the area at the time and may have seen or heard anything.

We would also like to speak to the man pictured in the e-fit in connection with the incident.

He is described as follows:

 * White
 * Aged between 24 and 25-years-old
 * Wearing a khaki and black puffa jacket, North Face style, with the hood up and all dark clothing.

We have currently not received any other reports of this nature in the area.

If you have any information, recognise the man in the e-fit or have experienced similar incidents in the area then please call 101, quoting 44210022329.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org
