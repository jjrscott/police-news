Detectives investigating the death of Gurinderjit Rai in Corhampton have made another arrest.

A 51-year-old man from South Wales was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder on Saturday 28 September.

He has been released on police bail, pending further enquiries.

Gurinderjit's body was found in a car that was parked in Shepherds Farm Lane, Corhampton, on Saturday 13 July.

A post-mortem confirmed the man died as a result of gunshot wounds.

A total of 12 people have now been arrested as part of the investigation into the man's death.

On Friday 20 September, officers arrested a 66-year-old man and a 42-year-old man, both from Winchester, on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder.

On the previous day, a 20-year-old man from Winchester had been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder.

A 39-year-old man from Winchester had been arrested on conspiracy to commit murder back on Tuesday 20 August.

All four people have been given police bail, pending further enquiries.

Seven other men had previously been arrested in connection with the death and released on police bail, pending further enquiries.

As part of the investigation, officers are currently searching a house in Battery Hill, Winchester.

A scene is likely to remain in place for the coming week while officers carry out their enquiries.
