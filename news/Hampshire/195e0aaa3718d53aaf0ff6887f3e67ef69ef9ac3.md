Four teenagers will appear in court to face charges relating to two incidents in which sheep were injured at Alver Valley Nature Reserve in Gosport.

It is alleged that objects were thrown at the animals on Monday 29 April this year.

Police received a second report on Wednesday 1 May, shortly before 5.45pm, of an incident in which further injuries were caused to the sheep.

A 15-year-old girl, a 14-year-old boy, and a 13-year-old boy, all from Gosport, and a 14-year-old boy from Holbury, New Forest, will appear at Portsmouth Magistrates' Court on 25 November to face charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.

Two other 14-year-old boys arrested in connection with this incident have been released with no further action.

The charges follow a complex investigation by Hampshire Constabulary's dedicated Country Watch team, who lead our efforts to prevent, detect and disrupt rural and wildlife crime.
