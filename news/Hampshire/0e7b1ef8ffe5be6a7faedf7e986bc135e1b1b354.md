Officers responding to reports of a disturbance in Eastleigh town centre have arrested a man in connection with firearm offences.

The incident occurred at around 8.45pm on Friday 5 March behind businesses premises on Market Street, whereby two men were involved in an altercation with one another.

A man was assaulted and then threatened with a firearm, before fleeing from the scene.

Police conducted a number of enquiries in the local area shortly after the event to identify the offender and locate the weapon, which was later recovered from an address in Bishopstoke.

A 19-year-old man from Bishopstoke was arrested on suspicion of possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.

He was released on conditional bail until Wednesday 7 April, pending further police enquiries.
