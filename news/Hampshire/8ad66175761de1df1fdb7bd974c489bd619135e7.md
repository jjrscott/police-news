A man who assaulted a teenage boy in Eastleigh has been jailed for three and a half months.

Connor Oakes, aged 25, assaulted the 14-year-old following an altercation with other members of the boy's family outside of Iceland supermarket, at 4.15pm on Saturday 18 July. The boy attempted to calm and diffuse the situation but he was pushed to the floor, punched and slapped in the face, resulting in him suffering redness to his face and a bloodshot eye.

Southampton Magistrates Court heard how Oakes, along with another young person, began to pester the boy's sister and her boyfriend outside the store, before the situation escalated inside the store.

This culminated in the boy being assaulted and requiring hospital treatment.

Oakes, of Fulford Road, was sentenced at West Hampshire Court on 20 July to three and half months in jail. He was also ordered to pay costs of £85 to the Crown Prosecution Service, £400 victim compensation and £128 surcharge to fund victim services.

Police Sergeant Marcus Johns, said: "This case is a prime example of successful police partnership working at its best.

"Today a young violent offender has been punished at court and handed a substantial custodial sentence which not only safeguards the victims of his crimes, but also the community as a whole who can now feel safer going about their day to day business."
