Officers, who were executing a warrant at a property in Hamble-le-Rice, have seized a quantity of drugs.

They attended a property on Astral Gardens, in a pre-planned warrant, just after 10.30am on Friday 4 December. A large quantity of Class B drugs were located at the property and subsequently seized, alongside a number of other items associated with drug-related activity including a quantity of cash and mobile devices.

A 24-year-old man from Hamble-le-Rice was arrested on suspicion of possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply and one count of being concerned in the production of a Class B drug. He was later released under investigation pending further enquiries.
