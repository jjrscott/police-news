Did you go to the Whiteley Fireworks Display on Sunday 27 October?

If so, you may be able to help our enquiries into a report of an assault on a 14-year-old boy.

It took place near the stalls at the site at the Meadowside Recreation Field at around 8.20pm.

The victim was with two friends when he was approached by a group of around 15 boys that he did not know.

Two of the group held on to the victim while another punched him in the face.

The victim sustained a minor facial injury which did not require medical treatment.

One of the group was described as being white, aged 16 or 17, of large build with dark brown curly hair. He wore a dark blue Puffa-style jacket and was carrying fireworks.

A lot of people attended this event and we are keen to hear from anyone who saw what happened.

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44190385651.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 11, where information can be left anonymously.
