Macauley Bowers, 22, of Albion Towers, has been jailed for another four years after he pleaded guilty to another two burglaries at Southampton Crown Court on Friday (July 12).

Bowers appeared before the court whilst still serving his previous sentence of five years and four months which was given to him in December 2018 for nine other burglaries.

On Friday, Bowers admitted to burgling two other homes in Southampton. He admitted to entering a home in Westrow Road on Sept 14, 2018 and another home on September 18, 2018 in Bellemoor Road. .

Bowers stole jewellery, cash and a mobile phone.

Officers from the Operation Hawk team identified Bowers on CCTV near to the homes on the day they were burgled and his culpability was compounded when contact DNA was found on a branch he'd snapped off a tree and used to break the kitchen window at the home on Westrow Road. Bowers' footprint marks were also identified at both addresses.

These burglaries pre-date other offences he had previously been jailed for.

PC Charlie Buckingham from the Operation Hawk Team said: "We're dedicated to getting justice for victims of burglary, no matter how long it takes."
