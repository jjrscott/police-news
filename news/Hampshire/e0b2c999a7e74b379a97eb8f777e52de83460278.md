We're appealing for witnesses to a robbery which took place at a shop in Sandown.

At around 10.40pm on Monday 23 December, a man entered the Tesco Metro store on Lake Hill before threatening staff and demanding money.

Staff refused and the man, who was carrying a screwdriver in one hand and a bottle in the other, left the store.

Nothing was stolen.

The man was described as white, between 5ft 8ins and 6ft tall, of slight build with mousy brown hair.

He was described as wearing black tracksuit bottoms with coloured strips down the side, a black hoodie and black gloves.

We believe there were other people shopping in the store at the time of this incident, and we would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44190460501.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org
