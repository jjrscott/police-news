The family of a man who sadly died following a collision on the A303 have today paid tribute to him.

Andrew Shanahan, 29, of Churchill Way in Basingstoke, was driving a Volkswagen Scirocco on the A303, near Shipton Bellinger, before it was in the collision just after 7.30am on 28 January.

Sadly, despite best efforts of the emergency services he was pronounced dead at the scene.

Andrew's family have today paid tribute to him. They said: "Andrew was a loving son and brother who was making plans for the future with his dear girlfriend.

"We are heartbroken.

"Andrew will be missed by his wider family and friends. He had great character and a terrific sense of humour and that is how we will all remember him"

We are investigating the exact circumstances of the collision, and continue to appeal for any information or footage that could help.

Were you in the area at the time? Perhaps you have dash cam footage showing Andrew's vehicle or a white Volkswagen Luton Van before the collision?

Anyone with information, or dash-cam footage, is asked to contact police on 101, quoting Operation Saffron, or 44210032680.

Alternatively, you can phone Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
