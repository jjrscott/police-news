We are releasing E-fits of two women we want to identify after an elderly man had his Rolex watch stolen in Emsworth.

At around 12.30pm on Wednesday 15 July, the 78-year-old victim was approached by two women in the High Street who pushed him into an enclosed area and stole his watch.

The women were described as aged in their 20s, around 5ft 4ins tall, with olive complexions and dark hair. One was described as average build with a Portuguese accent, and the other was slightly larger than average build.

The stolen watch is described as a Rolex GMT Master II with a black face. However, the bezel has been replaced with a black Rolex Submariner bezel with the small pearl setting at 12 o'clock, making it more distinctive.

There is also minor damage in three places on the inside of the watch bracelet.

We want to identify the two women pictured as part of our enquiries, and are appealing to anyone who knows who they are or who may have seen them in the area.

In addition, we would ask anyone, including local businesses, who are offered sale of a watch matching the one stolen to report this to police.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44200262386.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org
