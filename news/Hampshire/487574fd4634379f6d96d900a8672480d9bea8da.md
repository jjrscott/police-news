Officers attending to the welfare of an intoxicated woman, which resulted in a police officer being assaulted, have charged a woman.

The incident occurred at approximately 8.25pm on Tuesday 4 August on Southampton Road in Eastleigh.

An officer was stopped by a member of the public, reporting that a woman who appeared to be intoxicated was walking in the road.

As officers checked on the woman's welfare, it was confirmed that she was wanted in connection with earlier reports of criminal damage in the area and was subsequently arrested. During the arrest, the woman became agitated and aggressive, resulting in an officer suffering minor facial injuries.

Marie Claire Moss, aged 37, of Loveridge Way in Eastleigh was charged with assault of an emergency worker.

She is due to appear at Southampton Magistrates Court on 24 September.
