We're appealing for information after an 18-year-old man was robbed in Southampton.

At around 7.30pm Monday, 7 September, the 18-year-old was in Riverside Park with friends when he was approached by two people on a black Honda motorbike, registration LG64 OAP.

The pillion got off the motorbike and grabbed the victim, who was stood on his electric scooter. The pillion then threatened the victim with a knife before taking the scooter, placing it over his shoulder and getting back on the motorbike.

The males then rode off in the direction of Manor Farm Road.

The motorbike used in this incident is reported as stolen.

The victim did not receive any injuries.

One of the males was described as white, approximately 5ft 10ins tall and of skinny build. He was wearing blue denim jeans, a glossy black puffer coat and a black moped helmet with a black visor.

The second male was described as white, approximately 6ft tall and of average build. He was wearing blue denim jeans, a matte black puffer coat and a black moped helmet.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you witness anything? Do you recognise the descriptions of the males and/or the motorbike? Perhaps you were driving through and caught them on dashcam?

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44200345638.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org
