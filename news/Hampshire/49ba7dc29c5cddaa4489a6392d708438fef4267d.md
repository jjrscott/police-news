We are appealing for witnesses after a road traffic incident in Hornden yesterday afternoon, Wednesday 9 December.

The incident occurred at around 1pm when a vehicle failed to stop when requested by an unmarked police car on Portsmouth Road.

A short pursuit ensued with the vehicle entering the Morrison's cark park on Lakesmere Road, leaving the premises on the wrong side of the road and along Dell Piece West on London Road in Cowplain. The vehicle then entered Padnell Road where the occupants of the vehicle decamped.

Officers arrested a 36-year-old man on suspicion of taking a vehicle without consent, failure to stop, dangerous driving, being in possession of an offensive weapon and failing to comply with a preliminary drug test.

While a 39-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of taking a vehicle without consent and possession of a Class A drug.

Both remain in custody at this time.

However, while police enquiries are ongoing, officers are particularly keen to speak with anyone who may have been in the area at the time and has dash-cam footage of the incident.

Anyone with any such information is asked to call 101, quoting 44200475132.

Alternatively, you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
