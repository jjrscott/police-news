Do you recognise this man? We would like to speak to him in connection with a burglary in Basingstoke.

The incident occurred at 3.30pm on March 2 at a jewellery store in New Street.

A staff member had left a tray of gold and semi-precious rings out but had covered them with a towel while serving a customer.

The suspect had come into the shop and squeezed through a gap in a partition to an area not accessible to members of the public. He grabbed the tray of rings and ran out of the shop.

The suspect is described as being an Asian male, of stocky build and aged between 30 and 40. He is approximately 5'6" to 5'8" tall and was wearing a leather jacket.

Do you recognise him? If you can help, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200080222.

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
