A 42-year-old man who was arrested in Thailand in connection with the attempted murder of a 19-year-old man, appeared before Winchester Crown Court on Tuesday, September 3.

Glen Johnson, AKA Glen Bailey, from Farnborough is charged with failing to appear in court in March this year.

Johnson was deported from Thailand on Wednesday, August 28 and flown back to the UK after being arrested on a warrant in Pattaya on August 20 by Thai Police.

Johnson had earlier been reported for summons for assisting an offender in connection with the shooting on February 10, 2018, in Hearsey Gardens, Blackwater. The 19-year-old victim was left paralysed from the waist down.

A 17-year-old man from Blackwater has been charged with attempted murder and is due to stand trial at Winchester Crown Court on October 2. A 51-year-old woman, also from Blackwater, was summonsed to court for assisting an offender and will appear at Winchester on October 2.
