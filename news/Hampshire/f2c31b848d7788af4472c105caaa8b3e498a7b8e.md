We are appealing for witnesses following a burglary in the early hours of this morning (Wednesday 11 November) at a house on Bishop Crispian Way in the Charles Dickens area of Portsmouth.

We were called to the incident just after midnight.

Several bottles of alcohol were taken from the property.

As part of our investigation we've arrested an 18-year-old male from Portsmouth on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon in a public place and a 17-year-old male, also from Portsmouth, on suspicion of dwelling burglary and theft.

Officers investigating would like to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and may have seen or heard anything.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 with the reference 44200436505.
