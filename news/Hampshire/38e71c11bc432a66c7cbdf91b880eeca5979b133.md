We are appealing for witnesses after a man received serious injuries in a collision at a petrol station in Aldershot.

The incident happened at around 5pm on Monday 21 September, at the Gulf petrol station in High Street.

It was reported that there was a collision between a black BMW car and a 67-year-old man on the station forecourt.

The man sustained a serious arm injury and needed treatment at hospital.

A 34-year-old man from Aldershot was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent. He has since been released from custody but remains under investigation.

Detectives are investigating the circumstances of this incident and would like to speak to anyone with information that may assist.

In particular, we believe that several people were queuing in the shop at the time and may have seen what happened.

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44200366867.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
