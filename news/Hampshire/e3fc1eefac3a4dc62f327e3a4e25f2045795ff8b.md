Officers from Fareham have used Section 61 powers to move on a group of travellers who set up in Portchester.

The group arrived at Wicor Recreation Ground, off Cranleigh Road, on Thursday 6 August.

Acting Chief Inspector Richard Thompson authorised the order, having undertaken a full review of the circumstances and reports of anti-social behaviour. The direction was issued on the evening of Tuesday 11 August for the group to move by 11am the following day.

The group has now left the site.

Under Section 61 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, powers can be considered by police in the following circumstances:

 * Significant nuisance or criminal behaviour
 * Unacceptable levels of damage to land or property to gain entry or remain
 * Danger to travellers from the chosen site, such as environmental health factors

Acting Chief Insp Thompson said:

"In using these powers, Hampshire Constabulary will always ensure that we balance the needs and rights of all our communities with actions that are proportionate, lawful and necessary.

"I hope this swift action to move the travellers on from locations that were unsuitable will convey to all sections of the community that a robust approach will be taken against encampments within legal parameters.

"We will continue to work closely with partner agencies and private landowners to manage unauthorised encampments and identify repeat locations where there has been criminality or disorder in order to target harden these sites."
