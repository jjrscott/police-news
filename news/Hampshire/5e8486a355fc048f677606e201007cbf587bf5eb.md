We're appealing for information following a burglary at Smith Bradbeer's department store in Romsey, in the early hours of this morning (Monday 18 January).

The incident happened between 5am and 5.30am at the store on Bell Street.

A Land Rover discovery parked at the rear of the store between the public toilets and the rear of Boots the chemist.

A group of people then forced entry to Bradbeers and took an unknown quantity of perfume from inside.

Did you see the vehicle in this area around this time? Perhaps you captured it on Dash Cam, or mobile phone footage.

Did you capture the vehicle registration number, or perhaps you can describe the occupants?

This incident is under investigation and our enquiries remain ongoing.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44210019533.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org
