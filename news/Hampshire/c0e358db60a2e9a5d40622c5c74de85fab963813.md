A dispersal order has been put in place in the area of Fratton Way this weekend as part of an operation to reduce anti-social behaviour and associated crime.

It gives officers the power to disperse people under Section 35 of the ASB, Crime and Policing Act 2012, they can also seize any items used in the commission of anti-social behaviour.

The order covers an area that includes Winston Churchill Avenue and was put in place on Saturday 25 April and will last until 3.59pm Monday 27 April.

Sergeant Neil Bateman said: "We know that the increase in anti-social behaviour has had a big impact on those living and working in the Fratton area and we have put in place a dispersal order to reduce the issue.

"We will continue to patrol the area in the coming weeks, so if you have any concerns, please do not hesitate to raise these with officers, or report incidents via 101 or online."

This dispersal order is not related to Covid-19, but of course we would like to remind everyone of the government advice to stay at home: www.gov.uk/coronavirus
