Officers investigating a robbery in Gosport are appealing for witnesses.

The incident happened between 10.15pm and 11pm last night, 28 July, on Burnett Road.

Two men, parked in a Land Rover, were approached by three men who dragged them from the vehicle and assaulted them before stealing their cash, bank cards, and tobacco.

One victim, a 27-year-old man from Gosport, sustained a head injury during the assault and was taken Queen Alexandra Hospital for treatment. His injuries are not considered life-threatening or life-changing.

The other victim, a 24-year-old man from Gosport, was treated by paramedics at the scene.

The suspects then got into a white car, similar to a Volkswagen Touran, and drove off in the direction of Anns Hill Road.

We are keen to speak with anyone who has any information that may help our investigation.

Were you in the area at the time? Perhaps you saw a white car driving away from Burnett Road?

We are particularly keen to identify the three men, who are described below:

 * A white man, aged between 25 and 30-years-old, with short hair. He was also described as wearing a blue jumper.
 * A white man, aged between 25 and 30-years-old, approximately 5ft 9ins and a medium build. He was also described as wearing a blue Nike hat.
 * A white man, aged between 25 and 30-years-old.

We appreciate these are not detailed descriptions, but perhaps you remember seeing three young men in the area around the relevant time?

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 with the reference 44200283418. Alternatively, you can phone Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
