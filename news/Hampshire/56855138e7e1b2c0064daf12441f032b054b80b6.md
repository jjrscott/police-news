Two teenagers charged with offences following a serious assault in Barnfield Road, Southampton appeared at Southampton Youth Court today (29 October).

A 14-year-old boy charged with attempted murder has been remanded to appear at Winchester Crown Court on 6 November.

A 14-year-old boy charged with possession of a knife pleaded guilty to the offence and is next due to appear at Southampton Magistrates' Court on 30 November for sentence.

The charges come after we were called at 12.40am on Tuesday, 27 October by colleagues from the ambulance service, to a report of a serious assault on Barnfield Road, Southampton.

A 56-year-old man suffered stab wounds to his neck and stomach following an altercation with two people. He was taken to Southampton General Hospital where he is being treated for serious, but non-life threatening injuries.
