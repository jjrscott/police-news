Do you recognise this man?

We want to speak with him in connection with the theft of a bicycle in Gamble Road, Portsmouth, on Thursday 2 July.

Around 8pm, a teenage boy was approached and pushed from his bicycle, before it was ridden away by a man in the direction of Malins Road.

Officers investigating the incident are keen to identify the man in this CCTV image in connection with this.

We appreciate the image is not the clearest, but we hope that someone may still be able to recognise him.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200242954. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
