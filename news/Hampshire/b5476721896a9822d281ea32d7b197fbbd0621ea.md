**We are investigating an incident where two men in their 20s received injuries after being assaulted by a group of youths in Yateley.

Officers were called to Reading Road, Yateley, near the Dog & Partridge pub, following a report from the Ambulance Service.

The incident is said to have occurred between 8.30pm and 8.45pm pm on July 9.** ** The victims were walking from Manor Park Drive towards the village green in Yateley.

They have gone through the alley way that leads into the grounds of St Peter's Church, where they encountered the group of around eight people, both male and female, and an altercation has taken place.

One of the victims was taken to hospital with cuts that are described as not life threatening and the other received an injury to his chin that did not require hospital treatment.

At this stage, there have been no arrests and enquiries are ongoing.
