Officers are continuing to investigate an incident that happened in Eastleigh yesterday evening (Wednesday 20 November) whereby a group of young people were reported as fighting in the Chamberlayne Road and Grantham Road areas.

We received a number of reports from residents reporting a group was fighting, some of them in possession of weapons.

We deployed to the area and arrested three people on suspicion of violent disorder, two 16-year-old boys from Southampton and one 19-year-old woman from Southampton.

They have remained in police custody overnight and are being questioned by officers today (November 21).
Chief Inspector Darren Miller said: "We know that this incident has understandably concerned a number of residents.

"I would like to thank those who called us and notified us about what they saw. You are our eyes and ears out there and we are very grateful for information you pass to us.

"The investigation into who was involved and exactly what happened is ongoing. Officers in the Eastleigh Central Neighbourhood Policing Team have been in the area today conducting patrols and assisting the investigation.

"We are following up all lines of enquiry available to us and would ask anyone with CCTV or dash cam footage of the incident to get in touch."
