We are appealing for witnesses after a blue Honda Prelude failed to stop for police in Fareham last week.

The vehicle, which had allegedly been involved in a piece of dangerous driving, was abandoned at the Cams Mill pub, close to the Delme roundabout, around 11.50am on Monday, May 4.

Members of the public at the scene reported seeing a man running away from where the vehicle was left and helped point officers in the direction he had gone.

A 21-year-old man from Southampton was arrested on suspicion of driving a motor vehicle dangerously, failing to stop and making off without payment.

He has been released under investigation.

Officers are keen to speak with anyone who was close to the Cams Hill pub on May 4, as they continue with their investigations.

In particular, they wish to speak with two dog walkers who were walking towards the pub and we believe would have seen the vehicle when it was abandoned.

Anyone with information should call 101, quoting the reference 44200157001.
