Tribute has today been paid to 26-year-old Billy Green, who died on Monday 11 January.

Officers were called to Pickwick House, Wingfield Street, at 12.43pm to reports of a serious assault and on arrival at the scene found Billy, who had been stabbed.

Crews from South Central Ambulance Service also attended but he was pronounced dead at the scene.

Today, his family have paid tribute to him.

In a statement, they said: "Our first-born son, heartbroken parents, taken way too young, he had his whole life to live.

"Billy will always be in our hearts and memories. A cheeky chappy with an infectious laugh. Loved forever by mum, dad and family."
