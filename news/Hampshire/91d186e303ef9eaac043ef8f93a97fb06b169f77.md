We are appealing for witnesses, or anyone with information, to come forward following a burglary at a bank in Southampton.

The incident occurred at sometime between 8.30pm and 9.45pm on Saturday 16 January at the Lloyds bank branch on Above Bar Street.

Three men appeared to gain entry to the premises and into the ATM cash machine area of the lobby. Nothing was reported as stolen.

We have conducted initial lines of enquiry, but we're now turning to the public for help.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you see what happened or see anyone acting suspiciously?

Anyone with information is asked to call 101, quoting 44210018273.

Alternatively you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
