Do you recognise the people in these images?

We'd like to speak to them following a robbery at a Southampton shop on Thursday.

Officers were called at 4.40pm on Thursday, (April 9) following reports of a robbery at the One Stop store in North East Road, Sholing.

It was reported that a man grabbed money from the till and threatened staff as he fled the store.

He was seen leaving with a man and a woman, who all got into a car and drove off.

Officers leading the investigation would like to speak to the three people shown in the CCTV images, as they believe they could have information that will help with this investigation.

Do you know who they are? Did you see these people in the area that day?

Anyone with information is asked to call us on 101, quoting 44200126918, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
