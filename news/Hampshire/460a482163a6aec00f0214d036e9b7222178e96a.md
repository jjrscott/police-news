We're appealing for information after a man was stabbed in the leg in Commercial Road, Portsmouth, in the early hours of yesterday morning (Saturday 13 July).

At about 12.25am a 21-year-old man presented himself to ambulance staff in Edinburgh Road. He said he'd been stabbed in the leg when he was near Debenhams in Commercial Road.

It's believed the man had been stood outside of the Park Tavern in Edinburgh Road when he got into an altercation with two men who got out of a taxi on the other side of the road.

We'd like to hear from anyone who was in the Commercial Road / Edinburgh Road area around the time of the incident and saw anything suspicious.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting 44190243880.
