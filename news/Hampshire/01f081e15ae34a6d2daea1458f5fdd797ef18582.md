We are investigating the death of a woman at a house in Hambledon.

Officers were called at 12.39pm on Monday 1 July to Vicarage Lane where the body of a woman in her 50s was discovered.

The woman's next of kin have been informed, but formal identification procedures have not yet taken place.

A teenager from the Hambledon area has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody at this time.
