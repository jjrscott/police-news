Four people have been arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods and drugs offences after officers carried out two warrants in Southampton.

This morning (Thursday 29 October), officers from Southampton's High Harm Team executed the warrants at two addresses in Irving Road.

Two men aged 20 and 23 and two women aged 43 and 62, all from Southampton, have been arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods and possession with intent to supply drugs.

They remain in police custody at this time.

Acting Inspector Allan Dineley said: "The warrants were carried out under Operation Fortress, Hampshire Constabulary's ongoing campaign to reduce drug related harm.

"Drug supply can often be linked to a variety of other crimes, such as theft, burglary, robbery and serious violence, which is why it is so vital we identify the root of the issue.

"I'd like to reassure residents that we are doing all we can to tackle drugs supply in Southampton and keep our communities safe.

"If you suspect drug dealing, drug-related activity or associated crime in your area, then please call 101 or the anonymous Crimestoppers charity on 0800 555 111.

"All information could help us catch and convict those who deal drugs to our communities and even the smallest pieces of information can help us develop a clearer intelligence picture."
