We are appealing for information after a serious injury collision in Brading at about 7.20am on Thursday 28 November.

We were called to the A3055 New Road after a Mazda was involved in a collision with a 14-year-old pedestrian crossing the road just north of the B3395 Sandown Road.

The boy was taken to Southampton General Hospital with serious injuries.

One lane of the road was closed for about five hours while officers from the Roads Policing Unit began their investigation into the collision.

We are appealing for any witnesses to the incident to call us on 101 quoting 44190428146.
