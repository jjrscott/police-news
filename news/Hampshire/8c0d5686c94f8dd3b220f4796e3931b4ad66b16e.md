We are appealing for witnesses after a man died in a single vehicle collision on Western Esplanade, Southampton, at about 11pm last night (30 September).

The only occupant of the car, a man in his 30s, died at the scene and his next of kin are being supported by specialist officers.

The vehicle hit an electricity sub-station, causing a fire that was dealt with by Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service.

Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) are currently dealing with power outages to a small number of businesses on Western Esplanade.

It is not believed that any local residents were affected.

If you have any information about the collision, please call 101 quoting 44190349894.

Did you see a black BMW 520 saloon any time before the incident?

All roads are now open again.
