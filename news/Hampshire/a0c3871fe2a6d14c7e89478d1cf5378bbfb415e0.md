Do you recognise this man? We want to speak to him in connection with an assault outside a Basingstoke chicken shop.

The incident occurred at around 2.10am in the early hours of Sunday, January 12.

The 32 year old victim had been out for the night and went to the Chick Mex shop on Church Street.

Outside the shop, he was assaulted and ends up on the ground. He was taken to hospital where he was diagnosed with a broken elbow which required surgery.

The suspect is described as being a slim white male, around six feet tall with dark black short hair that is spiky on the top.
