We're appealing for witnesses after a delivery driver was robbed in Southampton.

At around 5pm on Friday 14 August the victim, a 23-year-old man from Southampton, parked his moped on Evenlode Road. When he returned from a delivery he found it had been stolen.

He found the moped in Mansel Park with a group of around fifteen young people.

The victim attempted to get his moped back but was assaulted numerous times by the group, causing him bruising and pain.

The group attempted to steal the moped again as they assaulted him.

Local residents came to his rescue and the group ran off toward Kendal Avenue.

Officers investigating have made a number of enquiries but we are now appealing to the public for help.

Were you in the area at the time? Perhaps you have mobile phone footage or photographs of the group?

Anyone with any information, or any CCTV footage that could help us, is asked to phone 101 with the reference 44200310383. Alternatively, you can phone Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
