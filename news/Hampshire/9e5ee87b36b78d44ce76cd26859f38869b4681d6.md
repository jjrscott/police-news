Officers on patrol in Totton have arrested a man for possession of a Class A drug following a successful stop and search.

The incident occurred at around 9.25pm yesterday evening (3 December) in Eling, Totton.

Officers spotted a vehicle entered the Eling Cemetery car park and conducted a series of suspicious movements. They spoke to the owner of the vehicle, which was subsequently searched, after officers had concerns about the drivers condition.

A quantity of Class A drugs were located in the vehicle and seized as a result.

A 48-year-old man from Calshot was arrested on suspicion of possession of a Class A drug and driving whilst unfit through drugs / drink.

He remains in custody at this time.

Throughout December, officers from our Roads Policing Unit will be carrying out checks for drink and drug drivers as part of Operation Holly. Driving while impaired can have tragic consequences and our message is simple; it's not worth the risk.
