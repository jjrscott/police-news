Two men and one boy are in police custody this morning (August 14) after homes in West End, Rownhams and Fareham were burgled.

All the homes were entered overnight between August 12 and August 13.

A home in Tower Place, West End was entered and a Volkswagen Golf was stolen. The car has since been recovered.

Two homes on Nutshalling Avenue in Rownhams were entered, a Vauxhall Astra and Volkswagen Golf were stolen from one address along with mobile phones and a handbag, and electrical items were stolen from the other. The Astra has since been recovered.

A home on Lower Swanwick Road was entered and a Ford Kuga was taken. It has since been recovered by police.

Officers investigating the burglaries have since arrested an 18-year-old man, a 21-year-old man and a 17-year-old boy in connection with the incidents. They are all from Southampton.

They remain in police custody at this time.

Officers investigating these offences would like to remind people to be vigilant about double locking their front doors and keeping car keys away from the front door so that they cannot be 'fished' through letterboxes.
