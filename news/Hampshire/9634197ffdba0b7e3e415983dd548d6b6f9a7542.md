We are appealing for witnesses and dash cam footage after a man and woman suffered injuries following a collision involving a bicycle and van in Southampton.

Police were called just before 9.50pm to a report of an incident on Waterloo Road.

A woman, in her 40s, and a man, in his 30s, had suffered injuries. It was reported a light-coloured van left the scene following the incident.

Both the man and woman were taken to hospital, but neither of their injuries are believed to be life-threatening.

Officers are investigating the exact circumstances of the collision, and are keen to speak with anyone who can assist them.

Anyone with information or dash cam footage can call 101, quoting reference 44200266371.
