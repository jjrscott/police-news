We're appealing for witnesses following an arson in Southampton.

Just before 11pm on Monday, 29 March, a bin shed area close to a block of flats in Montague Avenue, was set alight.

The fire spread up the stairwell of the building causing substantial damage.

No-one was injured.

A 33-year-old man from Southampton has been arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life. He has been questioned by officers and released on police bail with conditions.

Officers investigating are keen to speak to anyone who may have witnessed anything or seen someone acting suspiciously near the bin area at around the time of the incident. We would also like to know if there have been any other previous incidents that have not been reported.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting reference 44210118469.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
