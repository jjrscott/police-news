We're appealing for witnesses after reports of a man indecently exposing himself in Bishops Waltham.

The incident occurred at around 1.30pm on Wednesday, 5 August, in the Bishops Waltham Palace grounds near to the Station Road gate.

Two 15-year-old girls saw a naked man in the grounds appearing to touch himself inappropriately.

He is described as being a white man around 40-years-old, of medium build with a "beer belly", he had tanned arms and legs with a pale body, and dark hair.

The girls had seen him before he removed his clothes, and described him as wearing a plain black t-shirt, plain back shorts, and carrying a black rucksack.

Officers have made a number of enquiries and are now turning to you for help.

Were you in the Bishops Waltham Palace grounds on Wednesday at the relevant times? Perhaps you saw someone matching the description, or may have captured him in the background of a photo you took?

We are also keen to speak to a woman who spoke with the two girls and may have also witnessed the incident.

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 and quote the reference 44200295051.
