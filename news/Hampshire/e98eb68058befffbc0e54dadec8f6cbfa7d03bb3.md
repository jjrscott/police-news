Detectives would like to appeal to drivers with dash cam after a man on a push bike died following a collision with a van on July 17 on Waterloo Road in Southampton.

Daniel Blakeman, aged 35, from Southampton who was riding the bike, died in hospital on Tuesday 11 August.

A woman in her 40s, who was also on the bicycle with Daniel Blakeman, sustained non-life-threatening injuries.

The incident happened at 9.50pm on Waterloo Road and involved a white Citroen Berlingo 625 En-Prise.

Detectives arrested two men in connection in with the incident.

On Tuesday 11 August he was re-arrested on suspicion of murder and conspiracy to murder.

Both men have since been released on bail until Sept 8 to allow for further enquiries to take place.

"We are looking at this wide time scale as we would like to capture any footage of the incident and any activity thereafter that may involve the white Citroen Berlingo 625 En-Prise.
