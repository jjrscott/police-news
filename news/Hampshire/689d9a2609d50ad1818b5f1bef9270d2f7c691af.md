(L-R John, Steven and William Nolan)

Three men who carried out high value burglaries in the north of the county have been jailed for a combined total of 17 years.

John Nolan, aged 36, and his brothers - 30-year-old Steven Nolan and 26-year-old William Nolan - targeted homes in Baughurst, Old Basing, Farnborough and Aldershot between 10 October 2018 and 15 January this year.

Thirteen homes in total were broken into by the trio, who stole large quantities of jewellery and cash.

Yesterday (26 September), the three brothers, all of Beech Close in West Drayton, London, were sentenced for the burglaries at Winchester Crown Court.

Steven was jailed for five and a half years for his involvement in the crimes, John was jailed for six years, and William was jailed for five and a half years.

Following the sentencing, Police Staff Investigator Dulcie Smith said: "We welcome the sentences imposed by the courts which have ensured these three selfish and callous individuals are off our streets.

"I hope this reassures our communities that we do not tolerate this type of offending, and that we will work hard to bring these people to justice."
