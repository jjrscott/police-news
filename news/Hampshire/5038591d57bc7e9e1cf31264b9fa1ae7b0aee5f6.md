We are appealing for witnesses following a report of a burglary at the Waterside Dental Practice on Langdown Lane in Hythe.

Entry was forced into the property between 7pm on Tuesday 21 July and 1am on Wednesday 22 July. CCTV images in the area show two individuals running towards the dentist at approximately 11.52pm and then running away from the property at approximately 12.27am.

A sterilising cleaning machine - worth approximately £1,000 - was stolen during the burglary, as well as a range of dental instruments worth approximately £10,000.

We have conducted a number of enquiries and are now turning to the public for help.

Did you see anything? Perhaps you saw someone acting suspiciously in the area at the time?

This machine is highly unique so if you've been offered this item or have any information relating to the burglary we would ask that you call police on 101, quoting 44200272896.

Alternatively, you can call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
