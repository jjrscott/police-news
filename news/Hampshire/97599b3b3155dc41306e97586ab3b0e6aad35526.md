Officers have made an arrest after carrying out a search warrant in Southampton.

Our Southampton West Neighbourhood Policing Team carried out the search warrant at a house in Old Redbridge Road this morning (Monday 29 June).

A quantity of drugs and cash were seized.

A 30-year-old man from Southampton was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a Class B drug - cannabis. He is currently in police custody.

Inspector Sarah Nicholson from Southampton West Neighbourhood Policing Team said: "I'd like to reassure residents that we are doing everything we can to tackle the supply of drugs in Southampton and keep our communities safe from the harm they cause.

"If you have concerns about drug-related activity in your area, please don't assume that someone else will report it. Even the smallest piece of information can help us develop a clearer intelligence picture and target our resources.

"Anyone with information should call us on 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
