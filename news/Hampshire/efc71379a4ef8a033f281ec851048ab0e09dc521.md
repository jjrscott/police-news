We are appealing for witnesses following a fail to stop collision on the B2177 near to North Boarhunt on Tuesday (16 July).

We were called following a collision shortly after 8am, involving a Renault Clio and a small red car at the Staple Cross crossroads.

The driver of the Clio, a 22-year-old woman, from Portsmouth, sustained back and neck injuries, which required hospital treatment.

The other car failed to stop at the scene.

Officers are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident or may have any information leading to the identity of the driver of the small red car.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 and quote 44190247904 or call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
