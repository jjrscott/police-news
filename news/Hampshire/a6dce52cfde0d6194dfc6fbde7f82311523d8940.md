We are now in a position to release a CCTV image of a man we'd like to speak to in connection with a robbery in Andover.

He had his bank card and £40 stolen from his wallet.

The man we would like to assist us with our enquiries is described as follows:

• 25-35 years old
• Black
• Medium build
• Dark hair and a chin strap beard

If you recognise this man or have any other information about this incident, please call 101 quoting 44190392898.
