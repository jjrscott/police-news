Officers investigating an assault on a woman in Lordshill are appealing for witnesses and are particularly keen to speak with a man who intervened.

The incident happened just before 5pm on Friday 5 March, in the car park by Lordshill library, in Upper Brownhill Road.

An 18-year-old woman was assaulted by a woman believed to be known to her, leaving her with injuries to her ribs and concussion.
