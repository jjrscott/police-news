A 33-year-old man has been charged with shoplifting and subsequently three counts of assault.

Simon Barnes, of Patrick House in Southampton, was detained by a PCSO and off duty Police Sergeant after shoplifting a number of clothing items from TK Maxx. In the ensuing discussions, Barnes began to resist arrest and as a result, assaulted two police officers, as well as a member of the public.

He was remanded at West Hampshire Magistrates Court and is due to appear in court on Thursday 30 July.

The incident occurred at 10.51am on Friday 24 July outside the TK Maxx store at the Swan Centre in Eastleigh.
