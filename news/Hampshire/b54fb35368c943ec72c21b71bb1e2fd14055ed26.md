Do you recognise this man?

We are keen to speak with him in connection with an attempted robbery at the Premier Store on St Denys Road, Southampton.

A man entered the store, before approaching the counter and demanding money from the till. However, he left again without taking anything.

The incident happened just after 7am on Monday 11 January.

Officers investigating are keen to speak with anyone who recognises this man.

He is described as being white, between 20 and 30 years old, of slim build and around 6ft tall.

He was wearing a dark grey zip up hoodie, light grey tracksuit bottoms, a hi-vis jacket, builders gloves, a black baseball cap, and black trainers. He also had on a pair of dark rimmed glasses and had a Tesco bag with him.

Officers are keen to speak with anyone who recognises the man.

We are also keen to hear from anyone in the area of St Denys Road and Priory Road who has CCTV outside their property which may have captured footage of the man.

Anyone with information should call 101, quoting the reference 44210010833. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
