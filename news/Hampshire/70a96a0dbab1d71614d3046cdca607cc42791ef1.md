Do you recognise these people?

Officers have released this CCTV image of a man and a woman they would like to speak to in connection with an incident in a Southampton nightclub.

Between 8.30pm and 9pm on Saturday, 24 October, a man entered Fever and Vibe in Bedford Place, Southampton carrying a knife.

An argument broke out inside the club and the man was escorted out of the premises.

After leaving, the man got into a black Honda Civic, registration RJ07 CLU, with a woman described as having blonde hair, before driving off.

The man is described as being between 20-30 years old, 6ft 2 inches tall, medium / stocky build, with short afro hair, a moustache and a goatee beard.

He was wearing a blue Tommy Hilfiger jumper with a white stripe, black puma tracksuit bottoms with a white stripe and puma logo.
