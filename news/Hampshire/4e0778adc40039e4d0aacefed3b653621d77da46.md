The family of a man who sadly died in a collision on the M271 last week have today paid tribute to him.

We were called just after 8.30am on Tuesday 17 November to a collision involving four vehicles, a heavy goods vehicle, Nissan Navara, Mercedes Vito van and Citroen Relay van.

Sadly, David Stephen Joseph Sullivan, 64, of Eastern Road, Wivelsfield Green, West Sussex, was pronounced dead following the collision.

He was driving the Citroen Relay.

Paying tribute to him today, his family said: "Dave, beloved husband to Wendy, Father to Kathryn and Tom, Stepfather to Laura, Adam and Craig, Grandfather to Ross, Sophie, Jack, Ivy, Isaac and Lucy.

"He will be very sorely and sadly missed by everyone who knew and loved him."

We are continuing to make enquiries into the exact circumstances of the collision.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or with information that may assist should call 101, quoting the reference 44200444863.
