We are appealing for a man, who we believe witnessed an assault in Above Bar Street in September, to make contact with us.

Shortly after midnight on 29 September 2019, two men in their 40s were punched and kicked by a man they did not know near to the East Park Titanic Memorial.

We believe the man in the picture witnessed this incident, so we are asking him, or anyone who knows this man, to make contact with us.

Officers would also like to hear from anyone else who witnessed the incident, including a man who rode past the scene on an electric scooter.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44190347445.

As part of this investigation, a 27-year-old man from Whiteley has been arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

He has been released from custody but remains under investigation.
