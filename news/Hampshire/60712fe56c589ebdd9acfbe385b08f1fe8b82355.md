We're investigating an attempted robbery on Petersfield Road, near to The Drive in Havant at around 10:10pm on Monday 28 September.

A 21 year-old woman who was walking south was approached by two teenagers riding bicycles. One of the teenagers demanded money and threatened the victim with a knife with a black handle.

Nothing was taken and the victim was not hurt.

The victim described the first teenager as:

 * White
 * Between 16 and 18 years-old
 * He was wearing a black ¾ length coat with the hood up, black tracksuit bottoms, and a black material snood neck tube covering the lower half of his face.

She described the second teenager as:

 * White
 * Between 16 and 18 years-old.
 * He was wearing a grey reflective ¾ length jacket, but not wearing a mask.

Both teenagers rode off towards the gateway near to the new block of flats on the old pub site on Petersfield Road.

We have not received any other similar reports in the area.

Anyone who saw either teenager in the area is asked to phone 101 quoting 44200377239.
