We would like to speak to the woman pictured in connection with an incident in which a partially sighted pensioner had a quantity of cash stolen from his pocket.

The incident occurred between 12pm and 2pm on Monday, January 13. The 73 year old victim had just been to the bank to withdraw his pension money at Festival Place, Basingstoke.

He got into the lift with a female who engaged him in conversation. It was only after he left the lift, he realised the money was missing.

Do you recognise the woman pictured in the CCTV image? If you can help, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200016463.
