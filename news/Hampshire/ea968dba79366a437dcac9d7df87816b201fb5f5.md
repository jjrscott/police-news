A man has been arrested for attacking an on-duty police officer in Basingstoke this evening (April 12).

Officers attended Churchill Way, Basingstoke, at 4.30pm, following a concern for welfare call.

We attended the scene and while there, one of our officers was attacked by a man, leaving him with serious injuries.

The officer was taken to North Hampshire Hospital where his injuries are described as serious but not life threatening.

His next-of-kin have been informed and both the officer and his family are receiving support from our officers.

A 43-year-old man, from Basingstoke, has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
