Dean Lewis Lee, aged 28, of no fixed address was jailed for 14 years on Friday (August 2) for robbery and burglary.

The sentence was handed to Lee after a jury found him guilty following a trial at Southampton Crown Court last week.

Lee entered a house on Downs Park Avenue in Eling, Totton on January 30 and threatened the people inside with a knife. He stole their wallet and a handbag and then left the house and walked down a gravel walkway at the bottom of Downs Park Avenue near an area of marshland known as Bartley Water.

A key piece of evidence was the knife Lee had used, which was recovered from the undergrowth behind the victim's property. The knife was forensically examined and Lee's DNA was found, linking him to the scene.

The handbag he had stolen was recovered a few months after the incident near to Ealing Tide Mill.

Lee's victims, a man in his 70s and woman in her 60s, were left severely affected by the incident.

Lee was found guilty by a jury and the judge sentenced him to 14 years behind bars for two counts of robbery.

He was also sentenced for six months, to run concurrently, for a burglary after he pleaded guilty to breaking into a shed at the same property back in May 2018.
