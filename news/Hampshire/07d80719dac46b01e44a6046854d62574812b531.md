We are appealing for witnesses, dash cam or CCTV footage, following a robbery at a McColl's store in Fareham last week.

Police were called around 3pm on Friday, August 3, to a report of two men entering the store and demanding staff hand over money from the till.

Both men are described as being between 18 and 25 years old, around 5ft 10ins tall and wearing tracksuits and face coverings.

They were also wearing distinctive yellow rubber gloves.

After taking money, the pair left the store, and were seen fleeing along Bishopsfield Road, before people lost sight of them in Consiton Walk.

Officers investigating the incident are keen to speak with anyone who may have information that will assist them.

We are particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have dash cam footage or private CCTV from the area between 2.30pm and 3.30pm on Friday.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200298609. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
