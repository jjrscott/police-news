Six youths appeared before Basingstoke Magistrates Court on Friday (May 29), charged in connection with a public order incident in Buckskin.

The incident occurred at around 10pm on May 25 outside a fast food store at the Buckskin Centre, Blackdown Close, Basingstoke.

Five juveniles have been charged with affray and appeared at court on Friday. They are two 15 year olds, two 16 year olds and a 17 year old, all from Basingstoke. None can be named for legal reasons.

Joseph-Alan Naisbitt, 19, of Rectory Road, Hook, is also charged with affray and appeared alongside them.

All six have been bailed with conditions to re-appear at Basingstoke Magistrates Court on July 23.

Police Sergeant Ian Davies said: "We want to reassure the community that we won't tolerate disorder. We need the community to let us know if they see anti social behaviour happening by calling 101 and quoting Operation Witch.

"If an incident or a crime is happening there and then, always call 999."
