The family of a man who sadly died after his motorcycle collided with traffic lights in Southampton have today paid tribute to him.

We were called at 7.30am on Thursday 11 June to a report of a collision involving a black and white Lexmoto Milano motorcycle at the junction of Shirley Road and Waterloo Road.

Paul Prince, 61, of Mendip Road, Southampton, was taken to hospital, but he was pronounced dead a short while later.

Paying tribute to him today, his family said: "Paul was a family man who lived for his wife, children and grandchildren and a central figure to his beloved scooter club.

"He always followed his dreams and never gave up on anyone or anything and has left behind a legacy that will be honoured by all who knew and loved him.

"He will always be in our hearts and we will all love and remember him forever."

Officers are continuing to investigate the exact circumstances of the collision.

They remain keen to speak with anyone who witnessed the collision, or who may have captured dash cam footage.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200209847.
