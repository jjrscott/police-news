Do you recognise anyone from this image?

We've released this e-fit image after a dog walker was assaulted by a man in Basingstoke.

The 25-year-old woman was out walking her dog in the St James Park estate on March 13, when she was grabbed from behind.

It happened at around 8.30pm, on the footpath that runs behind The Bramley Inn.

She suffered scratches to her neck and chest. Her dog bit the man and he fled.

Investigations have been ongoing and now we can release this e-fit in that hope that someone may recognised somebody from it.

If you think you can help, call us on 101, quoting 44200095863, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
