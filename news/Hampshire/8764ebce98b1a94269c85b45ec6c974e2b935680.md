Do you know a teenager with stretcher style earrings in both ears who has recently received a facial injury?

We are looking to trace someone of this description in connection with an attempted robbery of a dog walker in Basingstoke on Tuesday, March 10.

The incident occurred between 11.30am and 11.45am on the gravel footpath that runs from Pack Lane to Kestrel Road. The path is known locally as 'Yellow Brick Road'.

The 44 year old woman was walking her black Great Dane on the path when two male teenagers approached and asked her to hand over her mobile phone.

When she refused, one of the youths grabbed her and tried to push her into a bush.

The victim's dog has then jumped up at the male and is believed to have caused injuries to the suspect's face.

The first suspect is described as being aged around 16-17 years of age, with silver earrings in both ears, designed to stretch the hole - so very distinctive.

He is approximately six foot tall, of slim build and was wearing a grey hoody with the hood up and baggy trousers.

The second suspect is also described as around the same age, height and build but was wearing a black puffer jacket and a black baseball cap.

Both suspects were seen to enter the gravel path from the direction of Pack Lane before leaving in the direction of Kestrel Road.

If you recognise this description or if you were in the vicinity and saw anything suspicious, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting 44200090591.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
