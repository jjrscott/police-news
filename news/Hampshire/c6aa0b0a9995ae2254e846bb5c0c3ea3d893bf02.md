We are appealing for witnesses and information following a robbery at the Co-op in Warren Gardens, Romsey.

Two young males dressed in black clothes entered the store between 1.50pm and 2pm on Thursday, 31 October. One is described as being aged between 14 and 17 years old, around five foot nine inches tall and of proportionate build.

One bought an item, and whilst the till was open the second went behind the till, pushed a member of staff out of the way and stole approximately Â£600 in cash.

The staff member was uninjured during this incident.

The suspects then left the store on foot. One ran off opposite the car park, and the other turned right towards the park area.

If you have any information about this incident, please call us on 101, quoting 44190390831.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
