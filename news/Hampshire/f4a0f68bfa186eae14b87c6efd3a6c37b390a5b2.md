Do you recognise this man?

We realise most of his face is covered but we are keen to identify this man after a robbery at a Premier Store in Valentine Avenue last month.

The man entered the shop just before 10am on December 19 and approached the counter with a knife in his hand and demanded money.

Staff refused to give him money and he fled the store again.

Officers investigating are keen to identify the man in this image, who was wearing a distinctive grey hoodie, with writing on the front, and had a black bag with several images of skulls on it.

He is described as being white, around 6ft tall and between the ages of 20 and 35.

Do you recognise the clothing or the bag in these images?

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44190455086. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
