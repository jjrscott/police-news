We are appealing for witnesses after a robbery in Petersfield yesterday, Thursday 22 January.

The victim, an 18-year-old man from Petersfield, was walking on The Causeway at around 2.20am when he was approached by two men.

The men then forcibly stole two rings, and an Urban Outfitters bag containing various personal items before making off on foot.

Both suspects are described as being white, aged around 18-years-old, roughly 5ft 10ins tall and of medium build. Both were wearing black face coverings, and dressed in dark clothing with hoods up.

Officers investigating are now releasing images of the stolen items in an effort to identify and locate the suspects.

Do you recognise any of the items pictured? They are described as:
• A silver ring with a thick metal band, the underside of the ring is plain and top is decorated with a variety of crystals. The band is approximately a centimetre and a half in width
• A silver eternity ring, with crystals around the top of the band. The ring is quite thin.
• An Urban Outfitters shoulder bag with two black handles, with a white UO motif in the middle of the bag. Inside was a white, metal water bottle with black writing, a tobacco pouch and purple lighter, and Apple Airpods in a white silicone case.

Were you in the area at the time? Perhaps you saw two men matching the above descriptions?

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 with the reference 44210023459. Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
