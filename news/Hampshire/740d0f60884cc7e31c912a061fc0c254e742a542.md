Tribute has been paid to a mum-of-three who died following a collision in Southampton last month.

Kim Bainbridge, 51, of Buckthorn Close, Totton, was the passenger of a car involved in a single vehicle collision on Mountbatten Way, on June 30.

Today her family have paid tribute to her. They said: "Three boys have been left absolutely heartbroken following the tragic loss of their mother and her friends have been left distraught.

"Kim will always be remembered in the hearts of us all. She had a huge influence on many lives and she was a happy-go-lucky person, always cheering everyone up.

"She lived her life to the full and had nothing but love, kindness and humour in her heart and soul."

Investigations into the exact circumstances of the collision are ongoing.

The driver of the BMW 3 series, a 32-year-old man, from Totton, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and failing to provide a specimen for analysis. He has been released from custody but remains under investigation.
