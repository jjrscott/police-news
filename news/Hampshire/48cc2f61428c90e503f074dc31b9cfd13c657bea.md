Following a thorough investigation into the death of Sol Hemy on September 5, 2019, where Sol's body was found in the water at Riverside Park officers are now in a position to provide an update.

A 28-year-old man from Gosport arrested on suspicion of murder, will have no further action taken against him.

A file on the circumstances surrounding Sol's death has been prepared for the Coroner.

Sol's next of kin have been informed regarding this update.

A 28-year-old man from Gosport will appear in court later in the year to face a charge of dangerous driving following being served with a postal requisition.

A post mortem examination concluded that the cause of Sol's death was by drowning.
