We're appealing for witnesses following a serious assault that took place in Southampton.

The incident happened at around 7.40pm in Didcot Road, Southampton on Tuesday, 10 March.

Two cars pulled up in the street and a group of men got out of both vehicles.

The men then approached a pedestrian and seriously assaulted him before getting back in their cars and driving off.

The injured man remains in hospital with serious, yet not life threatening injuries.
