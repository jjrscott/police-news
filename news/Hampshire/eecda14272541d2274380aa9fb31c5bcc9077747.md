Magistrates have issued a closure order on 25 June for a residential address in Sherwood Road, Gosport, that had been linked to County Lines drug supply.

A warrant and a search carried out at the address by police resulted in the discovery of drugs, as well as replica firearms and a knuckle duster. The discoveries resulted in a number of arrests.

The actual tenant of the address has since been successfully rehomed.

The order lasts for three months and means that it is a criminal offence for anyone to enter the property, unless authorised by the police, during that period.

Sergeant Katie Clift, from Gosport Central Neighbourhood Team, said: "I hope this closure reassures the local community that we will not tolerate drug supply and other drug-related offending in our communities, and we will do everything within our power to stop it.

"Searches at the address found clear evidence of criminal activity which was having a negative impact on the quality of life local residents who had raised concerns to us.

"We are pleased that the tenant has now found suitable accommodation, and I would like to thank the members of the community who were brave enough to assist us in our investigation.

"I am also grateful to PCSO Tracy Burton and the local team whose persistence and desire to improve the lives of those in Sherwood Road made this closure order possible.

"If you are concerned about drug supply in your area, please call your local Neighbourhood Policing Team on 101."
