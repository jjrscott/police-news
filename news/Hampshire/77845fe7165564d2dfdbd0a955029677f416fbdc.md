A man has been jailed for four years and four months after pleading guilty to burglary and fraud offences.

Michael Dorward, aged 43, of no fixed address _,_ pleaded guilty to three burglaries in Southampton in March and May 2019 and four fraud offences - use of stolen bank card - in May 2019.

He was sentenced on 14 February at Southampton Crown Court to 52 months in prison.

The burglaries took place as follows:

 * Wilton Avenue, 29-30 March 2019
 * Norfolk Road, 3 May 2019
 * Wilton Avenue, 8 May 2019

PC Charlie Buckingham from the Operation Hawk team said:

"Dorward was identified through DNA evidence at two of the scenes and CCTV footage.

"We were able to track him on council CCTV leaving the area of the third burglary on his getaway vehicle, a green girls' bike with a basket.

"We then recovered footage of him using the stolen bank card within a short time of the burglary offence.

"Dorward would smash glass in the front doors to gain entry and then search the entire premises, stealing jewellery, laptop computers, iPads and games consoles. No property has ever been recovered.

"We are delighted that this prolific burglar is now behind bars."
