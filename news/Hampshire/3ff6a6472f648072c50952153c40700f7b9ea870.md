Officers investigating a report of a vehicle being stolen in Totton have arrested a man in connection.

The incident occurred just before 9pm on Tuesday 16 March outside of a property on Maple Gardens, Totton.

A vehicle was up for sale and was being viewed by a prospective buyer. They'd asked the owner to start the engine and it was at this point that the vehicle was stolen from the property.

Officers from Hampshire Constabulary's ARV unit, supported by Response and Patrol officers, located a silver BMW which was seen following the stolen vehicle after fleeing the scene.

They took a proactive approach and attended the registered owners home address of the BMW and located both vehicle outside the property.

A 20-year-old man from Southampton was arrested on suspicion of taking a motor vehicle without the owner's consent.

He remains in custody at this time.
