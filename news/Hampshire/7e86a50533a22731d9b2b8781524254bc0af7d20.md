A man was sentenced yesterday (19 May) to 17 years in jail having been found guilty of non-recent child sex offences.

Stephen Lea, 53, of Logan Close, Southampton was found guilty of one count of rape and 13 counts of indecent assault on a child, following a trial at Southampton Crown Court.

The court heard that Lea began abusing his young victim in 1994 and continued until 1999.

Lea's offences were reported to the police after the victim disclosed what had happened to a relative.

Lea was sentenced to 17 years, with an extended licence period of one year. He was also made subject of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO) and ordered to be placed on the Sex Offenders Register for life.

Detective Constable Marie Leather from Hampshire Constabulary's Amberstone team said "Lea's offending took place over a prolonged period of time.

 "I cannot praise the victim enough for the bravery and courage she has shown in reporting what happened. Lea's actions have had a significant impact on her and it has been something she has been trying to come to terms with throughout her life.

"I hope this sentence goes some way in helping her move forward.

"I also hope this sentence will encourage others who have suffered this type of abuse, no matter when it happened, to come forward and speak to us. We take allegations of this nature extremely seriously and work hard to bring offenders to justice."
