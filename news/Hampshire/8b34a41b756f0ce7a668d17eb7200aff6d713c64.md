Do you recognise these men? We would like to speak to them in connection with an incident where a shopper was targeted for theft in a supermarket car park.

The incident occurred at around 10.30am on October 19 in the car park at Aldi in London Road, Camberley.

The 70 year old lady was approached by a man who used a map to distract her while she was unpacking shopping in her boot. It is believed a second man then went to the front of the car and stole her purse.

If you recognise these men or have any information about this crime, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44190374588.

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
