Officers are appealing for information after a woman was robbed in Southampton.

At around 7.15pm on Thursday, 5 December a 40-year-old woman was walking along Richmond Road when she was approached from behind by the offender. The man wrestled her bag away from her and made off with her belongings.

The victim suffered a broken finger during the incident.

The bag, which is described as a leather satchel with flaps over the pockets, fastened down by two buckles, is worth £200\. Items inside the bag include: an IBM Thinkpad laptop worth £700, bank cards, a note pad, two mini diaries, a denim blue leather purse with a metal grey hound image on it, a driving licence, £30 cash, a Samsung phone and keys.

The man police want to speak to is described as: white, aged 30 to 39, 5ft 11ins, of average build and with shaggy mousey brown hair. He was dressed in dark coloured clothing.

Officers are appealing for anyone with information about this incident to come forward. Did you see the offender in the area or have you found any of the stolen items discarded nearby?
