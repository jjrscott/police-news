Can you help us identify these two people?

Officers want to speak with them in connection with a serious assault in Kingsbury Road.

We are also appealing for any witnesses, further CCTV footage or dash cam footage from the area.

At around 4.45pm yesterday, Friday 5 March, a 30-year-old man was found with a stab wound in Kingsbury Road.

The man was taken to hospital where he remains with serious injuries.

Investigations are ongoing and officers are keen to speak with anyone who may be able to assist with our enquiries.

In particular, we want to speak with the people in these CCTV images.

Both boys are described as being in their late teens and white.

One, in the image on the left, is described as being skinny and tall, with brown/ginger curly hair and was wearing grey.

The other, in the image on the right, is described as being the younger of the two and was wearing black.

We know the images aren't the clearest, but hope that someone may recognise something about either of the two in them.

Officers also want to hear from anyone else who could assist.

Were you in the Kingsbury Road area at around the time of the incident? Did you see or hear anything? Do you have any private CCTV or dash-cam footage?

Anyone with information is asked to call us on 101, quoting 44210083242.

Alternatively people can call the charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or online at https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
