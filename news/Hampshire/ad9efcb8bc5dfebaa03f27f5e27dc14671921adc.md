Jake Spiers, aged 29 years-old, of Landguard Road, Southampton was jailed for four and a half years on Thursday, 23 January for robbery and shoplifting.

Spiers pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery and admitted two charges of shoplifting at Southampton Crown Court on 16 December.

Just after 10.15am on 6 November, Spiers walked into Foyes News on Shirley Road holding a rucksack. He put his hand in the rucksack and threatened a member of staff saying he had a gun and demanded cash from the till. He took a quantity of cash and left the store.

Two days later, just before midnight on Friday, 8 November, Spiers entered Retro Burger on Waterloo Road holding a carrier bag. Again, he put his hand inside the carrier bag and said he had a gun and demanded cash. A member of staff gave him an envelope containing Â£10 and he left the store.

No-one was hurt in either incident.

Spiers pleaded guilty to two shoplifting offences that took place at John Lewis on Sunday, 13 October and Friday, 8 November during which he stole an Amazon Echo Dot and a heated mattress cover.

He also admitted to another robbery and two further shoplifting offences which were taken into consideration when being sentenced.
