We are appealing for witnesses after reports of a man indecently exposing himself in Waterlooville.

The incident occurred on Wednesday (7 October) at around 1.30pm, on Purbrook Way at the roundabout with Stakes Hill Road.

As a woman was approaching the railings by the subway she saw a man exposing and inappropriately touching himself.

He is described as being white, between 5ft 5ins and 6ft tall, average to chubby build, with blonde hair.

He was wearing a black hooded top, black tracksuit bottoms, and glasses.
