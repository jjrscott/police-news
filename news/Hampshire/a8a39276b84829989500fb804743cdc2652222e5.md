We are appealing for witnesses, or anyone with information, to come forward after a firearm incident in Yateley.

We were called just after 3.30pm on Tuesday 16 March to reports of a firearm being discharged at a black Mercedes on Reading Road at the junction with Darby Green Road.

Two men were in the Mercedes, however no one was injured in the incident. The offenders were in a black Fiat 500.

Shortly afterward, at around 3.40pm a firearm was heard to be discharged in the area of Croft Lane, Yateley.

A 21-year-old man from Ash Vale has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and possession of a firearm. He remains in custody at this time.

We would ask that anyone with information, or CCTV footage, that could help our investigation phone 101 with the reference 44210098347.

Additional patrols are being conducted in the area, however there is no known risk to the wider community at this time. If you have any concerns please come and talk to one of our officers.
