We are appealing for witnesses after a man suffered a fractured skull and fractured cheekbone following an altercation in Ringwood at the weekend.

The incident is believed to have occurred outside the Nationwide Bank in the High Street between 11.50pm on Saturday, August 24 and 12.06am on August 25.

The 21 year old victim was allegedly punched in the face causing the injuries, which are being investigated as grievous bodily harm. He was taken to hospital where he required surgery for his injuries.

A second man, aged 20, was also punched in the face by the same suspect but did not sustain any injury.

There were a lot of people in the area at the time of the incident and officers are asking anyone who hasn't already spoken to police, to come forward. They would particularly like to speak to anyone who may have videoed the incident.

If you can help, please call 101, quoting reference 44190301951. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

A 19 year old man from Bransgore, has been arrested in connection with the incident and has been bailed.
