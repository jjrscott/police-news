Three men have been arrested following a public order incident in Southampton.

We were called just before 8.30pm, yesterday evening (5 July), to a report of a public order incident in St Marys Street, Southampton.

It was reported that a large group of people were fighting in the street.

A 17-year-old girl was taken to Southampton General Hospital and has since been discharged.

Officers attended and arrested three men aged 22, 26 and 55, all from Southampton, on suspicion of public order offences.

All three remain in custody at this time.

Officers will be in the area today continuing with their enquiries. If you have any concerns, please don't hesitate to speak to our officers.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information should call us on 101, quoting 44200247049
