We are appealing for witnesses after an attempted child abduction in Basingstoke.

The incident happened at around 4pm yesterday, February 4, near to Eastrop Park.

A 25-year-old woman was walking with her 2-year-old daughter in a pushchair when they were approached by an unknown man.

The man has begun speaking with the woman, before trying to take the girl out of the pushchair.

The man is described as being black, around 40-years-old, 5ft 6ins with a stocky build, with black hair and a thick beard and moustache. He was described as wearing a white mask, a royal blue puffa jacket, grey jeans, and white trainers.

Officers investigating this incident are keen to speak with anyone who could have information.

Were you in the area at the time, perhaps you saw or heard something? Do you recognise the man in this description?

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 with the reference 44210043340.

Alternatively, you can phone Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
