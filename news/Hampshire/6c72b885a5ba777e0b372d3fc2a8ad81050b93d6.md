The family of a man who sadly died following a single-vehicle collision last Friday night (July 10) in Havant have today paid tribute to him.

We were called just after 9pm to a report of a collision involving a grey Morgan Plus Four and a lamppost in Portsdown Hill Road.

Sadly, Andrew Biddlecombe, 70, of West Street, Havant, was pronounced dead at the scene.

Today, his family have paid tribute to him.

They said: "Andrew had recently celebrated his 70th birthday with his family and three children, who he loved very much.

"Known as a kind, calm and patient man, he will be greatly missed by his friends and family."

Officers are continuing to investigate the exact circumstances of the collision and are keen to speak to anyone with information which may assist them.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200255290.
