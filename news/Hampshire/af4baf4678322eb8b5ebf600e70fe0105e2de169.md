We are appealing for witnesses and information after a 13 year old girl was grabbed by a man with grey hair and a long beard in woodland in Hedge End.

The incident occurred between 2pm and 2.30pm on April 1. The girl had been walking in Telegraph Woods in Telegraph Road, and stopped to sit on a log.

The man, who is described as looking like a 'biker', came and sat beside her. When she got up to go, he grabbed around the waist and touched her bottom.

She was able to elbow him away and ran home. The man is described as a white male, wearing a black leather jacket, around five feet eight tall, of large build, with grey hair and a long beard.

We are appealing to anyone who has information about this incident or who might have seen someone matching this description in the vicinity of the woods.

Please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200117420.

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
