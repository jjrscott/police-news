A woman arrested in connection with the murder of Louise Smith in Leigh Park will have no further action taken against her.

Louise, aged 16, was reported missing on Friday 8 May, before her body was found in Havant Thicket on Thursday 21 May.

A decision has been made that a 29-year-old woman, who has previously been arrested on suspicion of murder and assisting an offender, will now face no further action.

Officers previously charged Shane Lee Mays, aged 29 years and from Somborne Drive in Havant, on suspicion of murder. His trial is due to take place at Winchester Crown Court on 16 November.

Detective Chief Superintendent Scott MacKechnie said: "We understand these sorts of updates can come as a shock to the local community, but please be reassured that we are continuing to investigate this case thoroughly, and this will form part of the ongoing court process in relation to the suspect we have charged.

"It is important we keep you updated with these developments, and we thank the community for their ongoing support and understanding.

"We also once again ask that you don't speculate on the circumstances surrounding Louise's death as this can have an impact on proceedings later down the line when evidence is presented to a jury."
