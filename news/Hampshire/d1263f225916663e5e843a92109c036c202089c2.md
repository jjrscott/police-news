An 18-year-old man from Lymington has been jailed for 30 months after admitting to a number of charges in relation to drug offences in the New Forest.

Thomas Dickie, of The Square, Pennington in Lymington pleaded guilty to two counts of importing a controlled Class B drug, one count of possession with intent to supply a Class B drug, two counts of being concerned in the supply of a Class B drug, one count of possession of a Class C drug and one count of receiving stolen goods.

Southampton Crown Court heard yesterday (16 March) how Dickie imported a large quantity of cannabis into the UK from the USA on Saturday 23 May 2020; yet this was intercepted by the UK Border Force.

Officers obtained a Section 23 Misuse of Drugs Act and a warrant executed at his property. Officers located a quantity of cannabis as well as a quantity of cash - all of which was seized as a result. A number of mobile phones were also seized and forensically examined, whereby evidence was gathered linking him to drug dealing.

Thomas Dickie pleaded guilty to these offences and was handed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment on Tuesday 17 March.
