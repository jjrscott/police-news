A 44 year old man who was arrested on suspicion of the attempted murder of a Hampshire police officer, is due to appear before Basingstoke Magistrates Court in December.

Thomas Gracey, of Littlemore, Oxfordshire, is accused of attempting to murder an officer, who is in his 20s, following an incident in Churchill Way, Basingstoke at around 4.30pm on April 12.
