We are appealing for anyone who has information about a suspicious incident that happened in Winchester at the weekend.

At around 11.45pm on Saturday 8 February two men rang the doorbell at an address in Kilham Lane.

The men have told the residents that they were the police and they needed to go into the address. The resident told the men he would phone the police and the men then ran away.

One of the men was dressed in a high-visibility jacket with 'Police' written on it. The other wore a dark jacket. However neither were actually police officers.

We would like to take this opportunity to remind you of our advice when answering the door to somebody you do not know.

Public service employees are required to show identity cards when they come to your home. Examine the card carefully as fake cards have been used.

The card should have a photograph and the name of the organisation. If you are at all worried, ring the organisation to check the caller is genuine. Don't phone the number printed on the identity card, a genuine worker won't mind waiting.

Ensure your back door is locked if you are answering the front door to someone you don't know, and make sure to keep side gates, garage doors, and sheds locked.

Anyone with information about this incident can call 101 quoting 44200049896. If you think a bogus caller has been to your home, call the police on 999.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
