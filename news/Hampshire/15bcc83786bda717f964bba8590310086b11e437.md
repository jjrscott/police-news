Do you recognise these people?

We'd like to speak to them as part of an investigation into a theft at Calshot Activity Centre.

It took place between 3am and 3.55am on Monday 28 October.

Four people were captured on CCTV walking around the boat yard before using a wheelbarrow to steal an outboard engine.

The persons captured on CCTV have been described as three men and one woman.

If you recognise these people or have any information please call us on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44190385843.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
