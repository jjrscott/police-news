We are appealing for witnesses following a serious road traffic collision in Titchfield this morning which has left a motorcycle rider with life threatening injuries.

The rider of the motorcycle, a man, came off his bike on the St Margaret's Roundabout at 5.50am today (July 28).

A dark coloured vehicle, believed to be involved in a collision with the bike, left the scene and we would like the driver of that vehicle to contact us.

The man has been taken to hospital.

To allow us to deal with the incident, the westbound carriage way between Titchfield Gyratory and St Margaret's Roundabout was closed.

We would like to appeal to anyone who may have seen what happened this morning, to make contact with us.

We are specifically looking to identify the driver of the vehicle the bike was believed to be in collision with, described as dark coloured car.

If you were on this stretch of road early this morning, witnessed anything, or have dash cam footage that may be able to assist us, please get in touch.

Call 101 and quote 44200282097.
