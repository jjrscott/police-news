We're appealing for witnesses after two plain clothed police officers were assaulted in Southampton.

The incident happened at around 4.45pm on Saturday, 14 December next to the underpass at Kingsway Road and New Road.

Two plain clothed officers who were on patrol at the time, witnessed a man punch another to the face.

Having approached the man to try and detain him, they were pushed to the ground by a group of men and assaulted.

One of the officers received an eye injury and the other suffered bruising and swelling to the head.

One man was arrested and questioned by officers. He has since been released under investigation to allow for further enquiries.

Investigating officer, PC Paul Cardy said "This assault happened just before the football match between Southampton and West Ham so there would have been hundreds of people in the area at the time.

"Did you see what happened?"

If you have any information please call 101 quoting 44190449249.

Alternatively people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
