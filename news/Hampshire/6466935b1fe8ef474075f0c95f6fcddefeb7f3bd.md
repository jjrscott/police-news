Have you seen this motorbike and bike helmet recently?

If so, you may be able to help with our investigation into a house burglary in Woodlands Road, Woodlands.

It took place around 1.15pm on Monday 4 November.

A man on a motorbike was seen to arrive at the house and knock on the front door. Entry to the house was then gained by smashing a patio door to the rear of the house.

A search was made of the house and camera equipment stolen.

The man was described as wearing a dark motorcycle jacket, with a red, white and black helmet.

The number plate on the motorbike may be linked to a different vehicle. Our enquiries are ongoing.

We have released a CCTV image of a man we would like to identify as part of our investigation.

Do you recognise this motorbike helmet? Perhaps you have seen it recently? Or does the bike look familiar to you?

If so, we would like to hear from you.

Please call us on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44190395610.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
