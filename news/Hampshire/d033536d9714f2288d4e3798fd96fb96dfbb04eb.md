Officers investigating the theft of a moped in Portsmouth are appealing for help identifying these men.

The 2012-plate white Yamaha moped was parked on the street in Londesborough Road, Southsea, when it was stolen between midnight and 7am on December 29.

Just after 9.45am the vehicle was then seen being ridden around Clarence Pier, before the rider stopped to speak with two men.

All three then got onto the moped and rode off towards Old Portsmouth.

Since then, officers have made a number of enquiries and are now in a position to release CCTV images of the men they wish to speak to in connection with this incident.

While the rider is in a black helmet in the image, he is described as being white, between the ages of 15 and 17 and around 5ft 8ins tall.

Do you recognise any of the men in this image? Maybe someone you know has recently started riding around on a Yamaha moped?

Or perhaps you remember seeing three men riding on a mope on December 29?

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44190465120. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
