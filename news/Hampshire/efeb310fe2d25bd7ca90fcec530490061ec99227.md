A man has been jailed for 12 years after being found guilty of carrying out an aggravated burglary in Romsey.

Antony Agnew, 29, was sentenced at Southampton Crown Court on Friday 4 September, following a three-day trial.

The court heard that Agnew and another man forced their way into a house in Riverside Gardens, Romsey, at around 6.45pm on November 6, 2018.

Agnew, armed with a metal pole, threatened a 24-year-old man and his 57-year-old mother, before taking more than Â£3,000 in cash, the jury heard. The offenders then left the house.

The man sustained minor injuries in the incident.

The court heard that Agnew was being monitored electronically at the time of the incident as he was on licence for a previous burglary conviction.

He was identified for the Romsey offence by one of the victims and data from his electronic monitoring tag.

Agnew, of Birch Close, Southampton, was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment. He was also handed an indefinite restraining order not to contact the victims.

Detective Constable Chris Orr said: "This was a concerning incident which has had a significant impact on the victims.

"Agnew faced trial for this offence back in January this year, but it went to a retrial when the jury could not reach a verdict.

"It means that not only have the victims had to go through the ordeal of what happened that evening, they have also had to relive their experience twice at trial. They have shown great courage throughout."
