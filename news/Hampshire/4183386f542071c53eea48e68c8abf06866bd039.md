Officers have released two CCTV images of men they want to speak to following a distraction burglary in Southsea.

At around 9.35am on Monday, 14 October two men knocked on the door of a property on Warren Avenue. When the door was answered they told the resident, who is aged in her early 70s, that some work needed doing in the garden.

Both men walked past the woman, and in to the property. When the woman challenged them one of the men said he had a medical condition and needed to use the toilet.

He then went upstairs for approximately ten minutes before returning and leaving the property with the other man.

The woman then went upstairs to find Â£1,300 in cash was missing from her bedroom.

PC Peter Kurton, said: "We're appealing for anyone who recognises these men to come forward and speak to us.

"This incident only happened yesterday, and it may be that other residents in the area were approached in a similar way but have not yet made contact with us.

"We would urge anyone with information to contact us as soon as possible."

Anyone with information should call Hampshire Constabulary on 101 quoting 44190367596.
