We're investigating after a man died in a motorcycle crash in the early hours of the morning, today, Sunday November 8 on the Isle of Wight.

Our officers were called around 1.15am to the crash on Green Street near it's junction with the High Street by the St Johns Road traffic lights in Ryde. The roads are closed in the area and diversions have been put in place. It is likely to be several hours until they are lifted.

The motorcycle crashed into the corner of a launderette in Green Street - it's not believed at this stage that any other vehicle was involved.

The man, who had been riding an orange Kawasaki motorbike, was taken to St Mary's Hospital in Newport but died of his injuries.

Officers from our Roads Policing Unit are now asking for anyone who witnessed the incident or saw the motorcyclist shortly before the crash to contact them. They'd also like to hear from anyone who has CCTV or dashcam footage of the incident to get in touch.

They are asked to call 101 quoting reference 44200432908.
