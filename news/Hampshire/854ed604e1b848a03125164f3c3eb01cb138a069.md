Officers have released CCTV images of a young man they want to speak to following a suspicious incident in Sherborne St John, Basingstoke.

At around 11.05pm on Saturday, 6 July a young man, wearing a hooded top, approached the door of an address on Cranes Road and repeatedly rang the doorbell.

Other people were heard making noises and hiding behind the fence.

This continued for about ten minutes.

PC Simon Denton, said: "This incident has caused much distress to the woman who was at home at the time of the incident.

"The CCTV images are a little blurry but we're confident that if you know this person, you'd recognise him from these images. If you have any information please call us on 101 quoting 44190235401."
