We are appealing for witnesses to a burglary at a Currys store in Farnborough last night.

The shop was broken into between 11.45pm last night (October 31) and 7.30am today.

Once inside, the offenders removed a large number of electrical goods, including televisions and games consoles.

It is believed these were taken to a waiting white van, which had been parked close to the store on the A331 just prior to the junction for Farnborough Gate.

PC Thomas Whittle said: "We would like to hear from anyone who witnessed people acting suspiciously around the Currys store between these hours.

"We would also like to speak to anyone who travelled on the A331, particularly between 7.20am and 7.30am this morning (November 1).

"Did you see a white van or have you got dashcam footage you can send to us?"

Anyone with information should contact police on 101, quoting 44190391719.

Alternatively, you can call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
