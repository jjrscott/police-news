Abdelaziz El Yechioui Ourzat, aged 29, of King George's Avenue, Southampton has been charged with the murder of 28-year-old Cristina Ortiz-Lozano.

Cristina's body was found at her home address on Spear Road, Southampton, just before 10pm on Saturday 21 September.

She had suffered multiple stab wounds.

Abdelaziz El Yechioui Ourzat will appear before Southampton Magistrates Court tomorrow (October 2) charged with her murder.

Bernadette Kearney, senior lawyer for the Crown Prosecution Service said: "Following a careful review of the evidence provided to me by Hampshire Police I have authorised the police to charge Abdelaziz El Yechioui Ourzat, 29, from Southampton with the murder of Cristina Ortiz-Lozano, 28.

"The Crown Prosecution Service reminds all concerned that criminal proceedings against the defendant are now active and that he has the right to a fair trial.

"It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings."
