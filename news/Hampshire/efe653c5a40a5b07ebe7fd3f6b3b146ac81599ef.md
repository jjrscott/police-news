We are appealing for witnesses following a road traffic collision at Wickham.

The collision took place at around 6pm on Saturday 7 December on B2177 at Hundred Acres.

It involved three vehicles - a grey Mazda MX-5 and a grey Volkswagen Passat, both travelling eastbound, and a blue Volkswagen Golf travelling westbound.

Officers attended. Five people were taken to Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth for treatment. A sixth person involved in the collision later attended the hospital for treatment.

None of the injuries have been described as life-threatening, however, one of those injured, a 10-year- old girl, sustained serious injuries.

An investigation into the collision is underway. No arrests have been made.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you see what happened?

Anyone with information should call us on 101, quoting the reference number 44190440518.
