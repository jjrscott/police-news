Officers investigating a serious assault on Roman Way, Andover, are appealing for witnesses.

We were called to the incident at 10.52pm on Sunday, 29 November, after a 27-year-old man was found with multiple stab wounds.

A second victim, a 35-year-old man, was located on Vespasian Road shortly after. He had also suffered multiple stab wounds.

Both men sustained serious injuries and were taken to Southampton General Hospital for treatment.

A 39-year-old man from Andover was arrested on suspicion of conspiring to cause grievous bodily harm, and a 39-year-old woman, also from Andover, was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.

Both have been released from custody but remain under investigation as enquiries continue.

We are keen to speak with anyone who has information that may help our investigation, and are particularly keen to identify two men we wish to speak to in connection with this incident.

They are described as:
• A white man, aged around 18-years-old, with a skinny build. He was wearing white/beige tracksuit and a thin black jacket, his hood was worn up.
• A black man, aged between 20 and 30-years-old, average build, with plaits in his hair. He was wearing a black coat and carrying a black leather bag.

Were you in the area at the time? Perhaps you recognise these descriptions?

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 with the reference 44200462257.

Officers will continue to be in the area today conducting enquiries, but it is not believed there is any wider risk to the community.
