We are appealing for witnesses after a collision in Havant has left a man in hospital with serious injuries.

The collision took place at around 6pm yesterday (18 May) on Purbrook Way, Leigh Park, between the junctions with Park House Farm Way and the Point Seven roundabout.

A pedestrian was in collision with a green Mini Cooper and a black Mercedes A180.

The pedestrian, a 54-year-old man from Havant, was taken to Southampton General Hospital. His injuries are considered serious but are not life threatening.

Officers investigating the collision are keen to speak with anyone who might be able to assist their enquiries.

Were you in the area at the time? Or perhaps you have dash cam footage showing the moments leading up to the collision?

Anyone with information should call 101, quoting 44200176250.
