We are appealing for witnesses following a serious assault in Southampton on Saturday 5 December.

The incident occurred between 10pm and 10.30pm when a 17-year-old boy was attacked on a footpath next to Archery Road, Weston. Two men approached the victim and demanded his phone, which he was using at the time, and was subsequently assaulted when he refused.

The boy sustained serious injuries to his leg and back during the incident and was taken to Southampton General Hospital.

Officers are now eager to speak to anyone who may have information that may help our investigation, and are particularly keen to identify two men we wish to speak with in connection with this incident.

They are described as:

• A white man, aged 19-20, approximately 6ft tall, stocky build and possibly has a scar on his right cheek. He was seen wearing dark clothing.

• A white boy aged 16-17, approximately 5ft 11", skinny build and possibly had short stubble. He was seen wearing dark clothing.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you perhaps see or hear what happened? Perhaps you recognise these descriptions?

Anyone with information is asked to call us on 101, quoting 44200470416.

Alternatively you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
