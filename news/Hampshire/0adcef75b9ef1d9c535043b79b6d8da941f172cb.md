We're appealing for witnesses and information after receiving a report of a rape of a 15-year-old girl on Southampton Common.

The incident was reported on Sunday 20 December, however the incident happened between 1am and 5am on Saturday 12 December.

The girl is being supported by specially trained officers.

Officers investigating the incident have been carrying out enquiries in the local area and are keen to speak to anyone who was on the Common between 10pm Friday 11 December and 5am Saturday 12 December.

Officers are also conducting CCTV enquiries and would like to hear from anyone who lives on Marshall Square, Barkshire Court, Hulse Road, Northlands Road and Cemetery Lane.

Do you have private CCTV covering any of these locations?

Perhaps you were driving through the area at the time. Did you see anything suspicious, do you have any dash cam footage?

If you can help, please call 101 quoting 44200489775.
