We are supporting our colleagues from Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service this evening as they deal with a fire at Woolton Lodge Gardens, Newbury.

We have closed the road to help ensure they can tackle the fire safely and are assisting with the evacuation of residents from the road as a precaution.

As a result of this incident power supply to local homes might be affected, so we would ask that if you have any problems to contact your energy supplier.

Please follow Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service for further updates.
