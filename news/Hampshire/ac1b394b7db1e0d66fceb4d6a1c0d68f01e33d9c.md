We have released two new images today of a man we would like to speak to in connection with an incident in Winchester where an elderly woman was scammed out of £2,000.

Can you help identify him?

The incident, which occurred at 2.36pm on Thursday 4 June, involved the victim being contacted over the phone by the man purporting to be a police officer from Hammersmith police. He explained to the lady that her bank account had been targeted by fraudsters and that £2,000 had been withdrawn, then re-deposited a short time afterwards.

He encouraged the woman to visit her local bank branch to withdraw the money and coerced her into handing the money over to home at a pre-arranged meeting outside of her home address.

Do you recognise this man? Did you see what happened? Did you see him later that afternoon in the local area or surrounding area?

Anyone with any information about this incident is asked to get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200202099.

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

We want to remind people that a police officer would never call you and ask you for money. No one, not even someone your bank, would call you and ask you for your financial details or ask you to withdraw cash.
