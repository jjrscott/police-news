Officers investigating a series of burglaries in Locks Heath have charged a man.

Andrew Smith, 34, Goldsmith Avenue, Portsmouth, has been charged with four counts of burglary dwelling and theft.

It comes following an investigation by our dedicated burglary team, Operation Hawk.

The burglaries happened in Warsash Road, Alum Way, Brook Lane and St John's Road between April 10 and 11.

Andrew Smith is due to appear at Portsmouth magistrates Court today (April 22).

We hope this news reassures residents in the area that while there is a lot of focus on the important work being done to ensure people are following government restrictions, our officers are continuing their work to tackle crime and make our communities safer. This work never stops.
