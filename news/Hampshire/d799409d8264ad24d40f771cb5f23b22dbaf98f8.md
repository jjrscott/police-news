Can you help us identify these people?

We want to speak to them after items were thrown at police officers and fans after the Carabao Cup football match between Portsmouth and Southampton last year.

The much-anticipated meeting of these two local clubs on September 24 saw the largest ever policing operation deployed in Hampshire for a football match.

In partnership with both clubs, we worked hard to ensure a safe match for all those attending, as well as those living and working close to Fratton Park.

Our priority was to keep people safe and fortunately, as a result of our careful planning, our policing operation achieved that.

Regrettably however, there were a small number of people who were intent on trying to cause disorder as the fans left the stadium.

In Goldsmith Avenue, after the match, we had several reports of items being thrown at police officers and fans. Fortunately, no one was seriously injured.

Since the match our dedicated football officers have been analysing CCTV and footage from the body-worn cameras of officers to investigate the exact circumstances of what happened and ensure those responsible are held accountable for their actions.

We also had a report of a bottle being thrown from the Lower North stand in Fratton Park shortly after the final whistle.

Now we are after your help to identify the people in these images as we believe they can help with our investigations.

Some of the images are not as clear as the others, but we hope that if you know them, they will be good enough. Please scroll through the galleries and take a look.

Detective Chief Inspector John McGonigle said: "We knew the majority of fans wanted to enjoy this match without having to worry about any trouble.

"Sadly, we had to prepare for the potential that a minority would try and ruin it for everyone else and this is what happened in Goldsmith Avenue after the game.

"There were a large number of people in this area at the time who will have no doubt seen others throwing items at our officers and other fans.

"We need to hear from you because we need to work together to ensure these people are held responsible for their actions, so that they cannot put the safety of others at risk again at future matches. They cannot be allowed to ruin the reputation of the genuine fans who simply went to enjoy the game."

He added: "We continue to work closely with both football clubs to prevent violent or aggressive behaviour which simply will not be tolerated at matches.

"If you are found to be committing an offence, we will actively seek the appropriate prosecution. You could also find yourself facing further sanctions from the club.

"If you think you know any of those pictured or if you have any information that can help with our investigation, then please get in touch."

Anyone with information is asked to contact us on 101, quoting **Operation Net 44190307046** , or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
