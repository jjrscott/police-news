We are delighted to let you know that your Tadley Neighbourhood policing team are back home in their newly-refurbished station.

The station in Mulfords Hill has been given a shiny new makeover to improve facilities for the team.

During the four month modernisation, the team were still attending to their local duties and patrols in Tadley as usual but also had a base in Basingstoke.

Responsible for the police estate, the Police and Crime Commissioner's team refurbished the location making it a suitable site for the local policing team to return to.

Neighbourhoods Inspector Hannah Luchesa said: "A lot of work has been done to modernise the station and improve the essential equipment the team need.

"Although we continued to work and patrol in Tadley as before, we are really happy to be home."

As before, the station does not have a public enquiry office but you can visit Basingstoke Police Investigation Centre in Jays Close, Basingstoke.

You can get in touch with the team by calling 101 or by emailing Basingstoke.Rural.Police@hampshire.pnn.police.uk.

You can also get crime prevention advice, read our appeals and report crime online by visiting our website www.hampshire.police.uk.

Or see what our teams are up to on social media via Facebook and Twitter by searching for Basingstoke Cops.

In an emergency, if a crime is happening there and then, always call 999.
