We are appealing for witnesses, or anyone with information, to come forward following a robbery in Netley.

The incident occurred at around 7.50pm on Tuesday 30 March after three men approached another man on Hound Road, at the junction of Osborne Place in Netley.

They threatened the victim with a knife and stole cash from him. They then walked away towards Victoria Country Park.

The victim was not injured.

We would like to speak with the three men in connection with the incident; they are described as all being approximate 6ft tall, slim build and were seen wearing grey hooded tops, tracksuit bottoms and trainers - along with face masks. One of the men also had a black rucksack with them.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you see what happened?

Anyone with information relating to this incident is asked to call 101, quoting 44210121551.

Alternatively, you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
