We are appealing for witnesses after a woman was assaulted at an address on St Mary's Street, Southampton.

We were called at 9.45pm on 14 November to Summers Court, St Mary's Street, after the assault happened in a communal hallway between 8.30pm and 9.45pm.

A 28-year-old man from Southampton was arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He has been released from custody but remains under investigation.

Officers investigating are keen to speak with anyone who might have information that may help their enquiries.

They are particularly keen to hear from a delivery driver believed to have been trying to get into Summers Court at the time of the assault, and people who were potentially outside and may have seen or heard what happened.

Were you in or near the communal hallway between 8.30pm and 9.45pm on 14 November?

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 with reference 44200442052. Alternatively, you can phone Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
