We are appealing for witnesses after a motorcyclist fell from her bike near Alton.

The incident took place at around 3.50pm on Saturday 3 August on the westbound carriageway of the A31, between the Holybourne roundabout and Alton.

The 42-year-old woman was riding a red Ducati motorbike. As she rode, a silver car travelling in the same direction changed lanes, causing her to fall from her bike.

The car failed to stop.

The woman sustained serious but not life threatening injuries and was taken to Southampton General Hospital.

We are making enquiries to establish the exact circumstances of this incident.

We would like to hear from anyone who saw what happened.

Were you driving on the A31 at around this time? Do you remember seeing the two vehicles as described?

Perhaps you have dash cam footage that could assist our investigation?

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the reference number 44190273616.
