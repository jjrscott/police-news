We are warning motorists in Basingstoke to be on their guard after a series of catalytic converter thefts.

Since the beginning of June, we have had 21 offences reported to us. The thefts have been typically happening in the north and centre parts of town and unusually, have been occurring during the day time, often in the afternoon.

Thieves steal catalytic converters for the valuable metals they can contain. Vehicles with a higher chassis are often targeted, as are hybrid vehicles.

We would like to remind people of the following advice to best protect your vehicle:

• Park your car in a locked garage where possible, but if this isn't an option, then park in a well-lit and well-populated area
• If parking in a public car park, consider parking alongside other cars and facing your bonnet towards a wall, if possible
• Avoid parking half on the pavement and half on the road as it makes the underside of your vehicle more accessible
• Look out for people working under cars. If you see anything suspicious, call the police
• If your catalytic converter is 'bolted on', you can have the bolts welded shut
• Consider security lighting and CCTV at home
• Identify/etch your converter with a unique mark or serial number
* Cat clamps - a cage that surrounds your catalytic converter to prevent it being unbolted
* Security lighting/CCTV on your drive or covering your parking space

If you see something you believe to be suspicious, call 101. You can also report online via our website www.hampshire.police.uk.

If you believe a crime is in progress, always call 999.
