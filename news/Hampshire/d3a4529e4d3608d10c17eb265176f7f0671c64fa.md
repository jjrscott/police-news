Officers have carried out a warrant at a home in Andover and made three arrests as part of an investigation into Class A drugs supply.

The warrant was carried out in Dairy Court this morning (Friday 21 August).

Suspected Class A drugs and cash were seized.

A 22-year-old man from London was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a controlled drug of Class A, and acquire/use/possess criminal property.

A 30-year-old man from Andover was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to supply a controlled drug of Class A, and conspiracy to acquire/use/possess criminal property.

Following further enquiries, officers in the Lubeck Drive area arrested a 25-year-old man from Andover on suspicion of conspiracy to supply a Class A controlled drug.

All three men are currently in police custody. Enquiries are ongoing.

Inspector Chris Taylor said: "We are doing all we can to tackle drugs supply and its associated violence in Andover.

"You can help us by telling us what is going on where you live. Anything that is submitted will help us build a better intelligence picture around drugs supply and enable us to target our resources."
