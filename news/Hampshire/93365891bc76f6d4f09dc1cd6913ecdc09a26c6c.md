Officers investigating a number of incidents across Hampshire and Dorset have arrested a man.

The arrest comes as part of a collaborative investigation by both Hampshire Constabulary and Dorset Police, after the offender committed a number of offences in each county.

A 29-year-old man from Christchurch was arrested on Tuesday 14 July by Hampshire Constabulary officers in Dorset on suspicion of assault causing actual bodily harm, following an altercation at a residential property.

The man appeared at West Hampshire Magistrates Court on Friday 17 July and has been remanded until 14 August, where he will appear at Southampton Crown Court.

He was further arrested and charged by Dorset Police for a number of driving offences including failing to provide a specimen for analysis, driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence and driving without valid insurance.

No further action was taken on the charges by Dorset Police.
