Can you help us identify this man?

We want to speak with him in connection with an incident of criminal damage and assault which happened in Stratton Road, Shirley, just after 3pm on Monday 2 November.

It was reported a man had been hitting vehicles with a shovel, causing damage to them. The man is then reported to have approached an 11-year-old boy, demanding he hand over his glasses, before punching him.

The man is described as being:

 * Black
 * Around 5ft 10ins tall
 * Slim build
 * Between 30 and 40 years old
 * Wearing jeans and a hooded top

If anyone recognises this man or can assist with information, they should call 101, quoting the reference 44200425411.
