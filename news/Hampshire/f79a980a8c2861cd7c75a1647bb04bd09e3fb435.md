We're appealing for witnesses after a 19-year-old woman was sexually assaulted in The Stag student union bar, Southampton, between 11pm and 11.30pm on Thursday, 23 January.

The woman was walking out of the toilets when she was approached by a man who grabbed at her arms and neck to try and kiss her.

The woman pushed the man away and went back to her friends.

The man is described as being white, aged around 21-years-old, five feet eleven inches tall, slim with light brown hair. He was wearing a light brown button down shirt.
