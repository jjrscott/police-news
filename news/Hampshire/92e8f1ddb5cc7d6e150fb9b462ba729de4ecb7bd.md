Police officers conducting a proactive stop and search in Eastleigh have arrested two men on suspicion of drug offences.

The incident occurred at around 3pm on Wednesday 3 February when officers stopped a vehicle due to the manner of which it was being driven on Winchester Road, Colden Common.

The driver of the vehicle was required to produce a drug swipe due to the nature of his driving, which was positive for a Class A drug, and was subsequently arrested.

While the passenger of the vehicle was also searched by officers, they located a quantity of Class A drugs and a large quantity of cash. These were subsequently seized, along with a number of mobile phones.

A 26-year-old man from Somborne was arrested on suspicion of driving a vehicle whilst unfit through drugs and possession with intent to supply a Class A drug.

A 28-year-old man from Timsbury was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a Class A drug and possession of a Class C drug.

The two men were released under investigation, pending further police enquiries.
