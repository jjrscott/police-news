We are appealing for information following a report of a public order incident in Eastleigh.

It took place at around 12.50pm on Thursday 7 May, in the queue outside the Tesco Metro in Wells Place.

The victim, a 25-year-old woman, said a woman approached her as she stood in the queue and made a homophobic remark.

The woman then made comments to other people in the queue.

The woman who made the comments is described as having short dark hair, around 5ft 2ins tall, and wore a black coat and grey pyjama bottoms with dark spots.

We are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed this incident.

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the reference number 44200161702.
