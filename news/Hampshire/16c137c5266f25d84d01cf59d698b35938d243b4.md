Updated News Post

We are appealing for witnesses following a fatal collision on the A34 this morning at 4.45am (Tuesday 19 November) whereby a lorry was in collision with a pedestrian.

The collision happened on the northbound carriage way between the A33 split and the A272 junction.

The A34 was closed between the Kingsworthy junction and Three Maids Hill to allow us to carry out enquiries.

The pedestrian, a 19-year-old from Billericay, Essex, was pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin have been informed.

Officers investigating the incident would like to hear from anyone who was travelling along this part of the A34 this morning and witnessed this incident.

Please call 101 and quote reference number 79 of November 19 or Operation Permit.
