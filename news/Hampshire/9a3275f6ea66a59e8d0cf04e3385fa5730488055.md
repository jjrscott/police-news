We are appealing for witnesses after an attempted robbery against a taxi driver in Southampton.

The incident happened just after 5am this morning, 18 February, at the Bevois Road junction with Lodge Road and Portswood Road.

The victim, 49-year-old man, was in his taxi at the traffic lights when he was approached by an unknown man from the car behind him.

He has then assaulted the victim and made demands for his personal items.

Nothing was stolen, and the victim sustained minor injuries.

The suspect is described as being an Asian man, aged in his 40s, wearing dark clothing with a scarf tied around his face. He was also wearing a beanie hat. His car was dark coloured, and possibly a Ford.

Officers have conducted a number of enquiries and are now turning to the public for any information that may help in their investigation.

Were you in the area at the time? Perhaps you have dash cam footage?

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 with the reference 44210060945.
