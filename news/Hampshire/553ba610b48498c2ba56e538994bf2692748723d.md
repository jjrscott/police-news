We are appealing for witnesses and information after two teenagers were assaulted and robbed by a group of males at the Pinehurst Car park in Farnborough.

The incident occurred at around 10pm on Friday, October 23. The victims, both aged 18, had parked up to eat some food on the top floor of the Farnborough Road car park.

They were inside the car when they were approached by around five - seven males in dark clothing and wearing gloves and face coverings.

The suspects threatened them and assaulted both victims. One suspect also caused damage to the car's wing mirror.

The suspects demanded money and other items and then took tobacco off them before the boys managed to drive off.

They both attended hospital with cuts and bruises.

We believe this incident may be linked to a series of robberies and serious assaults on young people in the Fleet and Farnborough areas over the last few days.

Each report states a group of between five to eight young men approached young victims, assaulted them and demand they hand over valuables.

Local neighbourhood officers have increased patrols in the area. If you're concerned or have information that could help us identify those involved, please get in touch.

Do you have any information that may help our investigtation? Please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200413076.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or report anonymously online via Crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information.
