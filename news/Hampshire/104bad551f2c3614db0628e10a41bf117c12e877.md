Seven men who were involved in large scale disorder after the Portsmouth vs Southampton FC Carabao Cup football match last year will be sentenced next month.

Following the match, which took place on 24 September 2019 at Fratton Park, police had to deal with groups of fans acting aggressively, and throwing items at officers and other fans.

The following people were subsequently charged with violent disorder:

 * Cameron Blackman, aged 26 years, from Castle Street in Portchester
 * Michael Foy, aged 34 years, of Station Road in Drayton
 * Jack Halstead, aged 24 years, of Buckland Close in Waterlooville
 * Lewis Harbour, aged 23 years, of Beach Road in Southsea
 * Daniel Marsh, aged 40 years, of Binsteed Road in Fratton
 * Jamie Robb, aged 22 years, of Bemisters Lane in Gosport
 * Jamie Steeves, aged 19 years, of Stubbington Avenue in Portsmouth

Marsh and Robb appeared at Portsmouth Crown Court yesterday (Thursday 10 September) where they admitted the offence.

The other five defendants admitted the offence at previous Magistrates' Court hearings.

All will reappear at Portsmouth Crown Court on 9 October for sentencing.
