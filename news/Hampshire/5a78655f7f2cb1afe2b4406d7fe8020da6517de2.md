We are appealing for witnesses following a report of a robbery at Locks Heath Shopping Village.

At 7.44pm on Thursday 24 October, we were called to a report of a robbery at the Coral bookmakers.

It was reported that a man, wearing a dark coloured balaclava, walked into the store, threatened staff, and then made off with money.

No injuries were reported.

The man was seen to walk from the store, past Waitrose and through the shopping village's car park.

He was described as wearing grey tracksuit bottoms, a white top and black trainers.

Our investigation is at an early stage and officers are in the area making enquiries.

We know that the shopping centre was busy and we are keen to hear from anyone who saw what happened.

Perhaps you remember seeing a man matching the description given? Or maybe you were leaving the centre by car at around this time and have dashcam footage?

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44190381847.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
