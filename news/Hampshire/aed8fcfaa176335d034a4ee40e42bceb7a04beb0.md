Another teenager has been arrested after a 17 year old was injured during an incident at Manor Park in Aldershot at the weekend.

The 19 year old, from Aldershot, was arrested yesterday afternoon (September 14) on suspicion of affray.

He has been released under investigation while police enquiries are ongoing.

A 16 year old boy who was arrested on suspicion of the same offence also remains under investigation.

Officers attended Manor Park following a report of an altercation in the vicinity of the skate park at around 2.15pm on Saturday, September 12.

The victim sustained a laceration to his face and received hospital treatment. His injury is not described as life threatening.

Three other people were arrested on suspicion of affray. Two of them, both 17 years old and from London, have been released with no further action.

A third male, a 17 year old from Kempson, Bedfordshire, will face no further action in relation to the affray but has been released under investigation in relation to alleged possession of cannabis and an offensive weapon.
