We are appealing for witnesses following a collision between a cyclist and Volkswagen Golf on the A27 this morning.

The collision happened just before 5.30am today (December 9) at the junction for the A3M near Bedhampton.

The car collided with the rear of the 30-year-old male cyclist.

He has been taken to Queen Alexandra Hospital with life-threatening head and chest injuries.

We are keen to speak to anyone who was driving on this section of road this morning or who may have dashcam footage.

Officers investigating are particularly keen to speak to the driver of a HGV which we believe was in the vicinity and would have dashcam footage of the incident.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44190442119. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
