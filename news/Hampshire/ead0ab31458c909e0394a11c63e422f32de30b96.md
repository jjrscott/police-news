We are appealing for information after four men forced their way into a home on Belmore Road on Saturday 25 January.

The men, all with their faces covered, entered the property between 9pm and 9.30pm. Once inside they attacked the occupants, a man and a woman, before stealing cash and a Rolex watch.

The group had entered the house via the rear patio doors.

The man, in his 60s, suffered a broken nose and bruising to his face and ribs as a result. The woman did not suffer any physical injuries.

It is possible the four men may have left the scene in a vehicle.

We deployed to the home and conducted a search of the area with a dog unit.

We found one of the victim's mobile phone's discarded in Undershore Road.

The investigation is ongoing.

No one has been arrested at this time.

We would like to speak to anyone who saw a group of four men behaving suspiciously before the incident, particularly in the Belmore Road and Stanford Hill areas between 8.30pm and 9.30pm on Saturday night.

If you saw anything, have private CCTV or dash cam footage, please call 101 and quote 44200031486.
