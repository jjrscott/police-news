We are appealing for witnesses after an assault in Southampton on Tuesday morning (January 7).

A man was assaulted following a minor collision involving a Land Rover and a Vauxhall Astra on Northam Road between 10am and 10.30am.

Following the collision, the driver of the Astra assaulted the driver of the Land Rover, leaving him with serious injuries to his face.

The Astra driver then left the scene before our officers arrived, without leaving any details.

He is described as being black, between 20 and 30-years-old, around 6ft 1ins tall, slim to medium build and with short dark hair.

Officers investigating are keen to speak with anyone who witnessed the assault on Tuesday.

Maybe you have a dash cam in your vehicle and drove past the two vehicles after the collision?

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200007431. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
