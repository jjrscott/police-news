**We are appealing for witnesses and information after a series of incidents in which ball bearing pellets have been used to cause damage to windows and cars across rural Basingstoke.**

** ** **Neighbourhood Inspector Hannah Luchesa said: "We are carrying out a number of enquiries in relation to these incidents but we would appeal to anyone who has seen anything suspicious or who knows who is responsible for these reckless acts, to get in touch.**

** ** **" Unfortunately, a number of the properties have been targeted more than once, which is incredibly distressing for victims.**

** ** **" Luckily no-one has been seriously harmed but it goes without saying that this is incredibly foolish and reckless behaviour and we need to identify those responsible as soon as possible."**

** ** **Police are investigating but would ask if anyone has any information to please come forward.**

** ** **In particular, we would be interested to hear from anyone who may have captured CCTV, doorbell or dash cam footage of anyone acting suspiciously or any suspicious vehicles.**

** ** **If you can help, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44190400887.**

**Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.**

 * **Between 10am on January 2 and 5pm on January 3, the resident of a property on Main Road, Tadley, reported that damage had been caused to the front window, causing one of the double glazed panels to smash.**
 * **Between 5.45am and 6am on January 4, the resident of a property in Dix Hill, Tadley, reported that her exterior wall had been damaged after being struck by a hard object.**
 * **At 3.40pm on January 5, the same lady reported that a hard object had smashed through the upstairs bedroom window while she and her husband were at home. The owner reported that their home had been previously targeted for damage in similar incidents.**
 * **At 2.51pm on January 5, a resident of Aldermaston Road, Pamber End, reported that a hard object had smashed her window. She also reported that damage had been caused to her window on a number of previous occasions.**
 * **Between 3.30pm and 4pm on January 5, a resident reported that the rear window of his Ford Focus had been damaged while it was parked in Aldermaston Road, Pamber Green.**
 * **Between 8pm and 10.49pm on January 5, we received a report that a Mitsubishi Outlander had been damaged while parked in Tadley Hill, Tadley.**
 * **Between 12.30am and 5am on January 6, a resident reported that the rear windscreen of her Vauxhall Meriva had been damaged by a ball bearing, causing it to smash. The vehicle had been parked in Bishopswood Road, Tadley.**
