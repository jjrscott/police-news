You may remember an incident in May 2019 in which a child was injured by a dog at an address on Tennyson Crescent, Waterlooville.

We'd like to update you that a man appeared at Portsmouth Crown Court on Friday 19 February in connection with this incident.

Colin Chapman, aged 41, of Milton Road, Waterlooville, was charged with being the owner/person in charge of a dog dangerously out of control causing serious injury.

He received four months in prison, suspended for 24 months.

He is also disqualified from having custody of a dog for five years.

The child involved has since recovered from their injuries.
