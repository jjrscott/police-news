We are appealing for information after a 48-year-old man was found unconscious with serious injuries in James Street yesterday (Tuesday 9 July) just after 7am.

The man was taken to hospital by ambulance and he remains in hospital in a life threatening condition.

A man that was passing called an ambulance for the injured man after he was prompted by a woman who stopped him and asked him to call for help.

We have identified the man that called for medical assistance and would now like to appeal to the woman to come forward and assist us with our enquiries.

She has been described as white, aged in her 50s, long dark, greyish hair, 5 feet 7 inches tall and wearing casual clothing.

Detective Sergeant Nicola Smith from the Western Investigation Team said: "We are investigating the circumstances of how this man came to be injured in James Street yesterday morning. It's really important we speak to people who may have seen what happened to him.

"We are particularly keen to speak to a woman who was at the scene at the time the ambulance was called. Was this you? If so, please get in touch."

Anyone with information in relation to this incident is asked to call 101 and quote 44190238411.

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and leave information anonymously.
