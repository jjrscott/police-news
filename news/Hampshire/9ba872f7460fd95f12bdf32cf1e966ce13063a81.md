A statement from Assistant Chief Constable Scott Chilton on the emergency Coronavirus legislation:

"We are in the middle of a national health emergency and we all have a part to play to protect others.

"As a police force, we are no different to anyone else, in that our priority is to reduce the spread of this infection and protect the NHS.

"Our officers have been engaging with people so they understand why they need to be indoors, explaining the risk to public health by not complying, and encouraging them to go home.

"I'm pleased to say that the majority of people understand why this is needed and are following the directions.

"However, where people do not comply, then we will direct people to go home, and, if necessary, we will issue a penalty notice - a fine of Â£60 in the first instance.

"We see this as a last resort, but we will use our powers if we have to.

"Ultimately, we are all in this together so it's important that the public listen to the advice as this is about saving lives."
