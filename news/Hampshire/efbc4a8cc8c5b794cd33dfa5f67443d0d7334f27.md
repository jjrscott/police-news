We are appealing for witnesses and information after a number of vehicles in a car park were damaged in Fareham.

The four vehicles affected were two cars and two mopeds. The damage included windows smashed and tyres slashed and the seats of the mopeds were also slashed. The damage is believed to have occurred on the morning of November 28.

A man in his 40s, who arrived at the car park in West Street just after 7am, encountered a suspect and tried to detain him. The suspect however was able to get away but caused a scratch to the the employee's cheek and chest. Both injuries were minor and the victim did not seek medical assistance.

The suspect is likely to have run in the direction of the Tesco supermarket in Quay Street. He is described as wearing dark clothes and a face covering.
