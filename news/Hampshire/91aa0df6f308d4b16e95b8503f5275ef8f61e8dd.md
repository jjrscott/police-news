A 22 year-old man from London has been charged with four offences relating to being concerned in the supply of heroin and crack cocaine, and possession with intent to supply heroin and crack cocaine.

Devanni Goodwin, aged 22, of Warwickshire Path, Lewisham was arrested last Thursday (18 March) night, after the vehicle he was travelling in failed to stop for police on the A303 in Hampshire.

His arrest was made as part of a proactive drugs investigation called Op Monument, with the Metropolitan Police into a suspected county line being run between London and Andover.

He appeared before Southampton Magistrates Court on Saturday (20 March) and was remanded in custody.

He is next due to appear at Southampton Crown Court on 19 April for a pre-trial public hearing.

A second person, a 30 year old woman from London, was arrested at the scene on suspicion of Dangerous Driving and Possession with Intent to Supply Class A drugs has been released under investigation.
