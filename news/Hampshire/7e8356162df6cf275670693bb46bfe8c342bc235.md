Two men from London have been charged with drug offences relating to a suspected county line operating from London into Hampshire.

Mohamed Mukhtar, aged 22, of Francis Chichester Way, London has been charged with being concerned in the supply of heroin and crack cocaine and possession with intent to supply heroin and crack cocaine.

Mohammed Warsame, aged 21, of Voltaire Court, Battersea, London has been charged with being concerned in the supply of heroin and crack cocaine, possession with intent to supply heroin and crack cocaine and possession of criminal property.

Both men were arrested on Tuesday in London as part of a proactive drugs investigation with the Metropolitan Police into a county line being run from the city into the Hart and Rushmoor areas of Hampshire between November 2020 and March 2021.

Officers located a large amount of cash and mobile phones at the time of arrest.

Mukhtar and Warsame appeared at Basingstoke Magistrates Court yesterday and were both remanded in custody.

They are next due to appear at Winchester Crown Court on the 28th April for a pre-trial public hearing.
