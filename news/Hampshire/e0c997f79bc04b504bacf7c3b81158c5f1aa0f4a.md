The public are advised to avoid the Hogmoor Road and Hogmoor Inclosure areas in Bordon currently as there is a 200 metre cordon in place after a suspected World War Two device was uncovered by construction workers.

The Explosives Ordnance Disposal team are on scene but have warned that the closure may be in place for several hours - very possibly into this evening's rush hour and beyond.

Building sites, a caravan site and the concrete works in the area have been evacuated as a precaution and members of the public are also asked not to come to Hogmoor Inclosure.

It is likely the A325 Templars Way may also be affected by the cordon.
