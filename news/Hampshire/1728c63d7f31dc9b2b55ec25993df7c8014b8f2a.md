We're appealing for witnesses following a fatal collision in Micheldever this morning (July 17).

We were called to the A33 southbound, near to Micheldever Woods, following a collision shortly after 8am.

The vehicles involved were a blue Toyota Yaris, a Ford Transit van and a silver Peugeot Expert.

The driver of the Toyota Yaris, a 63-year-old woman from Basingstoke, was pronounced dead at the scene.

Her next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers.

No one else suffered any injuries.

Investigations into the exact circumstances of the collision are ongoing.

PC Paul Farquharson, from Whitchurch Roads Policing Unit, said: "We are appealing for anyone with information about this collision to come forward and talk to us. Were you travelling along this road or were you in this area this morning? Did you see what happened or did you see any of the vehicles involved?"

"We're also keen to speak to anyone who may have dash cam footage which could help with our enquiries."

Anyone with information is asked to contact us on 101, quoting 44190249497, or Crimestoppers can be called anonymously on 0800 555 111.
