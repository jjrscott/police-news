Have you seen this car? Believed to be in the Bournemouth or Bevois Valley (Southampton) areas.

We are appealing to the public to help us locate this vehicle - suspected to have been used in the commission of criminal offences.

The silver BMW X5 is distinctive as the X5 lettering, normally located on the boot, is missing. The car (which is the exact model pictured in the image) also has silver roof rails.

We believe it is likely to be parked up in a quiet residential street or private car park and may have been there since the end of January.

Has a car you don't recognise been parked up in your road or private parking?

If you have spotted a vehicle you suspect to be the BMW, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44190351817.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
