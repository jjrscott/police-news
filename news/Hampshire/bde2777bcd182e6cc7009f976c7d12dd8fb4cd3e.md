We are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted following a road-rage related incident in Southampton.

The incident occurred at around 10.35am on Saturday 31 October close to Southampton Airport and the slip road to the M27 Eastbound and Southampton A33.

A black Nissan Qashqai became aggressive towards a driver who had stopped at a roundabout and began beeping his horn. The driver of the Nissan then pulled in front of the victims car, came to his window and opened the door in the process and proceeded to punch him in the face causing minor injuries. The suspect then fled the scene in his vehicle.

The suspect is described as an Asian man in his late 20s, approximately 5ft 7" with brown hair and a moustache. He was seen wearing a red football top.

Were you on the road at the time? Did you witness the incident? Perhaps you have dash-cam footage that could help our investigation?

Anyone with information is asked to call 101, quoting the reference 44200422428. Alternatively, you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
