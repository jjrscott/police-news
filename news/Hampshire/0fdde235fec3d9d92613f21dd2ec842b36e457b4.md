We are appealing for witnesses after a collision in Southampton between a pedestrian and grey Mitsubishi Outlander.

The collision took place at around 8pm yesterday (1 October) at the roundabout on Charlotte Place.

The pedestrian, a 50-year-old man from Southampton, was treated by paramedics for an injury to his shoulder and head.

Officers investigating the collision are keen to speak with anyone who might be able to assist their enquiries.

Were you in the area at the time? Or perhaps you have dash cam footage showing the moments leading up to the collision?

Anyone with information should call 101, quoting 44200381430.
