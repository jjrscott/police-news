Do you recognise these two men?

We want to talk to them in connection with a distraction burglary at the One Stop shop in Mill Road, Purbrook.

We were told that between 9.40pm and 9.50pm on 25 August, two men entered the shop. While one distracted staff, the other went behind the till and stole a box containing more than Â£500 worth of cigarettes.

Officers would like to speak to the two men pictured about this incident, and would also like to identify a white estate car that was parked on Bell Crescent during this incident.

If you saw this car, caught it on CCTV or dashcam, then please call us.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44190302455.
