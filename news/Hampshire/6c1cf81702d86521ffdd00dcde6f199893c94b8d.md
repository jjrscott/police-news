We are appealing for motorists who might have been driving past Milbrook Train Station between 3.30pm and 4.30pm today (Sunday, August 11) - and who have dash cam footage - to get in touch with Southampton police.

Officers are investigating an assault on a man in his 40s that resulted in him sustaining stab wounds. The injuries require hospital treatment but are not believed to be life threatening at this time.

Investigating officer DC Steve Norridge said: "We believe we are looking for two suspects. If you were in the vicinity of Milbrook Train Station or Mountbatten Road around this time and you saw something or someone suspicious, please get in touch.

"We would particularly like to talk to anyone who was driving past the station and has dashcam footage over this period of time. Please call 101, quoting reference Operation Wimbourne."
