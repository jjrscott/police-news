We are appealing for information after a robbery in Lee-on-the-Solent on Saturday 28 December.

Shortly after 8pm, a group of around 8-10 youths approached three teenage boys on Sandhill Lane within Alver Valley Country Park.

When they refused to hand over their possessions, the group attacked them and stole their personal belongings.

All three boys suffered facial injuries and had to attend hospital for treatment.

The items taken were: two grey iPhone 6s, a grey Gucci wallet containing cash, a debit card and a Thorpe Park season ticket, and a black Beats Pill speaker.

The suspects are all described as being male, 17 to 19 years old and having their faces covered at the time of the robbery.

One was reported to have been carrying a black baseball bat, or similar weapon, that was used in the assault.

We are appealing for witnesses who live in the area or may have been out walking their dog and seen the group of youths in the Cherque Farm area.

We believe they travelled to the area on foot from Gosport and that one of them may have been riding a bicycle.

Anyone with information should call 101 quoting 44190464891 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
