We're appealing for witnesses after two teenagers were robbed in Southampton yesterday afternoon.

The two 15-year-old boys were approached by three unknown older boys along West Quay Road, at around 3.20pm.

The trio threatened the teenagers before stealing one of their wallets and running off towards Southampton train station.

The teenagers did not suffer any injuries.

The three older boys were aged between 15 and 18. One is described as having ginger hair and was carrying a man bag. Another is described as being black and wearing a white tank top, blue shorts and a silver chain.

DC Daisy Towers said: "Lots of people were out and about shopping when this happened, so we are appealing for anyone who was in the area to think back and try to remember if they saw these three?

"Did you see them running off? Do you know who they are? If so, please speak to us."

Anyone with information is asked to contact us on 101, quoting 44190254013, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
