A dispersal order has been put in place in the St Mary's area of Southampton to reduce anti-social behaviour and associated crime.

The order covers an area that includes St Matthew's Close, St Mary's Street, Golden Grove, Kingsland Estate and Houndwell Park. It was put in place on Thursday, 4 June and will last until 7.30pm Saturday, 6 June.

It gives officers the power to disperse people under Section 35 of the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014, they can also seize any items used in the commission of anti-social behaviour.

Those under 16 will be taken be to their home address, and follow-up work will be done with parents.

Police Sergeant Allan Dineley said "We know that anti-social behaviour has a negative impact on those living and working in the St Mary's area and this behaviour is not acceptable.

"Our officers are on the ground today patrolling the area in order to disperse groups of youths who are seen hanging around the area and we will continue to patrol the area over the coming weeks to engage with the community and keep the public safe.

"Anyone who witnesses anti-social behaviour or large gatherings of people should call 101 or report it to us online at www.hampshire.police.uk. If a crime is in progress, call 999.
