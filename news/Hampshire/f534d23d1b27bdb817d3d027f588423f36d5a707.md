Officers are appealing for information following a public order incident at Hawley Lake.

We were called at 6.36pm on Monday 25 May to a report of a large group of people fighting.

Officers attended, as well as officers from the Ministry of Defence Police.

No injuries were reported and no arrests were made.

Officers were called shortly afterwards to a report of a large group of males making threats in the Pinewood Park area of Farnborough, close to Hawley Woods.

A search of the area was made. No-one was found. The two incidents are being linked.

Inspector Phil Mayne, from the Rushmoor Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "We are working with the Ministry of Defence Police to establish the circumstances of what took place.

"Were you at Hawley Lake at around this time, and did you see what happened? Or perhaps you might have any other information that you think could help the investigation? If so, please get in touch.

"Our officers will be carrying out reassurance patrols in this area. If you have any concerns, please speak to them."

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the reference number 44200186061.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
