We are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted in Portsmouth in the early hours of Sunday (December 22).

The 40-year-old man was walking on Daulston Road between midnight and 00.16 when he is believed to have been attacked from behind and lost consciousness.

He suffered injuries to the back of his head.

Officers investigating the assault are keen to trace two men who assisted the victim and helped him to his feet.

They would also like to trace a man who was on the opposite side of the road and had a conversation with the assaulted man after he was helped.

Did you witness the assault in Daulston Road on Sunday, or maybe you assisted a man who you found lying on the pavement?

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44190458430. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
