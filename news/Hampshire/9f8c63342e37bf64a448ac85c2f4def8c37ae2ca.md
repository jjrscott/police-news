Two boys have been arrested after one attempt robbery and one robbery in Southampton.

We were called just after 5pm yesterday, 27 February, to reports of an armed robbery on Shirley High Street. The victim, an 18-year-old man, was approached by two boys who threatened him with a knife and stole his bike.

We then received a further report that at 4.20pm yesterday on Shirley Road, two boys matching the same description had attempted to take a 39-year-old man's bike by force but were unsuccessful.

Officers, with the assistance of a police helicopter, conducted a large scale search of the area for the suspects.

A 13-year-old boy and a 16-year-old boy, both from Southampton, have been arrested on suspicion of robbery.

They remain in custody at this time.

Anyone with information can phone 101 with reference 44210074585.
