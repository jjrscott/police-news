Do you know these men?

We are appealing for information after a transgender woman was assaulted on Ludlow Road on Tuesday 21 July at 9pm.

A man was reported to have been verbally abusive towards the woman, specifically about her gender identity, before spitting in her face and assaulting her by punching her in the head several times.

The man also spat in the face of a man trying to intervene and help the woman.

The man is believed to have come from a white BMW estate parked nearby, that was being driven by another man.

The man we trying to identify is described as black, with short curly black hair. He was carrying a vodka bottle at the time of the incident.

Do you recognise him?

The man who we believe as his associate seen in the BMW nearby is described as Asian and wearing black vest. Can you name him?

Anyone with information that could assist should call 101 and quote 44200272670.

PC Alexa Ward said: "People should be able to live their lives free of harassment and fear.

"Targeting someone because of their gender identity or sexual orientation, or a misguided perception is completely unacceptable and should not be tolerated.

"If you recognise these men, please get in contact with us.

"We encourage anyone who suffers hate crime, or receives a serious threat against them to report it to the police, either by calling 101 (999 in an emergency) or online through the True Vision website at www.report-it.org.uk."
