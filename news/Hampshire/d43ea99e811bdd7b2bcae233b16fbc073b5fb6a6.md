We are appealing for information as part of a burglary investigation in Locks Heath.

The burglary took place at an address on Locks Road, at some point between around 2pm on Saturday 28 March and around 12.50pm on Saturday 4 April.

Items of jewellery and a quantity of money was stolen.

Officers investigating a keen to speak with anyone who may be able to assist in their enquiries.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you see anything suspicious over the weekend?

Maybe you have been offered or seen some items of jewellery for sale?

We are particularly keen to locate two items of sentimental value to the victim, a diamond ring and a Tiffany bracelet.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting the reference 44200120730. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Advice:

We would like to take this opportunity to remind people of some of the steps they can take to protect their home:

 * Close and lock all your doors and windows, even if you're only going out for a few minutes
 * Double-lock any door
 * Make sure all valuables are out of sight
 * If you have a quantity of valuable jewellery, consider storing it in another safe location such as a safety deposit box
 * Keep handbags away from the letterbox or cat flap and hide all keys, including car keys, as a thief could hook keys or valuables through even a small opening
 * In the evening, shut the curtains and leave the lights on
 * Set your burglar alarm
 * Make sure side and rear gates are secure and locked
 * Register all property for free on immobilise.com
