We are appealing for witnesses after a 30-year-old man was seriously assaulted on Canute Road in the early hours on Sunday 15 September.

The man had been in Mango Thai and when he went outside, a man punched him in the face.

The man suffered a broken jaw.

The incident happened between midnight on the Saturday (Sept 14) and 2am on the Sunday (Sept 15).

The man has been described as black, with short black, curly hair, 5 feet 10 inches tall and wearing a beige top.

Were you in Mango Thai that night or were you passing along Canute Road at this time?
