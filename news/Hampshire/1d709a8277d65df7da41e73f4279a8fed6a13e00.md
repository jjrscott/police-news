We are appealing for witnesses following a report of an aggravated burglary in the Harefield area of Southampton.

It took place sometime between 1.55pm and 2.10pm on Thursday 19 December.

Three men entered a house in Fritham Road, and threatened a man inside.

They were then seen to run from the house and get in to a green or brown vehicle.

No injuries were reported. Nothing was stolen.

All three men are described as being Asian, aged in their 20s, of average height and medium build.

One of the men was described as wearing a blue parka-style coat with a furry hood, blue or black tracksuit bottoms with a white stripe on the side, gloves and grey shoes.

Another was described as wearing a dark grey parka-style jacket with a furry hood, black trousers, and trainers with luminous orange soles.

Detective Constable Paul Hills said: "This took place during the day, and people may have been in Fritham Road.

"If you saw what happened, or have any other information that could help our enquiry, then please call us."

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44190455561.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
