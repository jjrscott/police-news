We are appealing for witnesses and information following an altercation between two motorists on the northbound A34 near Kings Worthy on Wednesday 4 November.

The incident is alleged to have occurred sometime between 4.30pm and 6.30pm. Both vehicles, a silver Mercedes S400 and a silver or grey Vauxhall car-derived van, had pulled over onto the side of the northbound A34, after the Kings Worthy junction, and an altercation took place which resulted in both parties being injured.

One of the men, a 48-year-old, attended hospital with stab injuries, after he was found in his car at the Gladstone Street car park, near Winchester train station. Officers were called there at 6.52pm that day.

The man attended hospital but was discharged the same day following treatment.

Were you travelling on the A34 around this time? Did you see anything suspicious or do you have dash cam footage that may have captured this incident or either vehicle?

If you have any information about this incident, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200428469.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or report anonymously online via https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously.
