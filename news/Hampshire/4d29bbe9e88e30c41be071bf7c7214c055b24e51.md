Do you recognise this man?

We are keen to speak to him in connection with three incidents of criminal damage to an ATM at the Tesco store at Whiteley Shopping Centre.

On October 30, October 31 and November 1, two men were seen by security staff at the centre tampering with the cash machine.

Each time, the pair arrived between 00.30am and 1.40am. Nothing was taken from the machine on any of the nights.

The men were dropped off and picked up each time from the entrance to the shopping centre by a man in a dark coloured car, who remained in the vehicle each time waiting for them to return.

A 29-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted theft. He has been released under investigation.

Officers investigating are now also keen to speak to the man in this picture.

He is described as being between the ages of 20 and 30, white, medium build and with light facial hair,

He was wearing a distinctive large, camo-print puffer jacket, leather jacket and dark beanie hat.

Do you know someone who has a coat like this one? Maybe you saw people acting suspicious on the nights in question.

Anyone with information is encouraged to call 101, quoting 44190394953. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
