Officers conducting a routine stop check on a vehicle in Southampton have arrested two people.

At around 2pm on Saturday 6 February, officers stopped a black Vauxhall on Portswood Road in Southampton after they'd spotted a person of interest in the vehicle.

The driver and passenger were detained while a search of the vehicle was conducted by officers.

A 32-year-old woman from West End, failed a drugs wipe and was subsequently arrested on suspicion of driving a vehicle while unfit through drugs. She was later released under investigation, pending further police enquiries.

While a passenger, a 38-year-old man from Southampton, was arrested in relation to previous firearm offences and was recalled to prison after early release on licence.
