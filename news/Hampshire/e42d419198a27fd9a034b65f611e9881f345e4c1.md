We are appealing for witnesses to an attempt burglary, and theft from motor vehicle, in Andover.

The incident happened at around 1.10am Wednesday, 6 January, at an address on Bishops Way.

Two men forced entry into the victim's vehicle and stole personal items inside before trying to gain entry into the address.

Fortunately, they were unsuccessful.

A small amount of black tape was found at the scene which is believed to have been used to disable the security lights.

We appreciate there isn't much to go on at this time, but the two suspects are described as:
• Wearing a hoody with a logo, and potentially 'nineteen ninety three' down the side of the left arm of the hoody. They were also wearing gloves and facemask.
• Wearing a quilted puffa jacket with a hoody underneath, and carrying a rucksack. They were also wearing a hoody underneath and also wearing face mask and gloves.

Officers investigating are keen to hear from anyone who has information that could assist their enquiries.

Did you see anyone suspicious in the area at the time? Perhaps you recognise the descriptions?

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 with reference 44210005481. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
