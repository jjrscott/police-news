Can you help?

We're trying to identify a teenage girl who threatened a woman with a hammer in a park in Southampton.

The incident happened in Aldermoor Park, Southampton between 9.30pm and 10pm on Thursday, 28 May.

A 36-year-old woman was out walking her dogs in the park with her husband where there was a group of five teenage boys and one teenage girl riding around on a motorbike and a scooter.

Concerned her dogs might get run over, the woman approached the group and spoke to them.

The teenage girl pulled out a hammer from the bike and threatened the woman with it whilst being racially abusive.

The teenage girl is described as being white, around 16-years-old, of slim build, with purple hair worn in a high bun and wearing black jeans, a hoodie and converse trainers.

If you can help us identify the girl described, or if you have any information relating to the incident, please call 101 and quote 44200190889.
