We are appealing for witnesses following a fatal collision in Basingstoke last night (January 2).

Officers were called just before 6.30pm after a collision involving a Honda CRF motorcycle and Vauxhall Vectra on Popley Way.

Despite the best efforts of those attending, the motorcyclist, a 34-year-old man from Basingstoke, was pronounced dead at the scene.

A 24-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.

Officers investigating the collision are keen to speak with anyone who may have witnessed it.

Maybe you have a dash cam and captured footage of either of the vehicles in the moments leading up to the collision?

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200002157. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
