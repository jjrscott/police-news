Four men have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a man's body was found in Corhampton on Saturday 13 July.

The body of Gurinderjit Rai, 41, from Eastleigh, was found in a car in a layby in Shepherds Farm Lane.

A post mortem examination confirmed that the man had died as a result of shotgun wounds.

We believe this was a targeted attack.

The man's next-of-kin have been information and are being supported by specialist officers.

A 25-year-old man, a 28-year-old man and a 29-year-old man, all from Winchester, and a 31-year-old man from Eastleigh, have been arrested on suspicion of murder. They are currently in police custody.
