Donald John Haisman, age 22, of no fixed address has been jailed for 10 years for aggravated burglary following a trial at Southampton Crown Court.

Haisman committed his crime on September 17, 2019 just after 5am.

He forced his way into a property with others on Tatwin Crescent armed with a knife and a Samurai sword and searched the address for items to steal.

The victim was away on holiday at the time of the offence.

Officers deployed to the address and located two men inside, one of which was Haisman.

Officers were able to link Haisman to the crime after they found Haisman's DNA on a Samurai sword that had been stashed in the airing cupboard in the house.

On March 18, The judge handed Haisman a 10 year prison sentence, taking into account that his crime was aggravated by bringing weapons to the address, and that he acted with others in a 'gang.'

Jack Daniel Cove, age 21 of Kinsgsclere Avenue was jailed last year after he pleaded guilty for the part he played in the crime.
