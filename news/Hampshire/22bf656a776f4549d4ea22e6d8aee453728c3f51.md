We are appealing for witnesses and information following an assault on a 16 year old boy at Fleet Pond on October 31 that resulted in the victim requiring surgery for facial injuries.

The incident occurred between 10pm and 10.30pm. The victim was with friends at Fleet Pond. A group of around eight youths wearing dark clothing and balaclavas approached and assaulted the 16 year old.

Do you live in the vicinity of Fleet Pond or Old Cove Road? Did you see or hear anything suspicious around this time?

Do you have private CCTV or a Ring Doorbell that may have captured something? Or maybe you were driving in the area and have dash cam footage that might help our investigation.

If you can help, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200423226.

We believe this incident may be linked to a series of robberies and serious assaults on young people in the Fleet and Farnborough areas over the last few days.

Each report states a group of between five to eight young men approached young victims, assaulted them and demand they hand over valuables.

Local neighbourhood officers have increased patrols in the area. If you're concerned or have information that could help us identify those involved, please get in touch.

Two 17 year old boys from Fleet have been arrested in connection with this incident. They are both on conditional bail while police enquiries continue.
