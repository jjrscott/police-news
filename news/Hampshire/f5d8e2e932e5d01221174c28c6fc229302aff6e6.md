A dispersal order has been put in place in Aldershot Park and surrounding areas over the weekend.

Neighbourhood Inspector Phil Mayne authorised the order on behalf of Hampshire Constabulary. It will run from 8pm tonight, (Friday, July 3), to 8pm on Sunday, July 5.

If it's considered appropriate, a further dispersal order could then be put in place.

The order is in response to ongoing reports of anti social behaviour.

The dispersal order gives officers the power to disperse large groups of people out of the park and surrounding areas as shown on the map.

High visibility patrols continue in the area to reassure the public and to deter large groups from congregating in the area.

Anyone who witnesses anti-social behaviour or large gatherings is encouraged to call 101, or if a crime or incident is in progress, always call 999.
