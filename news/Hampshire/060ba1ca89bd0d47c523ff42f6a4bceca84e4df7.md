We're appealing for information after a man was found seriously injured near a house in Farnborough.

Officers were called at 9.05pm on Tuesday 19 January, after the 22-year-old man was found with serious facial injuries in Caswell Close.

The man had knocked on the door of a house and said to the occupants that he had been assaulted. Police and ambulance were then called.

The man was taken to hospital for treatment. His condition is described as stable.

Detectives are trying to establish the circumstances of this incident and how and where the man came to be injured.

Were you in Caswell Close at around this time? Do you remember seeing anything suspicious? Perhaps you have other information that may help our investigation?

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44210021896.
