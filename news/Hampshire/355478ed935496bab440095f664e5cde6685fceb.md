We are appealing for witnesses to a collision involving a black Vauxhall Vivaro and an 83-year-old man in Basingstoke.

The man was crossing the road at a zebra crossing opposite the entrance to Morrisons supermarket when he was hit by the van and knocked to the ground, causing serious injuries.

Officers are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen the collision or seen a Vivaro van on Worting Road between 11.40am and 12pm on October 30.

The driver of the Vivaro stopped, but did not give any details.

He is described as being a white male, between 65 and 75 years old, of average build and with grey hair.

He was wearing blue jeans and a dark jumper.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting reference 44190389437.
