Officers have arrested a teenage boy after they were assaulted during a routine home visit.

The incident occurred at 3.56pm on Monday 24 August at an address in Marchwood. The officers were visiting the boy to warn him about a number of traffic offences when he became violent, made threats to kill and assaulted two officers in attendance.

As a result, a 16-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of making threats to kill and assaulting an emergency worker.

He was released under investigation pending further enquiries.
