Do you recognise these men?

We would like to speak to them about a burglary at a student accommodation block in Station Street, Portsmouth.

In the early hours of Friday 22 November, a large quantity of items including electrical goods and clothes were stolen, along with cash, from an address in the block.

If you know either of these men, please call 101 quoting 44190421051.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
