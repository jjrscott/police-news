We are extending the opening times for the Gosport Police Station front counter to give residents more opportunity to report crime to us.

The timings will change to ensure the counter is now open three days a week - an increase from the previous two days a week. The new timings are as follows:

 * Tuesday 9am - 4pm (Closed for lunch 12pm to 1pm)
 * Thursday 9am - 4pm (Closed for lunch 12pm to 1pm)
 * Saturday 9am - 3.30pm (Closed for lunch 12pm to 1pm)

These changes will come into effect on Tuesday 3 December 2019.

Outside of these hours, members of the public are encouraged to report non-emergencies to police on 101 or via our online 'Report' tool on the website: https://www.hampshire.police.uk/

Always call 999 in the event of an emergency.

The counter is located at Gosport Town Hall, High Street, PO12 1EB.

Gosport Chief Inspector Mark Lewis said: "There have been changes to the way crime is reported, with a drive to move things online, but we appreciate that some members of our community still prefer to come and speak to someone face to face.

"We are pleased to confirm that changes to the opening times of our front counter here in Gosport mean that we are now open for 17.5 hours across three days. Previously, the counter was open for 14 hours across two days.

"Our communities in Gosport have always been vocal about the issues concerning them, and we have made efforts to ensure we address these by meeting with local community groups, and attending various community engagement events across the borough.

"The new opening times show our pledge to further improve this contact with the public, and I am confident that this will give more people the opportunity to report crime to us so we can continue to tackle the issues affecting our town."

Councillor John Beavis, Chairman of Gosport Community Safety Partnership, said: "I am delighted that the Gosport Police Front Desk will now be open 3 days a week. This is excellent news for the community and illustrates the success of moving the police into the Gosport Town Hall".
