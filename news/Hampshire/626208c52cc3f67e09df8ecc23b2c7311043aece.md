We have re-authorised a section 60 in the areas of Thornhill, Weston and the surrounding areas of Southampton again today (January 25).

The section 60 will be in place from 12pm today until 7am tomorrow (January 26).

This is the third time this week we have used the power which allows us to stop and search anyone in the area without reasonable grounds in order to prevent serious violence involving weapons from occurring.

We have introduced this power again today because we are concerned that there are two groups in the area that may target with one another with weapons.

Section 60 is an emergency power. We do not suggest that it is a long term solution to violent disorder or weapon related crime, however we aware f of concerns in the community and this is our response.

Chief Inspector Phil Lamb said: "Previously this week we stopped and searched 50 people under section 60. We have since increased our patrols in the Thornhill and Weston areas because not only do we want to reassure residents that we are taking action against violent crime, we also want to give you the opportunity to speak with us face to face about your concerns.

"Alongside this section 60, we will also use a section 35 dispersal order if we groups of people found in the area are found to be behaving anti-socially or in a way that could lead to serious violence.
"So far this week, we have had a lot of positive feedback from members of the public, we are only able to use these powers this with the information you pass to us and your ongoing support and for that we would like to say thank you.

"You are our eyes and ears out there so if you see or hear anything suspicious, or if you have any concerns or issues, please do get in touch.

"Report to us by calling 101, or online at www.hampshire.police.uk. You can also find out who your local officers are by visiting www.police.uk.

"You can also report anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. But remember, in an emergency - if a crime is in the process of happening - ALWAYS call 999."
