We're appealing for witnesses following a robbery at a shop in Bitterne last night.

Officers were called at 9.25pm following reports of a man going into the McColl's store on West End Road and demanding cash from the till.

The man, who was carrying what appeared to be a gun, then fled with the contents of the till and some tobacco.

No one was injured during the incident.

Armed officers and a dog unit were deployed and carried out searches of the area.

No arrests have been made at this time but enquiries are ongoing, with several lines of enquiry being followed-up.

DS Naomi Stocker said: "We know that incidents like this will be very concerning to those living and working in the area and I'd like to reassure you that finding those responsible is a priority for us.

"We believe this could be linked to a similar incident at the One Stop store in Butts Road, Sholing, which happened last week.

"So we are working with colleagues investigating that case to ensure all lines of enquiry are progressed thoroughly, including CCTV analysis, house-to-house enquiries and additional patrols in the area.

"We are visiting shops in the area, giving advice to staff and if anyone has any concerns, please call us because your information could really help our investigation.

"If you saw anyone acting suspiciously, hanging outside the shop, or running away from West End Road between 9.15pm and 9.30pm, let us know."

Anyone with information is asked to call us on 101, quoting 44190392756, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
