The family of Lucy-Anne Rushton, who died following an incident at an address in Suffolk Road, Andover, have released a tribute.

Officers were called to the house at 5.30am on Sunday 23 June where Lucy-Anne was found injured.

She was later pronounced dead, and detectives launched a murder investigation.

Lucy-Anne's family said of her:

"A beautiful mother, daughter, sister, niece, auntie and friend. Sadly her life was taken away from us all.

"Part of her will always live on through her children. There will never be a day that she isn't thought about.

"She will be missed enormously by everyone. The life and soul of the party. We are absolutely heartbroken that we will never see her gorgeous face again.

"R.I.P our Angel. We love you Lucy. Never forgotten, always in our hearts. Mum's wild child!"

A man has been charged in connection with this investigation.

Shaun Peter Dyson, 28, of Bury Hill Close, Andover, was charged with murder and appeared at Basingstoke Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 26 June.
