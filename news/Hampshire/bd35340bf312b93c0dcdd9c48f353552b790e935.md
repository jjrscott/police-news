We're appealing for information after a 15-year-old boy was assaulted in Abshot Park, Park Gate.

At around 4.50pm on Sunday 5 July, the victim was with some friends at Abshot Road children's playground when he was approached by another group of youths.

It's reported that the victim was then assaulted by several members of the group and sustained serious facial injuries as a result.

There is a small car park to the side of the park, and we are asking anyone who may have used the car park and captured anything on Dash Cam to contact us.

Equally, if you have any information about this incident and you have not yet spoken to police, please call 101 quoting 44200246776.

Alternatively you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org
