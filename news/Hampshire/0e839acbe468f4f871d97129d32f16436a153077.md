Did you see an abandoned black BMW on Crouch Lane yesterday evening (7 July)?

Officers investigating an earlier assault now suspect the vehicle to have been involved and are hoping to speak with any witnesses who may have seen the vehicle on Crouch Lane that evening.

We are particularly keen to speak with two cyclists who briefly spoke with officers at the scene.

Anyone who was in the area and remembers seeing a black BMW X1 is asked to phone 101 and give the reference 44200250254.

Alternatively you can call Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
