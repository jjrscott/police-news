We are appealing for information about an assault in Portsmouth in the early hours of Sunday morning (21 July).

Around 1.30am, a woman walking along Crasswell Street, Paradise Street and Lake Road was followed by two men on bicycles.

They surrounded her and assaulted her, leaving her in a distressed state and with bruising to her arm.

The main offender is described as aged between 19 to 20-years-old, black skin, about 5ft 8ins tall, short hair in an afro style, skinny build, wearing blue ripped jeans, a black jacket or jumper with white trainers.

Officers would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident or who has information about what happened.
