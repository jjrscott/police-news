Can you help us identify this man?

Officers investigating a robbery in Eastleigh have released this image of a man they would like to speak to.

We were called just after 5pm on Monday, 20 January to a report of a robbery at Megabet on Leigh Road.

A man entered the shop holding a hammer and threatened the cashier before stealing cash from the till.

A member of the public who was in the shop, tackled the man and then chased him on foot before he got away.

The man dropped the hammer as he was being chased.

The man had arrived on a pushbike which he left at the scene.

The man is described as wearing a distinctive grey Lonsdale hooded top with black stripes on the arms.

Do you know the man in the photo - you can't see his face but you may recognise his distinctive top? Did you notice anything suspicious in the area that evening? Do you know anyone who has had some cash unexpectedly?

Anyone who has any information that may help our investigation is asked to call 101 quoting 44200024142.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
