Police officers, who conducted a proactive stop and search on a suspicious vehicle in Swanmore, have arrested two men on suspicion of drug offences.

The incident happened at around 1.08pm on Wednesday 3 February when officers on patrol spotted a vehicle acting suspiciously travelling between the B2177 towards Southwick and the A32.

The vehicle was stopped on Midlington Road just outside Droxford Village. A search of the occupants and the vehicle were conducted by the officers, where a quantity of cash was located within the vehicle - and was seized as a result.

A 24-year-old man and a 31-year-old man, both from London, were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs.

They were both released under investigation, pending further police enquiries.
