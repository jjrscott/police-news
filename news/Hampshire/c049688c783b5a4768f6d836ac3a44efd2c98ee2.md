We are appealing for witnesses and information following an arson at the Turnpike Pavillion recreational ground in Hedge End in the early hours of Saturday 7 November.

The incident, which was initially attended by Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service, was reported to us at 4.20am.

A vehicle had been driven onto and around the cricket pitch at the pavilion, causing significant damage to the practice nets and the surrounding grounds.

It is believed that it was then set alight, with the suspects fleeing the scene.

Officers believe that the vehicle may have been a Toyota LandCruiser, which had bullbars (or a push bumper as it is also commonly known as) on the front of the vehicle.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you see anything suspicious or perhaps you have dashcam footage leading up to the event?

If you have any information relating to this incident, please contact us by calling 101, quoting 44200431869.

Alternatively, you can call independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
