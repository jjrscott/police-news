We're appealing for witnesses following a collision on the M27 at Cadnam yesterday morning (October 23).

Officers were called to a single vehicle collision at junction 1 of the M27 at 11.30am.

A blue Honda Jazz collided with a tree on the eastbound slipway.

The female driver, a 90-year-old from Dorset, was pronounced dead at the scene.

Her next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers.

Investigations into the exact circumstances of the collision are ongoing and we are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen the blue Honda Jazz in the area prior to the incident.

Anyone with information is asked to contact us on 101, quoting 44190379830, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
