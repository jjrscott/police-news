We are appealing for information following a single-vehicle collision in Andover.

Officers were called at 5.22am on Tuesday 21 July to a report that a black Chevrolet Captiva was in collision with a residential property in Locksbridge Road.

It was reported that three people made off on foot from the vehicle.

Two people have been arrested as part our investigation.

A 24-year-old man from Andover was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, failing to stop and a drink driving offence.

A 28-year-old woman from Andover was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, failing to stop, a public order offence and a drink driving offence.

They have been released from custody but remain under investigation.

We are following lines of enquiry to establish the exact circumstances of what took place, and would like to hear from anyone with information who has not yet spoken to us.

Do you remember seeing a 4x4 vehicle being driven in the Picket Twenty area between 2am and 5.20am on Tuesday 21 July?

Perhaps you have CCTV, either residential or commercial, that may assist our investigation?

Or did you see the collision itself and have not yet spoken to us?

If so, please call 101 quoting the reference number 44200271392.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
