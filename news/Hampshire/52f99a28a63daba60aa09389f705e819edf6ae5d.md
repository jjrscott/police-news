We are appealing for witnesses after an attempted robbery in Farnborough.

The incident happened at around 6.30pm on Wednesday, 7 October, in Kingsmead.

The victim, a 36-year-old man from Aldershot was walking from the Meads Shopping Centre into Kingsmead, toward Sainsbury's, when he was approached by three men.

He was assaulted as they asked him to hand over his possessions, the suspects made off empty handed.

An 18-year-old man from Farnborough was arrested on suspicion of attempt robbery and has been released from custody but remains under investigation.

Officers have made a number of enquiries and are now asking you for help.

Were you in the area at the time? Perhaps you saw three men in dark clothing?

Officers are particularly keen to speak to a man in a green Nissan Amira who stopped to help and may have information that could help.

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 with the reference 44200389386.
