Officers investigating an aggravated burglary in Upham are appealing for witnesses.

We were called to an address on Mortimers Lane at 12.46am on Sunday (20 December) to reports of an aggravated burglary.

The victims, a family of three, were at home on Saturday evening when at around 6pm, a number of male suspects forced entry to their home and threatened them with weapons.

The victims remained inside the house as it was burgled.

Personal items and a black Mitsubishi L200 Barbarian pick-up truck were stolen during the incident.

A 78-year-old man and a 21-year-old man received minor injuries during the burglary.

The suspects are all described as wearing masks and dark clothing. One was black and others were white. One of the white suspects was wearing Nike trainers with a red tick and a blue face mask. He is also described as having brown eyes.

Were you in the area on the evening of 19 December, or early morning on the 20 December? Perhaps you saw a black pick-up truck leaving the scene?

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 with reference 44200489173. Alternatively you can phone Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
