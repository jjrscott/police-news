We are appealing for witnesses after three cars were stolen in Portsmouth.

The first incident took place in Aberdare Avenue between 4pm on November 21 and 11.30pm on November 24.

Offenders forced entry to the home before jewellery, around £500 in cash and electronic devices were taken, along with the keys to a Volkswagen Golf parked on the drive. The vehicle was also stolen.

The second incident happened between 11pm on November 24 and 5.30am on November 25 in Gatcombe Drive.

Offenders entered the address, taking the keys to an Audi A3 parked outside and stealing the car.

And the final incident occurred between 8am on November 24 and 11.25pm on November 25 in Drayton Road.

Again, offenders entered the property and took a bunch of keys, including the key to a Ford Focus parked outside. The vehicle was then stolen.

Did you see anything suspicious on these dates and times and in these areas? We are keen to speak to anyone who may be able to assist with our investigation.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44190426228. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Officers have also issued the following advice for residents to follow to help prevent them from being a victim of this crime:

• Remember to secure all windows and doors to your homes
• Do not leave your house and car keys in or near doors and windows
• Keep your car keys out of sight, if possible in a locked cupboard or chest of drawers.
