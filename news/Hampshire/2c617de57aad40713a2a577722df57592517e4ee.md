Officers investigating five robberies in Portsmouth last night have arrested two people.

Between 4pm and 8.30pm yesterday (January 20) we received reports of five separate incidents in Sydenham Terrace, Manners Road, Talbot Road and two in Turner Road.

Officers were deployed to the areas and have been working through the night following up several lines of enquiry.

Fortunately no one reported any injuries. Nothing was stolen during the first two incidents in Manners Road and Talbot Road.

Last night a 16-year-old boy, from Fareham, and a 15-year-old boy, from Portsmouth, were arrested in connection with the incident.

We know news of these robberies will be concerning for residents, but we have been working hard throughout the night and this work continues today, with officers carrying out extra patrols and following up enquiries. So please come up and speak to us if you have any worries.

If you think you might have any information which could help us with our investigations, please call us on 101, quoting 44200024334.
