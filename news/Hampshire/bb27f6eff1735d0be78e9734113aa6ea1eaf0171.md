We are appealing for witnesses and information after a 15 year old boy was threatened with a knife before being robbed on a footpath in Basingstoke.

The incident occurred between 4.45pm and 5.10pm on Saturday, January 2. The victim was walking with a friend along the footpath running between Brighton Hill School and Quilter Road - opposite the zebra crossing in the Asda car park.

They were approached by three teenage suspects who assaulted the victim by hitting him in the face, causing bruising. He was then threatened with a knife and asked for money. He gave them a small quantity of cash and they ran off.

All three suspects are described as being slim white males, aged between 16 and 17, all wearing dark clothing and wearing dark coloured face masks.
