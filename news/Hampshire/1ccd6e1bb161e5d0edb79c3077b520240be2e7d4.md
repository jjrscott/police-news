We are appealing for witnesses after a woman suffered life-threatening injuries in a collision on A339 near Kingsclere.

Police were called at 10.32am on Saturday (February 15) following the collision close to the Star Inn public house, which involved a Vauxhall Astra and Ford Transit Connect van.

A 21-year-old woman, who was a passenger in the Astra, suffered life-threatening injuries and was taken to hospital.

The driver of the van, a 66-year-old man, also suffered serious injuries.

Officers investigating the exact circumstances of the collision are keen to speak with any witnesses, particularly anyone who has dash cam footage of the incident.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200058629.
