A 16-year-old boy from Yateley charged with weapon offences following an incident in Blackwater, was sentenced to a six month Detention and Training Order when he appeared before Basingstoke Magistrates Court yesterday, (August 4).

The incident took place in Oak Farm Close, Blackwater, at around 7.14pm on Thursday 9 July.

The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty to threatening a person with an offensive weapon in a public place, possession of a knife blade/ sharp-pointed article in a public place, and possession of a controlled drug of Class B cannabis.

He was sentenced to a six month Detention and Training Order for each offence of possessing a knife and threatening a person with an offensive weapon, to run concurrently.

There was no separate penalty for the drug offence. The cannabis has been destroyed.

A Detention and Training Order combines detention with training. Half the sentence will be served in custody and the other half under strict supervision of the Youth Offending Team.
