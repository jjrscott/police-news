Do you recognise the two men in the images?

We want to speak to them as we believe they may have information to assist an assault investigation.

At 6.45pm on 17 August a 38-year-old man was assaulted by a man he did not know in the Spitfire pub in Above Bar Street, Southampton.

The victim fell over during the assault and suffered serious back injuries.

There were a large number of people inside the pub at the time, so if you witnessed the assault, or if you can help us identify either the man in the blue top or the man in the light grey top stood with his hand on his shoulder, please call 101 and quote 44190295623.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
