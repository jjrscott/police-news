Do you recognise these men?

Officers are looking to speak with them in connection to the theft of a motorcycle in Southampton on Monday morning.

We received a report that two men had entered a private residential car park on Ordnance Road just before 8am on Monday 8 March and a Honda CRF 250cc motorcycle stolen. The steering lock was broken and the bike wheeled away from the scene.

The bike has then been stored in another car park close by, with the two men returning with a screwdriver in an attempt to start the bike, before being disturbed by a member of the public and fleeing towards College Place.

The two men are described as:

• A white man, aged 18-25, slim build. He was wearing a black and red coat, black trousers and red trainers.

• A white man, aged 18-25, slim build. He was wearing a black coat with a camouflage pattern on the body and sleeves of the jacket, black trousers, black shoes and a black cap.

We appreciate the images aren't very clear, but are hoping someone who knows them might still recognise them.

Were you in the area at the time? Do you recognise the clothing in the images? Perhaps you have dash-cam or CCTV footage?

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101, quoting reference 44210086308.

Alternatively, you can call independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
