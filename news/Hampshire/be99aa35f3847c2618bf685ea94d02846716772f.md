We are appealing for information after 67 pink piglets were stolen from a farm in Damerham, Fordingbridge.

The six-week-old piglets were stolen from the farm between May 20 and May 28, and have the reference HB0789 tattooed on them.

Officers from our Countrywatch team are investigating the theft and are keen to hear from anyone with information.

The piglets were being kept in their family groups, which is important for pigs as they are social animals.

Moving them to a different location could expose them to dangerous bugs and cause unnecessary stress which may lead to premature death.

Have you noticed any new piglets at a smallholding or similar location recently?

The farmer who owns the piglets is understandably extremely concerned for their welfare and we want to hear from anyone who can assist with our enquiries.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200190321. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or email countrywatch@hampshire.pnn.police.uk.
