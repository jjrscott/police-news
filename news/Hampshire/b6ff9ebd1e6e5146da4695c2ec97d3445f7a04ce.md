We are appealing for witnesses, or anyone with dash-cam footage, to come forward following a three-vehicle collision on the M27.

The incident occurred around 2.30pm on Wednesday 16 December on the M27 between Junction 2 (Ower) and Junction 1 (Cadnam).

The exact circumstances of the collision are not yet known, but it is believed that a Mercedes has aquaplaned on standing water on the road and collided with a Volvo which the driver was attempting to overtake. At a similar time another vehicle, a Ford, has also lost control after being struck by a vehicle, leaving the carriageway and colliding with a tree on the embankment.

The drivers of all three vehicles received minor injuries.

Police have conducted initial lines of enquiry into the exact circumstances, but we are now turning to the public for help.

Were you on the road at the time? Did you witness the incident or the moments leading up to it? Perhaps you have dash-cam footage available?

If anyone has any information relating to this incident, please call 101 quoting 44200484465.

Alternatively, you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
