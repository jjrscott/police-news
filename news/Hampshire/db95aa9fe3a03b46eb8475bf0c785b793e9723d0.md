We are appealing for witnesses after a man suffered serious neck and chest injuries in a single vehicle collision in Owslebury last Wednesday (February 19).

Police were called after a black BMW 118D was involved in a collision with a tree at 12.50pm on Longwood Road.

The driver of the vehicle, an 89-year-old man from Cardiff, suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital.

Officers investigating the exact circumstances of the collision are keen to speak with any witnesses.

Did you see the collision happen, or maybe you have a dash cam in your car which captured the incident?

Or maybe you assisted at the scene prior to officers arriving or saw the vehicle in the area of Longwood Road in the moments before the collision?

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200063722.
