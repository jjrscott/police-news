Two burglars will be sentenced next month after stealing approximately Â£7,000 worth of goods from a flat in Gosport.

The flat, on Minnitt Road, was entered between 2.20pm and 2.30pm on 1 November, where cash was stolen along with a number of items including jewellery, designer handbags, an iPad and a mobile phone.

Following an investigation led by the Operation Hawk team, Curtis Coombes, aged 34 years, formerly of South Street in Gosport, and Aaron James Smethurst, aged 35 years, of Bemisters Lane in Gosport, were charged with burglary.

Both pleaded guilty at Portsmouth Crown Court yesterday (14 December) and will be sentenced at the same court on 29 January 2021.

As part of this investigation, a 27-year-old woman from Gosport was given a conditional caution for obstructing police.
