We are offering advice to car owners following recent incidents of catalytic converter thefts in Portsmouth.

There have been at least six incidents reported to us in the Portsmouth area in the last month.

The incidents took place between 19 June and 8 July in the Chewter Close, Ranelagh Road, Butcher Street, Clarence Parade, Hanway Road and Rockrose Way areas.

Five of the vehicles targeted were Toyota Prius, but the most recent vehicle was a Honda Accord.

Thieves steal catalytic converters for the valuable metals they can contain, which are extracted and sold on. Vehicles with a higher chassis are often targeted.

We would like to remind people of the following advice to best protect your vehicle:

 * park your car in a locked garage where possible, but if this isn't an option, then park in a well-lit and well-populated area
 * if parking in a public car park, consider parking alongside other cars and facing your bonnet towards a wall, if possible
 * avoid parking half on the pavement and half on the road
 * look out for people working under cars. If you see anything suspicious, call the police
 * if your catalytic converter is 'bolted on', you can have the bolts welded shut
 * identify/etch your converter with a unique mark or serial number
 * consider using cat clamps - a cage that surrounds your catalytic converter to prevent it being unbolted
 * consider installing security lighting/CCTV on your drive or covering your parking space

Further details on how to keep your vehicle safe can be found on our website: https://www.hampshire.police.uk/cp/crime-prevention/theft-from-a-vehicle/vehicle-safe-and-sound/

If you see something you believe to be suspicious, call 101. You can also report online via our website www.hampshire.police.uk.

If you believe a crime is in progress, always call 999.
