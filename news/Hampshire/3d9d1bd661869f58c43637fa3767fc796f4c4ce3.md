Assistant Chief Constable Maggie Blyth, said: "Following the Government's announcement to changes in the tier system from today (December 26), we want to reassure residents of Hampshire and IOW that we will continue to police the pandemic as we have done.

"All of Hampshire is now in Tier 4, apart from the New Forest which is in Tier 3. The Isle of Wight is also now in Tier 3.

"We have seen this year that the pandemic is an ever changing picture but our policing response is able to adapt to this each time.

"Our approach throughout the pandemic has been to engage, explain and encourage people to comply with the regulations, and this will continue. We will use common sense and discretion to determine what is reasonable and we will enforce when blatant breaches are committed.

"We will continue to work with our partner agencies to keep you and your communities safe, and we will continue with Covid-19 related patrols and be visible as we can be in your neighbourhoods.

"We are still all in this together and if we continue to work together we can limit the spread of infection and ultimately, save lives.

"Be sure to check the restrictions that apply to the area where you live. The Government's website covers the details of all the tiers and also explains exemptions."
