We are appealing for witnesses after two teenagers were robbed in Fleet at the weekend.

The incident happened at around 6.40pm on Sunday, 28 February, on Gally Hill Road.

The victims, a 16-year-old boy and a 15-year-old boy, were approached by two men armed with machetes who made threats and demanded they hand over their belongings. A pair of Airpods and items of clothing were stolen in the robbery.

The two suspects made off in a black Audi.

They are described as:

 * A white man, aged between 16 and 19-years-old, between 5ft 11ins and 6ft tall with an average build. He was wearing a black jacket with black jogging bottoms, gloves, and a face mask.
 * A white man, aged between 16 and 17-years-old, around 6ft tall with an average build. He was wearing a black jacket with blue jeans, a black flat-cap, a mask and gloves.

Officers have conducted a number of enquiries and are now turning to the public for help.

Were you in the area at the time? Perhaps you remember seeing a black Audi in the area?

Detective Constable Jonathan Duggan said: "I'd like to hear from anyone who may have seen these men in the area at the time.

"Anyone with any information is asked to contact us on 101, quoting 44210076012, or call the charity Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously."
