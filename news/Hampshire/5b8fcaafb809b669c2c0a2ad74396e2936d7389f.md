We are appealing for witnesses after man attempted to rob a 74-year-old woman in North End between 10am and 11am on Tuesday 16 June.

The woman was walking along London Road, between Stubbington Avenue and Derby Road, when she was approached by a man who tried to grab her handbag. The lady managed to keep hold of it before the man gave up and ran off in the direction of the high street.

This was understandably a very frightening ordeal for the lady who was targeted.

Officers deployed to the area and carried out a search.

On June 19, we arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of robbery in connection with this incident. He has since been released from custody but remains under investigation.

Our enquiries are ongoing.

We know that there was a number of people in the area at the time this incident happened. Did you see what happened? Can you help is identify the man responsible?

If you can help, please call 101 and quote 44200217252.
