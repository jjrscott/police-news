Updated News Post

Officers investigating an incident in Bradford Road, Southsea, on Friday have made further arrests.

It was reported to us that a 19 year-old man suffered stabbed wounds after he was assaulted by a group of men, between 2.15pm and 3pm.

The man was taken to hospital where he was treated for non-life threatening injuries.

We've already made one arrest and yesterday (January 22) we made two more.

We arrested another 17-year-old boy from Portsmouth on suspicion of robbery, attempt kidnap and grievous bodily harm with intent.

We also arrested a 16-year-old girl from Portsmouth on suspicion of assisting an offender and intimidating a witness.

Both have been released on police bail while our enquiries continue.

Today (January 23) we've made a further two arrests, a 16-year-old boy and a 19-year-old man, both from Portsmouth. They remain in custody at this time.

Enquiries are ongoing and if anyone has any information about what happened, please call us on 101, quoting 44200020638.
