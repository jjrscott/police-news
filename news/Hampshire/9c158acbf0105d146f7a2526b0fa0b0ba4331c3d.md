We are appealing for witnesses after a man died in a collision involving two vehicles on the A337 yesterday afternoon (June 16).

Officers were called just after 2.30pm following a collision involving a Honda Jazz and Land Rover Discovery between Lyndhurst and Bartley.

Sadly, a man in his 70s, who was the driver of one of the vehicles, was pronounced dead at the scene.

We are carrying out investigations into the exact circumstances of the collision.

Officers are keen to speak with anyone who may have witnessed it, or who may have dash cam of the incident or either of the vehicles on the A337 around 2.30pm yesterday afternoon.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200217682.
