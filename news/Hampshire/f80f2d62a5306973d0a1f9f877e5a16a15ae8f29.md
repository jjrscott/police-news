A 21-year-old man and 24-year-old man, both from Southampton, were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder have both been released on bail until January 17.

Officers continue to carry out enquiries following a confrontation between two groups of men, one group in a car, at the junction of Meggeson Avenue and Copse Road in Townhill Park at around 6.30pm.

A shotgun was discharged, causing serious but not life threatening injuries to a 23-year-old man from Eastleigh. He was taken to hospital but later discharged.

The vehicle involved, a dark coloured BMW, left the scene.

Detective Inspector Nick Marsden said: "Our investigation to find out who was involved and what happened on Thursday evening is ongoing and we are working hard on a number of enquiries.

Officers are carrying out house-to-house enquiries as well as extra police patrols in the area. If you have any concerns please come and speak to us.

We are still keen to hear from anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious and anyone who was driving through the area at around 6.30pm and have dash cam footage. You may have footage of the dark coloured BMW that was driving around the area at that time.
