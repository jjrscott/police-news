We are appealing for witnesses after a house on Lionheart Way in Bursledon was burgled on Sunday 22 December.

Two laptops, an Xbox One, a GoPro3 camera and a Pandora bracelet were taken.

Can you help?

We would like to hear from anyone who was in the area between 6.30pm and 7pm last Sunday who saw anyone suspicious.

Please call 101 and quote 44190459548.
