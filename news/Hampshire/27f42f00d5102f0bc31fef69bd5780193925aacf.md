We are appealing for witnesses after a single-vehicle collision in Basingstoke on Sunday evening (February 28).

Police were called just after 5pm to the collision, in which a silver Vauxhall Astra left the road at the junction of Scotney Road and Oakridge Road and came to rest in the garden of one of the houses on Oakridge Road.

Two men, one in his 20s and another in his 30s, suffered serious injuries in the collision.

Enquiries into the exact circumstances of the collision are ongoing, and officers are keen to speak with anyone who can assist.

If you saw the collision and have not spoken with officers yet, or have a dash cam or CCTV camera which may have captured footage of the collision, then we want to hear from you.

Officers also want to speak with anyone who may have seen the silver 2008-plate Astra in the moments leading up to the collision.

Anyone with information should call 101, quoting the reference 44210075771.
