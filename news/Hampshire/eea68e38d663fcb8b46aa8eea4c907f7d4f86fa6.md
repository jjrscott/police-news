We are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted on Burleigh Road, Fratton on Monday 16 November.

We were called at 8.35pm to reports that a group of young people had caused a cut wound to a man's arm.

A second man received minor injuries to his shin and face.

We would like to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and may have seen or heard anything.

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 with reference 44200444475.

Alternatively, you can phone Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
