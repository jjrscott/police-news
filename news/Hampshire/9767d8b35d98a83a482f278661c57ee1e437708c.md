Do you know this person?

We are looking to speak with them in connection to a series of thefts from motor vehicles in Romsey over the weekend.

We were called to an address on St Blaize Road after entry was gained to a vehicle and a handbag stolen at around 1.48am on 22 January.

Overnight between Thursday 21 January and Friday 22 January fourteen such incidents were reported to us in the Romsey Town and Romsey Extra areas.

The incidents are being treated as linked.

Officers have made some enquiries and are now turning to the public for help in identifying the man in this image.

We appreciate the image isn't very clear, but are hopeful someone may recognise his clothing.

He is described as being a white man, between 18 and 25-years-old, and wearing dark clothing with reflective trainers. He was also with another man of the same description.

Do you recognise him? Perhaps you have other information that may assist in our enquiries?

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 with the reference 44210025116. Alternatively, you can phone Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
