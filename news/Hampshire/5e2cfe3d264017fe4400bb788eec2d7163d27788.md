A pedestrian that was seriously injured in a collision in Minley has since died in hospital, we can confirm.

Police were called at 5.07pm on Wednesday 13 January this year to the A327 Minley Road, half way between the A30 and the Crown & Cushion pub where a blue Vauxhall Mokka had collided with a pedestrian.

Bogdan Adrian Albon, aged 39 years, of Bartons Way in Farnborough, was taken to St Georges Hospital in Tooting for treatment, and sadly died from his injuries on Sunday 17 January.

His family are being supported by specially trained officers.

We continue to appeal to anyone who witnessed the incident and the events leading up to it, or captured anything on Dash Cam, to get in touch.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44210014319.
