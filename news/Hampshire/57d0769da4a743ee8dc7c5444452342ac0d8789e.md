We're appealing for witnesses after a man was left with a serious injury to his face following an assault in Southampton.

Officers were called to Westridge Road, Southampton, following reports of five men forcing their way into an address at around 7.30pm on Wednesday, April 8.

The men assaulted the 44-year-old man, leaving him with a serious injury to his face caused by a glass bottle.

The men then fled the scene.

Did you see a group of men running together in the area that evening? Or a group of five men acting suspiciously in the Westridge road/Portswood Road area?

Four of them are described as being black and one was described as being white.

If you think you can help, call us on 101, quoting 44200125844, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
