We are appealing for witnesses following a report of a burglary at the Petersfield Town Football Club on Love Lane.

Entry was forced to the property between 8am on Saturday 4 July and 9.30pm on 7 July causing damage to a large window.

It does not appear that anything was stolen.

We have conducted a number of enquiries and are now turning to the public for help.

Did you see anything? Perhaps you've seen someone acting suspicious in the area of the Football Club?

We are particularly keen to identify two young people who were seen in the area. They are described as follows:

 * A white boy, aged between 14 and 16-years-old, slim build, with short mousy brown hair. He was wearing a grey Nike hooded top with black sleeves and a white t-shirt with the word POLO across the front, denim jeans, black and white trainers. He was also carrying a dark rucksack.
 * A white boy, aged between 14 and 16-years-old, with short brown hair. He was wearing a dark blue hooded top with Nike Air written across the front, dark coloured shorts, with white socks and dark coloured trainers. He is also described as wearing a gold chain around his neck

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44200250403.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
