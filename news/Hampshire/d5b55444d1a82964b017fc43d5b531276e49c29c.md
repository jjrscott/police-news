We are appealing for witnesses and information after a firework was put through the letter box of a house in Tennyson Road, Southampton.

The incident occurred at around 9pm on Thursday, October 15. The firework went off, causing scorch marks to the floor, walls and ceiling. Luckily no-one was injured although the residents were at home at the time.

If you can help, please call 101, quoting reference 44200401366. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
