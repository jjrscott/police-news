A Basingstoke man who was seriously assaulted during an incident in Gershwin Road in October last year, has sadly died in hospital.

We are now treating the incident as a murder investigation and are continuing to appeal to the public to get in touch with any information they may have.

The incident occurred on the night of Halloween, October 31. The victim, Frazer Brabant, was found in the rear garden of a residential property in Gershwin Road with serious head injuries.

Frazer has remained in hospital ever since but passed away on Tuesday, January 21.

Detective Inspector Lee McClellan said: "This was an extremely violent and cowardly attack that happened nearly three months ago.

"Nearly three months that Frazer has spent in hospital, unable to speak or communicate in any way with his family, who were at his bedside throughout and who have been left heartbroken.

"We are appealing to anyone who has any information about this crime, no matter how small or unimportant you think it is, please get in touch with us."

"My team and I are committed to finding those responsible and bringing them to justice"
