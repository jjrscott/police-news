We are appealing for information after a robbery at the Co-op Store on London Road in Andover on Monday 2 September.

A man entered the store between 9.40pm and 9.50pm and made demands to staff to open the till whilst holding a knife.

The man took £120 cash from the till and a bottle of Jim Beam.

The staff members were left understandably shaken.

The man had his face covered, carried a kitchen knife and spoke with a local accent.

He has been described as:

• White
• 5 feet 7 inches
• Black hooded top

Did you see anyone in the area around this time behaving suspiciously?

Please call 101 and quote 44190312913.
