Officers returned a quad bike to its owner on the same night it was stolen from a farm premises in Ellisfield.

Police were alerted after an alarm sounded at the premises in College Lane after midnight on July 5. The quad bike and an orange and white Stihl chainsaw were stolen from inside a garage and driven away.

Police attended within minutes and tracked the stolen quad to the A339 in Herriard, where it had been abandoned by the suspects. The quad was not legally able to be ridden on the road so an officer manoeuvred it back across fields to return it to its owner.

The chainsaw has not been recovered to date. If you are offered tools in suspicious circumstances, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200245926.
