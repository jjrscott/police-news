Three people have been arrested in connection with drugs offences after officers stopped a car and a moped in Northam Road, Southampton, yesterday afternoon (21 September).

A 27-year-old man and a 22-year-old man both from Southampton were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class B drugs and an 18-year-old man, also from Southampton, was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class B drugs.

A quantity of suspected Class B drugs and cash were seized.

The 27-year-old man was also later arrested for driving whilst disqualified and no insurance.

All three men have been released from custody but remain under investigation as our enquiries continue.
