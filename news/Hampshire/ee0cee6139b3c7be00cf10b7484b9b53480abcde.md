Do you recognise this man?

Officers have released this image of a man they would like to speak to in connection with a robbery at a Southampton store.

The incident happened at Iceland on Portswood Road, between 1.40pm and 1.45pm on Sunday, 25 October.

The victim, a 20-year-old woman, was at work in the store when a man approached the till and purchased a bottle of water. When the woman opened the till, the man leant over and grabbed her, before taking cash from the till and running off down Brookvale Road.

The woman did not receive any injuries during the incident.

The man is described as white, aged between 25 and 30-years-old, around 6ft 1ins with a slim build.

He was wearing a grey hoodie, dark jeans, a blue surgical mask and a dark beanie hat possibly with a New York logo which read 'NY'. He had a fresh cut to his nose and a plain dark tattoo to the right side of his neck.
