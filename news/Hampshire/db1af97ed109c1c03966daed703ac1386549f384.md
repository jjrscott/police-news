Do you recognise this man?

Officers investigating a burglary at a Costa coffee shop on London Road, Cowplain, in the early hours of Saturday morning wish to speak to him in connection with the incident.

Entry was forced to the store between 1.40am and 1.45am, before food and drink was taken from the chillers inside.

The man entered twice, both times bringing food back out to the pavement with him, before leaving the scene.

He is described as being between 25 and 35 years old, white and of average build.

We realise the image is not the clearest, but we hope someone may recognise this man.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200058433. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
