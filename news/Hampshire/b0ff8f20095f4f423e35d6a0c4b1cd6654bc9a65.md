We are appealing for information after a 26-year-old woman from Southampton was assaulted whilst walking in the wooded area off Aldermoor Road on Friday 12 July.

The woman was near the basketball court between 9.30pm and 9.50pm when a teenage girl approached her and assaulted her.

The teenage girl is described as:

 * White
 * Aged 16 to 17-years-old
 * 5 feet 5 inches
 * Skinny build
 * Long, dirty blonde hair

The girl was with a group of friends of similar age. Another girl in the group is described as having long brown hair, medium/large build and was wearing something pink. There were also boys in the group who were all wearing black or grey tracksuits.

The woman suffered bruising to her eye and needed medical treatment.

Officers are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed this incident, who saw a group of people as described in the area around the time, or who may recognise the descriptions.
