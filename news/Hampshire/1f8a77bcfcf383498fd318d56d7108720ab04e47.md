A 21 year-old woman will appear in court to face a charge of concealment of the birth of a child between 27 December 2019 and 25 January 2020 following the discovery of a new-born baby girl's body in Portsmouth in January 2020.

Our enquiries throughout 2020 did not identify any evidence of a criminal act in relation to the death of the baby girl.

Following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service 21 year-old Lisa Blagden from the Milton area of Portsmouth has been served a postal requisition to appear at xx court on 7th April 2021.
