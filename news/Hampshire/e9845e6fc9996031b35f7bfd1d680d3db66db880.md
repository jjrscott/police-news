Our officers in Southsea who are tackling commercial burglaries in the area have made an arrest.

A 30-year-old man, from Fareham, has been arrested on suspicion of burglary, theft of a motor vehicle and theft from a shop.

The arrest comes after a burglary at Goldchem Pharmacy in Albert Road, on January 1.

A handbag and car keys to a Vauxhall Corsa were stolen from the staff area. The Vauxhall Corsa was stolen but later recovered.

The man has been released from custody but remains under investigation as our enquiries continue.
