We are appealing for information following a report of a sexual assault in the Popley area of Basingstoke.

It was reported that an 18-year-old woman was sat on a bench near the junction between John Hunt Drive and Popley Way, sometime between 10pm and 11pm on Friday 7 February, when a man approached her.

The man indecently exposed himself to her and then grabbed at her clothing. He then ran away on a footpath beside Popley Way.

The woman was not injured and the incident was later reported to police on Tuesday 11 February.

The man has been described as:

• white
• aged in his early 20s
• of slim build
• having thin lips, a thin chin and light coloured facial hair
• wearing a black hooded top with the hood up, and dark bottoms

We are keen to hear from anyone with information on this incident.

Were you in the area of the junction of Popley Way and John Hunt Drive around this time?

Do you remember seeing something suspicious? Perhaps you remember seeing someone who matches the description given?

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44200052747.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
