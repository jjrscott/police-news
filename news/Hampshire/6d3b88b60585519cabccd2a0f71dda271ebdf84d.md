We're releasing an E-fit of a person we'd like to identify following the attempted robbery of a 17-year-old boy in Gosport.

Earlier this month, we issued an appeal after it was reported that the victim was threatened by two men on the pathway in Leesland Park that leads to the skate park, at around 10.40pm on Wednesday 29 July.

One of the men had a knife.

The victim managed to cycle off and was uninjured. Nothing was stolen.

The suspects are described as being aged between 18-20, both white males and both had beards.

The first male was around 5ft 6ins tall and described as being of medium to stocky build with a full face beard. He was wearing a grey tracksuit.

The second was described as being around 6ft tall, of slim build, and was wearing a darker grey tracksuit.

The knife is described as a four inch black lock knife with an orange metal handle with black splashes on it.

We would like to hear from anyone who can help us identify the person pictured as part of our enquiries, or has any other information to assist us.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101, quoting reference 44200285014.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org
