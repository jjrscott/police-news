We are appealing for witnesses after a man in his 20s was assaulted in a car park in Hayling Island on Tuesday night (May 19).

The man was involved in an argument with a second man, aged 28, in the car park at Hayling Beach, opposite Chichester Avenue, between 9pm and 9.30pm.

He suffered injuries to his head in the attack, requiring hospital treatment.

The 28-year-old man, from Hayling Island, was arrested on suspicion of GBH. He has been released on bail.

Officers investigating the exact circumstances of the assault are keen to speak with anyone who witnessed the assault.

It is believed a number of cars were parked in the car park at the time, and we also want to speak with anyone who may have dash cam footage from between 9pm and 9.30pm.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200178204. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
