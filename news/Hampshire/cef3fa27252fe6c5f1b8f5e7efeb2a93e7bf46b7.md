Officers have released an efit image of a man they would like to speak to following a report of a knifepoint robbery.

The incident took place at a house in Newcombe Road, in The Polygon area, sometime between 2.10am and 2.30am on Monday 13 April.

A 27-year-old woman reported answering a knock on her door by a man who asked for a glass of water.

When she went back inside, the man followed her and threatened her with a knife.

He then stole a mobile phone before leaving.

The man was described as:

• White
• Of skinny build
• Around 20 years old
• Around 5ft 2ins tall
• Medium length blond hair
• Wearing a long black jacket that looked too big for him
