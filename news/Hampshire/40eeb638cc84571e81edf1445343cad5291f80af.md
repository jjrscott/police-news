We are appealing for witnesses to an aggravated burglary which took place at Golden Touch Amusements in Southampton yesterday morning (Tuesday 18 June).

At around 6.50am, the arcade, which is located on Above Bar Street, was entered by a man who approached a lone member of staff.

The staff member was tied up before the offender stole Â£11,000 from the safe. He was not injured during the incident.

We are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed anything, or anyone acting suspiciously in the area around this time.

Officers would also like to identify the man pictured who can be seen wearing a distinctive camo pattern coat with a hood. He was also wearing sunglasses.

Do you know this man?

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44190209006, or call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
