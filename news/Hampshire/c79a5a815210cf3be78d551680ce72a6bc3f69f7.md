We're appealing for witnesses following a serious assault in Southampton.

The incident occurred shortly before 11.30am this morning, Tuesday 15 December in Cowdray Close, Southampton.

An 18-year-old man was approached by two men who assaulted him.

The victim suffered stab wounds to his chest, arm and leg during the assault.

He was taken to Southampton General Hospital where he is being treated for serious, yet not threatening injuries.

Enquiries into the exact circumstances of the incident are ongoing and officers are keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed anything.

We're you in the area at the time? Did you see anything? Perhaps you were driving in the area and have dashcam footage?

Anyone who has any information, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200482884.

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
