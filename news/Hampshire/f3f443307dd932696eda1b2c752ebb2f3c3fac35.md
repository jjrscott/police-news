Updated News Post

Three more teenagers have been arrested following two break-ins at a Portsmouth school.

We received a report on Tuesday morning (February 25) following a break-in overnight at Arundel Court Primary School, in Northam Street.

Officers attended the school and met with staff who confirmed that there had also been a break-in overnight on February 17.

Damage was caused inside the premises and some items were stolen.

Following our enquiries we arrested a 14-year-old boy, from Portsmouth, on suspicion of two burglaries. He has been released on police bail until March 25, while our investigations continue.

We can also let you know that we have arrested three more teenagers, another 14-year-old boy, a 13-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy, all on suspicion of two counts of burglary.

Our investigations are ongoing so if anyone has any information that could help us, please call 101, quoting 44200071241.
