We are appealing for information after five lambs were found dead in a paddock near Andover.

The incident took place sometime between 6.30pm on Wednesday 3 July and 8.51am the following day, at an address in Ox Drove, Picket Piece.

The owners kept lambs in the paddock and discovered that five had died on the morning of Thursday 4 July.

The dead lambs had neck injuries consistent with a dog attack.

There are no footpaths that run across the property and it is likely that a dog ran and forced its way into the paddock.

PC Steve Rogerson, from Hampshire Constabulary's Country Watch team, said: "This would have been devastating and shocking for the owners to discover.

"The dog responsible would have been covered in blood as a result and the owner would have been aware that something had happened.

"We would like to hear from anyone who has information that could help our investigation.

"I'd also like to remind people that dogs worrying livestock is a criminal offence contrary to the Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act 1953.

"Our advice to dog owners is to keep your dog on a lead when in or near a field with livestock.

"Ultimately, if you are not confident that your dog will return promptly on command, it should not be off the lead."

Anyone with information on this incident should call us on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44190231338.
