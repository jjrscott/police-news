We are appealing for witnesses after a silver Ford Fiesta failed to stop following a collision in Portsmouth on Saturday evening (May 16).

Police were called just before 6pm after the collision involving a red MG and the Fiesta in Goldsmith Avenue, Southsea.

Despite initially looking as if it was going to stop, the Fiesta then drove away down Winter Road.

Officers investigating the collision are keen to locate the man who was driving the Ford, and are urging him to contact us.

They also want to speak with anyone who witnessed the collision and could help identify the driver, or who may have noticed a Fiesta parked near their home that has sustained damage since Saturday night.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting the reference 44200173685. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
