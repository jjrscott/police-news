We are appealing for witnesses following an attempted robbery in Leigh Park.

The incident took place in an alleyway between Greywell Road and Basing Road.

Between 4pm and 4.30pm on Wednesday 6 January, a 40-year-old woman was approached by an unknown man, who threatened her with a knife and demanded that she hand over her possessions.

The woman managed to run away, having received minor injuries. Nothing was taken.

We would like to speak to a man in connection with the incident. He is described as follows:

 * Aged between 30 and 40 years-old
 * Large build
 * Wearing a dark hoody and trousers and a black/blue scarf

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44210006092.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org
