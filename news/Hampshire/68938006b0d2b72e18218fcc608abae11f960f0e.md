We are appealing for information following a report of a robbery at a Tesco Express store in Andover.

It took place at around 9.20pm on Thursday 2 January, at the store in Compton Square.

A man entered the store and demanded the shop worker give him money from the till.

When he was told there was no money, he attempted to hit the till before running away when more staff arrived.

No money was taken and no injuries were reported.

The man was described as:

• white
• around 6ft tall
• aged 30 to 40 years
• of big build
• wearing black trainers with white soles, blue jeans, a dark coloured jacket with a maroon coloured hooded top underneath with the hood up, dark coloured bandana across face, dark coloured gloves

We have released a CCTV image of a man we would like to speak to as part of our enquiries.

Were you in this area at the time? Did you see anything suspicious? Perhaps you remember seeing a man nearby in similar clothes? Did you see where he went after leaving the shop?

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44200002207.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
