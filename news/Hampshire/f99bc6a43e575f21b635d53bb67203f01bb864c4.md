Were you in Winchester City Centre in the early hours of Saturday, October 12?

Do you have any dash cam or mobile phone footage taken in the city centre between the hours of midnight and 6am? If so, we would urge you to get in touch.

We are investigating a serious sexual assault on a woman in her 20s that took place at around 5am in the vicinity of St George's Street.

Detective Inspector Graeme Eaton said: "We are appealing to people who were either driving or on foot in the city centre who may have seen or heard something suspicious or captured images or footage that might help our investigation.

"We are interested in any footage taken in the city centre, but are also very keen to see any captured in the vicinity of St George's Street, St Peter's Street and Jewry Street.

"If you were out and about within these timescales and think you can help, please contact us by calling 101, quoting Operation Diagram.

DI Eaton added: "I would like to reassure residents that this type of incident is very rare. We are doing all we can to establish what has happened and prevent any further offending. High visibility patrols continue to be carried out in the area."
