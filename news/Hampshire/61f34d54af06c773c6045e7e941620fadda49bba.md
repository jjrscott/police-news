We're appealing for witnesses after a 15-year-old boy was robbed in Southsea.

It was reported that the victim had been walking through the Japanese gardens, near the Canoe Lake, when he was assaulted by two youths.

This took place between 7pm and 7.30pm on Sunday 26 July.

During the incident, the victim had his wallet and an Apple Airpod case stolen.

The youths were described as black, and one was described as wearing a Nike camouflage style padded jacket.

We have information to suggest that mobile phone footage of the incident may have been captured.

If you saw this incident take place, or captured any footage of it, please contact us.

As part of this investigation, officers have arrested a 14-year-old boy from Southsea on suspicion of robbery. He remains in custody at this time.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting 44200280151.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
