We're appealing for information following a robbery at a play park in Basingstoke.

Between 8.40pm and 9.20pm last night (Friday 23 October), the 16-year-old victim was sat with two friends on a bench in the park between Oakridge Road and Shakespeare Road.

He was approached by two teenagers, thought to be aged around 17 or 18, who asked to borrow his bike.

When he refused, they threatened him with a knife and stole the bike before heading off in the direction of Oakridge Road.

One of the suspects is described as male, white, 6ft tall, skinny, wearing a beanie hat and dark clothing.

The other was described as male, white, more than 6ft tall, chunky, wearing grey clothing.

Did you witness this incident, or see these two suspects in the area before the incident, or after the incident with the black Carrera Vengeance pushbike?

The bike was later recovered in the Popley area.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44200412982.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
