A man has been charged as part of a proactive investigation into a County Line being run from South London to Winchester.

On Thursday 11 February, detectives investigating a county line running from London to Winchester executed an early morning warrant in Streatham, as part of a wider operation looking into drugs supply.

The warrants were executed by officers from the Met's Specialist Crime department, Operation Orochi, supported by Op Monument officers from Hampshire Constabulary.

As result, Theo Beckford, aged 21, from Stockwell Road, Lambeth, London has been charged with being concerned in the supply of crack cocaine and heroin.

He appeared at Basingstoke Magistrates Court today (Friday 12 February) and has been remanded into custody.

He is next due to appear at Winchester Crown Court on March 17.
