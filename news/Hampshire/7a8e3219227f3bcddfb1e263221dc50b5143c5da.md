We are appealing for witnesses and information after a six year old boy sustained injuries after being bitten by a dog in a Basingstoke park.

The incident occurred at around 4.45pm on Tuesday, August 13, in the park off Brighton Way.

The boy received injuries to his face, neck and hand. He was treated in hospital but the wounds are not believed to be life threatening.

The dog has been seized by police and remains in secure kennels and the owner, a 29 year old female, was arrested. She has since been de-arrested but will be questioned by police in due course.

Were you in the park around this time? Did you see or hear anything - if you can help, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44190286902.
