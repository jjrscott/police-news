We are appealing for witnesses and information after an attempted robbery on a 17 year old boy in Gosport by two bearded suspects.

The incident occurred at 10.40pm on Wednesday, July 29, on a pathway in Leesland Park, that leads to the skate park. Two suspects have blocked his path and one has produced a knife and made threats.

The victim managed to cycle off and was not injured.

The suspects are described as being aged between 18 - 20, both white males and both had beards.

The first male is around five foot six inches and is described as being of medium to stocky build with a full face beard. He was wearing a grey tracksuit.

The second suspect is around six foot tall, of slim build, and was wearing a darker grey tracksuit.

The knife is described as a four inch black lock knife with an orange metal handle with black splashes on it.

Do you recognise the descriptions? Were you in the vicinity of the park at this time and do you have CCTV or dash cam footage that may have captured the suspects? If you can help, or if you have any other information, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200285014.
