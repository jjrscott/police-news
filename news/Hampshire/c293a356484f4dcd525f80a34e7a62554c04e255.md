We have arrested two 14-year-old boys following an incident that happened on Shirley Road yesterday evening (Weds 25 November).

The arrests come after a 24-year-old woman reported that two boys threatened her and her 23-year-old partner with a weapon, described as a machete, just before 6pm last night.

We deployed to the area and arrested two 14-year-old boys from Southampton.

One 14-year-old was arrested for possession of a class B drug and affray.

The other was arrested for affray.

They both remain in police custody at this time.
