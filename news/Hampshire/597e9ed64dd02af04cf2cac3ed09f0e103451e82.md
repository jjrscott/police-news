Police officers investigating a burglary in Ringwood have arrested two people in connection with the incident.

Officers were called out at 2am this morning (3 February) to reports of a burglary in progress at The Original Vape Shop on Monouth Court, Ringwood.

Four persons have entered the premises through a smashed window and a number of items, including vape machines, were stolen in the process.

Officers pursued a vehicle in the area believed to be linked to the burglary, when the occupants decamped and fled from officers. Two of the offenders were located by officers and detained.

A 16-year-old girl and a 17-year-old boy, both from Southampton, have been arrested on suspicion of burglary.

They were also both subsequently arrested on suspicion of taking a motor vehicle without the owner's consent following a burglary in Sway on Monday night (1 February).

They both remain in custody at this time, as police enquiries continue.
