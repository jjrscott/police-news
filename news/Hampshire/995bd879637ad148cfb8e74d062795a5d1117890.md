Can you help us identify these two men?

We want to speak to them in connection with a series of thefts from motor vehicles across Havant and Waterlooville.

One of the men, who is crouched down in the image, is wearing all dark clothing, but this appears slightly lighter in the picture.

There have been as many as 20 incidents in the Cowplain, Waterloo, St Faiths, West Leigh and Purbrook areas between 27 December 2019 and 10 January this year.

Small items and cash have been stolen. The majority of the vehicles targeted were left unlocked.

We are encouraging anyone who has been affected to report it to us, so we can build up a bigger picture of the areas being targeted and when.

If you recognise the two men in the CCTV images, or have any information to assist us, please call us on 101 quoting 44200006837.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.

We would like to take this opportunity to remind vehicle owners to ensure their vehicles are locked, and valuables are not left inside.
