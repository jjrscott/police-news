We are appealing for residents to be on their guard after three burglaries in the Fleet and Church Crookham area.

Neighbourhood Sergeant Noel Griffiths said: "With the nights drawing in recently, it's a good time to consider your home security and think about using simple tactics to make your home appear occupied if you are out all day or away.

"This includes using timer switches for lighting and leaving your radio on to make your property appear occupied. If you have a back gate, make sure it is locked so there is no easy access to the back of your property.

"Other security measures include installing CCTV and an alarm and security lighting with motion sensors. For more information about crime prevention, visit www.hampshire.police.uk.

"Please contact us if you see suspicious vehicles or people around. You can ring 101 or if you believe a crime might be occurring, always call 999."

On November 6, two neighbouring properties in Northfield Road, Church Crookham, were broken into.

At the first property, the offenders have gained entry via the rear of the building. A search was carried out and jewellery items stolen. The suspects then gained entry to the neighbouring property via the rear of the building. They carried out a search of the property and stealing jewellery and cash before leaving the address.

Between 6.30pm and 8.30pm on the same day, suspects have forced entry into a property in Basingbourne Road, Fleet. They have searched the property and stolen jewellery, cash and personal items.

If you have any information about these crimes, or if you have been offered property you suspect is stolen, please call 101 quoting reference 44190399173.
