We are reminding residents to keep their homes securely locked over the summer following reports of burglaries in Farnborough and Aldershot.

Overnight between Tuesday, July 23 and Wednesday, July 24, suspects got into an insecure porch at a property in Cargate Hill, Aldershot. They stole a set of car keys and took the owner's dark blue Ford Mondeo, which had been parked on the driveway.

On Tuesday, July 23, between 2pm and 4pm, suspects have gained entry to a property in Cargate Hill, Aldershot, via a front door that had been left open to allow air to circulate. A handbag containing bank cards was stolen.

Fortunately, the handbag and cards were recovered by a Police Community Support Officer who searched a nearby park.

However, the owner's car, a blue Suzuki Alto, was later stolen from an adjoining driveway on the same night.

Between 9am and 11.10pm on Monday, July 22, suspects have stolen an iPhone XS Max mobile phone from the hallway of a property in Sandy Lane, Farnborough. The front door had been left open in the hot weather.

We know it is tempting to leave doors and windows unlocked and open in the summer when it's hot, but it's important to remember that this can give burglars the perfect opportunity to enter your home.

If you're upstairs or out of the room, even just for a few minutes, close them and help shut burglars out.

Of course, burglars still target homes when the doors and windows are locked. For more information on how to keep your home secure, visit our website: https://www.hampshire.police.uk/cp/crime-prevention/residential-burglary/
