A shoplifter banned from entering stores in Andover has been jailed for 32 weeks.

Jake Hughes, 29, of The Hexagon, Andover, admitted five counts of theft from a shop and five breaches of a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) at Basingstoke Magistrates' Court on Saturday 29 February.

Hughes was arrested in Manor Road on Friday 28 February following a foot chase by officers from Andover's Neighbourhood Policing Team.

The court heard that Hughes had stolen items such as bottles of alcohol and packets of meat from various stores on five occasions between 13 and 23 February.

In doing so, he breached a CBO imposed by magistrates in June last year.

The two-year order bans him from entering Boots, Waitrose, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Poundland, Co-op, Wilkinson's and TK Maxx in the town.

It also prohibits him from abusing, threatening or intimidating anybody in any retail outlet in Andover.

On Saturday, Hughes was jailed for a total of 32 weeks after pleading guilty to the ten offences.

Speaking after the hearing, Sergeant Pete Robinson, of Andover's Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: "It is disappointing that Hughes has breached the order by committing these offences.

"Hopefully this sentence of imprisonment gives some reassurance to victims that we take these offences seriously and will look at every option to bring offenders to justice."
