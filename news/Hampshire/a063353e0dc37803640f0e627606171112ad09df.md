Officers tackling anti-social behaviour in Portsmouth have issued a dispersal order for the next 48 hours.

This action comes in response to concerns raised by residents living in the Seymour Close area of the city.

We've been made aware of numerous incidents in the area over the last month, involving groups of young people congregating outside and being abusive to residents.

Our teams have been conducting extra patrols in the area but are now making use of a Section 35 dispersal order.

The order covers an area that includes Seymour Close, Buckland Park, Agincourt Road and Arnaud Close, and comes into force at midday today (June 11), lasting until midday on Saturday (June 13)

The Dispersal Order gives our officers the power to order a person to leave the area for a 48 hour period with no return. Refusal to comply with the order is a criminal offence.

Those under 16 will be taken be to their home address, and follow-up work will be done with parents.

Sergeant Colin Kirby said: "We know from having spoken to residents in the area how much anti-social behaviour can have a negative impact on people's lives and this is simply not acceptable.

"While we have ensured that we have extended our patrols in the area, we also feel that making use of these powers to disperse groups of people will help us further to tackle this issue.

"While we are all still doing what we can to keep each other healthy during the ongoing pandemic, we want to reassure our communities that our core work around making our neighbourhoods safer for everyone is still our priority."

Anyone who witnesses anti-social behaviour or large gatherings of people should call 101 or report it to us online at www.hampshire.police.uk. If a crime is in progress, call 999.
