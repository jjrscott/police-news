Officers investigating the death of 23-year-old Sagar Bhatti from Avon Green in Chandler's Ford, have charged a man with manslaughter.

Sagar died following an incident on Woodside Avenue on March 10, 2019. Officers arrested two men in connection with this death.

Both men were interviewed and released from police custody pending further enquiries.

In April 2020, after officers presented a file to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), the CPS advised the investigation team that no further action should be taken against the men.

In that time, Sagar's family asked the CPS to review the decision through the Victim Right to Review Scheme.

The outcome of the review has meant that the CPS has now authorised the police to charge one of the men with manslaughter.

Kieran Peter Hobbs, aged 30, of Yonge Close, Eastleigh, will appear before Southampton Magistrates Court on October 13.
