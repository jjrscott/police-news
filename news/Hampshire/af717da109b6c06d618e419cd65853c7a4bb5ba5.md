A man has been found guilty of brutally stabbing a police officer twice in the back.

Michael Enzanga, 20, of no fixed abode, was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent following a two week trial.

The jury took just 45 minutes to find him guilty of plunging a knife into the back of PC Russell Turner, in Stamshaw Park on February 21.

He was also found guilty of possession of a bladed article, four counts of possession of Class A drugs with intent and possession of criminal property.

He is due to be sentenced on October 4.
