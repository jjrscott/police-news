Were you on Leigh Road in Havant yesterday evening (Wednesday 2 Oct)?

We are appealing for witnesses after a 17-year-old girl was assaulted by a man between 6.30pm and 7pm.

The girl did not sustain any injuries.

Officers deployed to the area and arrested 30-year-old man on suspicion of assault.

He remains in police custody at this time.

Today (Oct 3) we are specifically appealing to a woman who we believe stopped and helped the girl.

Was this you?

Please call 101 and quote 44190352305.
