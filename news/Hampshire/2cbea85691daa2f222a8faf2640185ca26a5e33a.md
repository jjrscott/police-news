We're appealing for witnesses after an incident that took place in Basingstoke, between 6.15pm and 6.40pm yesterday, Monday 25 May.

We were called at around 6.30pm to reports of an assault in the Winklebury Way area of Basingstoke.

On arrival, officers found a 41-year-old man and a 36-year-old man with stab wounds. Both men were taken to North Hampshire Hospital to be treated for their injuries.

Neither are thought to be in a life-threatening condition.

A 16-year-old boy from Camberley, Surrey, has been arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent. He remains in custody at this time.

Were you in the area at the time? Perhaps you saw something suspicious in the time leading up to the assault?

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101, and quote the reference number 44200186100.

Alternatively, you can phone Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
