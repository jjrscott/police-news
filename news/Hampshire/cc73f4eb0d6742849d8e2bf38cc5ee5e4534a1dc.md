We previously issued a witness appeal following an assault in Southampton that left a man with a fractured skull.

Officers are continuing to trace the man in the CCTV image who they would like to speak to in connection with the incident.

The assault happened in Vodka Revolutions just before 2am, Saturday 9 November.

The man in the image is described as being white, between 25 and 40 years old, 5 feet 8 inches tall, well-built with short, light coloured hair. He also has a tribal tattoo on his upper left arm.

If you recognise him or have any information that could help us identify him please call 101 quoting 44190403888.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
