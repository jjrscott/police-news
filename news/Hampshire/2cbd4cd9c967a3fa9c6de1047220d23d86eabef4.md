Do you recognise this man?

We would like to speak to him in connection with a burglary in Southampton.

At around 2.30am on Monday, 24 February, a house in Alderney Close was broken into and a set of car keys were stolen from inside.

A red Volkswagen beetle was stolen from the driveway, but this has since been recovered by police.

We would like to identify the man in this picture so we can speak to him as part of this investigation.

If you know him or have any information about this incident, please get in touch by calling us on 101, quoting 44200069845.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

We would like to take this opportunity to offer some burglary prevention advice:

 * Your home is only as secure as its weakest point of entry. That's why it's so important to have doors and windows that are as secure as possible
 * Simply shutting the door won't prevent burglaries. Double-lock the door every single time you leave the house
 * If you have high value items such as jewellery, watches, passports, credit cards, computer data and identification documents, you may want to consider storing them in a safe
 * Burglars tend to target windows as they generally offer easier access than doors. Keep them locked, and take a good look at your windows from the outside, removing potential access points where you can. Are there walls, bins or garden furniture that could be used to reach windows?
