We are appealing for information following an altercation outside Portchester Crematorium last Friday.

Police were called after a man was assaulted between 2pm and 3pm on 7 November, in the car park of the crematorium on Upper Cornaway Lane, Portchester.

The man suffered injuries to his face and hand.

This followed a collision between a white Audi Q7 the man was travelling in and a silver Audi A5 on Southampton Road, Portsmouth.

A 64-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of GBH and failing to stop and is currently in police custody.

We are appealing for anyone who either witnessed the collision between the two Audis or who saw a man being assaulted in the crematorium car park.

Maybe you have a dashcam and were travelling on Southampton Road between 2pm and 3pm.

Anyone with information should call 101, quoting reference 44190401370. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
