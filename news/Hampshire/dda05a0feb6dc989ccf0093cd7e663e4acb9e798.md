Officers from Winchester's Neighbourhood Policing Team have carried out three warrants in Bishop's Waltham today (Thursday 25 July).

The activity was carried out following concerns raised about drug-related activity and associated anti-social behaviour.

Searches were made of two houses off Winchester Road, and a further one in Greens Close.

Small amounts of a suspected Class A substance and a Class B substance were found.

No arrests were made. Enquiries are ongoing.

Sergeant Stuart Gilmour said: "We are committed to tackling drug supply and associated activity.

"Operations like the one today can only come about thanks to information from the public.

"If you have concerns about drug-related activity where you live, don't assume that someone else will report it. Even the smallest bit of information can help us build a better picture of what is going on.

"Anyone with information can call us on 101. Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously."
