We are appealing for witnesses to a collision on the Northbound A34 involving a Vauxhall Corsa and two HGVs, in which an 83 year old man was seriously injured.

The incident occurred at 11.52am on March 16 between the Whitchurch junctions. The Corsa was in collision with both vehicles, one of which was a car transporter and another large goods vehicle that was parked up in the layby.

We would like to speak to anyone who witnessed what happened or who saw the vehicles prior to the collision. If you have dashcam footage that might help our enquiries, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting 44200099043.
