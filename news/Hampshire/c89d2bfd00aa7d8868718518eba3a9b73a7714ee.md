We are appealing for information following a house burglary in Farnborough.

It took place at a house in Queen Victoria Court sometime between 6pm on Friday 6 September and 5pm on Monday 9 September.

The house was entered and untidy search was made. Enquiries are underway to establish what, if anything, was stolen.

At this early stage of the investigation, we are appealing for anyone who has information about what happened to come forward.

Were you in the nearby Queen Elizabeth Park during this period? Do you remember seeing anything suspicious?

Any information you have could help our investigation.

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44190321780.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
