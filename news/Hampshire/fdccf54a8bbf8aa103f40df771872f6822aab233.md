Officers are appealing for information after a van was set alight in Gosport.

We attended Stoke Road, Gosport, following a call from Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service.

A member of the public had reported seeing a white LDV van on fire in Stoke Road, at around 1.25am on Thursday 1 August.

Firefighters extinguished the fire, which caused damage to the interior of the vehicle.

This incident is being treated as arson. It's not being linked to any other incident.

We would like to hear from anyone who saw what happened, or who has any other information that could help our investigation.

Anyone with information should call us on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44190270071.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
