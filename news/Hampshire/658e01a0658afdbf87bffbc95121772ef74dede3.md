Officers are appealing for information after a man was robbed and assaulted in Portsmouth.

The incident happened at some time between 8.15pm and 8.45pm on Sunday, 25 August. The 18-year-old victim was on his bicycle in Clarendon Place when he was approached by three males wearing balaclavas.

He was pulled off his bike and assaulted by the group before they stole his bike, along with his fishing rod which was attached to the bike.

The stolen bike is described as a black GT AGGRESSOR XC2, with red forks and shiny black pedals that say 'Boarderman'. There are two green lights on the bard and a red light on the hub on the back wheel. It has a red and black bike seat.

The fishing rod is half black and half bright orange.

The three offenders were all wearing balaclavas, long sleeved tops and black jogging bottoms. Two are described as around 6ft and of medium build, with the third described as taller, between 6ft 2ins and 6ft 3ins, and of stocky build.

Detective Constable Emily Dummer, said: "Sunday was a very hot day and these people would have looked out of place in their clothing. Did you see them in the area, before, after or during the incident?

"I would also like to speak to anyone who may have been offered the stolen bike for sale or may know someone who has recently acquired a bike matching the description.

"Anyone with information should call us on 101 quoting 44190302413."

Anyone with information should call Hampshire Constabulary on 101 quoting 44190302413.
