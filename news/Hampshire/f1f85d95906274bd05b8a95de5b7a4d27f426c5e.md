We are appealing for witnesses after a fire was started in a building on Victor Street, Shirley, on Monday evening (February 10).

Police were called by Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service, who responded to the fire at Factory of Fun children's play centre.

The play centre has not been open for business for some time.

The fire has caused considerable damage to the main play area building, including the roof and external supporting walls.

We are investigating the exact cause of the fire and officers are keen to speak with anyone who may have seen anything suspicious outside the building between 4pm and 6pm on Monday.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200052374. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
