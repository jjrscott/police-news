We are appealing for witnesses and information after a break in at the Co-op in Yateley.

The incident occurred between 11.15pm and 11.45pm on Sunday, October 6. A dark coloured vehicle containing four male suspects, was travelling along Reading Road before stopping outside the shop in Plough Road.

The suspects have broken into the shop. It is believed they were planning to steal cigarettes but triggered an alarm which caused them to flee.

Were you in the vicinity? Did you see a dark vehicle with four men inside? If you have any information, CCTV or dash cam footage, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44190357594. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
