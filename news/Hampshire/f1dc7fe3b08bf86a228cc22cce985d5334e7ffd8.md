We are appealing for witnesses after a collision at the St Margaret's roundabout of the A27, Southampton Road, in Titchfield.

Police were called just after 6.30pm to the collision, involving a Vauxhall Zafira and Renault Captur.

One of the vehicles had overturned, and a woman has had to be extricated from the vehicle.

Officers are currently at the scene and we would ask that people avoid the area if they are out on the road this evening.

Anyone who witnessed the collision or who has dash cam footage of the incident should call 101, quoting reference number 1642 of today's date (November 22).
