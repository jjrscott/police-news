Can you help us identify this man?

Officers investigating an assault in Cosham have released this image of a man they would like to speak to.

We were called just after midnight on January 11 to reports of an assault in Highbury Way.

A 46-year-old man reported being assaulted inside The Portsbridge pub before being targeted again a short time later outside the pub between 12.10am and 12.30am.

The victim was knocked unconscious, left with facial injuries and a broken rib.

Were you in The Portsbridge pub that evening? Did you see what happened?

We particularly keen to speak to the man in the yellow jacket in the image, as we think he will have information about the incident which could help with our investigation.

We know the image is blurry, but we hope someone will be able to recognise the man.

Anyone with information is asked to call us on 101, quoting 44200012583, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
