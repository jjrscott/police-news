Do you recognise the man in this e-fit?

We would like to hear from anyone who recognises this man following a report of a robbery on Gore Road in New Milton on Friday 7 February.

A woman in her 50's was approached near New Milton Leisure Centre between 8.20pm and 8.25pm by a man who was carrying a knife and demanded she hand over her property. The man stole £130 cash, a mobile phone and the woman's bank cards.

The woman was not injured.

The man has been described as:

• White
• Aged 20 to 30-years-old
• 5 feet 10/11 inches tall
• Thin build
• Very short hair
• Heavy facial stubble
• Bushy eyebrows

Distinctively, the man is described as having a tear drop or heart tattoo near to his left eye.

At the time of the offence, it is said he was wearing dark trousers or jeans, a dark Puffa jacket, brown boots and a tartan scarf. The woman also believed he smelt of cigarettes.

Do you know who this is?

If you do, please call 101 and quote 44200048538.
