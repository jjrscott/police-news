We are appealing for witnesses to an altercation between a man and woman that took place on Friday, September 20.

The incident occurred in Southampton Road, Portsmouth at around 2.50pm. The 26 year old woman had been walking with two young children in a push chair when she was approached by the man. An altercation followed.
