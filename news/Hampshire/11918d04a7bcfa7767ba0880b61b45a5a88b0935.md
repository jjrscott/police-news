Officers investigating an assault in St Mary's Churchyard in Fratton have made an arrest, and continue to appeal for information.

As previously reported, it's alleged a woman in her 50s was subjected to an unprovoked assault by a man she did not know in the churchyard at around 3am on Tuesday 14 July.

She sustained some facial injuries as a result, but these did not require hospital treatment.

The man was described as white, very slim, aged in his late 20s or early 30s, with dark curly hair at ear length, a pale complexion, wide dark eyes and a round child-like face.

He was described as wearing a light-coloured top, round 'Harry Potter' style glasses and he had a rucksack on his back.
