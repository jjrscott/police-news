Hampshire Constabulary and Thames Valley Police joined forces last week in a two day operation to tackle criminality in rural areas.

Officers from Hampshire's Country Watch, TVP's Rural Crime Unit, Roads Policing and Dog Unit were out on patrol in northern Hampshire and the southern fringes of Thames Valley. This ongoing operation is in direct response to recent criminality in these areas.

During the course of the operation, officers seized one vehicle as the driver had no insurance, and they arrested a 24 year old man from Hounslow on suspicion of driving whilst impaired through drink or drugs. He has been released under investigation to await the results of toxicology tests.

Officers were also involved in a pursuit after a vehicle suspected to be involved in criminality failed to stop near Hartley Wintney. The National Police Air Support helicopter was also involved in the search for the vehicle.

That vehicle has since been recovered in Sandhurst for forensic examination. Any witnesses or drivers with dash cam who may have seen suspicious activity involving a Toyota Rav 4 in Lower Church Road, Sandhurst at around 10pm on November 13, please get in touch by calling 101.

Hart District Neighbourhood Sergeant Martyn Evans said: "These regular nights of action are run between Hampshire and Thames Valley Police - using an intelligence led approach. We will use whatever tactics are required to disrupt and detect their criminality.

"I would like to assure residents and landowners that we take rural crime extremely seriously. We are conducting patrols in rural areas but we would urge anyone to ensure as far as possible to secure and alarm their buildings and property mark their equipment. Consider installing CCTV, tracker devices, automatic security lights and intruder alarm systems.

"Rural crime is a priority for us and we will continue to relentlessly pursue suspects. The community are our eyes and ears and we encourage you to report all incidents as soon as you are able to by calling 101 if it's not an emergency. If it's happening there and then, always call 999."
