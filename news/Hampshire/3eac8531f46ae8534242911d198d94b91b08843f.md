We are appealing for witnesses and information after two incidents of alleged robbery in Farnborough involving a group of youths.

The first incident occurred at around 9pm on Tuesday, July 9, in Farnborough Skate Park. A group of around nine youths have approached two males, both aged 21.

Were you in the skate park that night? Did you see what happened? A number of the youths are then believed to have got into a grey Audi A3. Did you see a grey Audi driving erratically near Farnborough town centre around this time?

Around an hour later on the same night, between 10pm and 10.25pm, an 18 year old man was in Victoria Road, Farnborough, near the Kentucky Fried Chicken.

A group of youths approached him and asked him for money but did not take anything before the 18 year old ran off.

Did you see anything suspicious? If you have any information regarding either of these incidents, please call 101, quoting reference 44190238934.

An 18 year old man from Farnborough has been arrested in connection and released under investigation.

Two other 18 year olds from Farnborough, were arrested but released with no further action.
