A man has been arrested following our investigation into a number of indecent exposure incidents in Fordingbridge.

The man, 49-years-old and from the New Forest, was arrested yesterday (February 2).

He was arrested in connection with six indecent exposure incidents that occurred on Frog Lane on June 6, Sept 13, Jan 22, Jan 25, and two incidents on Jan 28.

He has been questioned by officers and released from custody, but remains under investigation to allow for further enquiries.

Anyone who has witnessed these incidents or believe they have also seen a man behaving in this way in the Frog Lane area who has not made contact with us, is asked to call 101.
