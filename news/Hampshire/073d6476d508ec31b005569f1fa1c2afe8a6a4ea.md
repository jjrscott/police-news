A 44 year old man who was arrested on suspicion of the attempted murder of a Hampshire police officer, will appear before Winchester Crown Court on January 13, for a plea and directions hearing.

Thomas Gracey, of Littlemore, Oxfordshire, appeared before Basingstoke Magistrates Court this afternoon. He is accused of attempting to murder an officer, who is in his 20s, following an incident in Churchill Way, Basingstoke at around 4.30pm on April 12.

Officers had attended the address to respond to a concern for welfare. During an altercation, the officer, who is in his 20s, was stabbed with two knives, causing injuries to his head, neck and hands.

The officer is now fully recovered and back at work.

 Gracey remains on conditional bail.
