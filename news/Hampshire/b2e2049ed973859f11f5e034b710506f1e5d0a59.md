We are appealing for witnesses, or anyone with information, following an attempted robbery in Eastleigh.

The incident occurred between 8pm and 8.17pm on Saturday 6 February in an alleyway between Cranbury Road and Desborough Road.

A woman was approached by an unknown man from behind and attempted to grab her handbag. A struggled ensued but the offender fled the scene without any possessions.

The man is described as mixed-race, aged 16 - 20 years-old, between 5ft 3ins and 5ft 7ins, with black afro hair. He was dressed in all black clothing and wearing a black snood.

We've made initial enquiries but are now asking the public for help.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you see what happened?

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call 101, quoting 44210046314.

Alternatively, you can independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
