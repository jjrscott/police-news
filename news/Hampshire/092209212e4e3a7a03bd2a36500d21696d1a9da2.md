Tribute has been paid to a motorcyclist who died in a collision on the A27 Southampton Road at Titchfield.

The collision took place near the Argos store shortly before 6pm on Friday 24 May.

Tim Ford, 40, of Chamberlain Grove, Fareham, was riding his Honda motorcycle on the eastbound carriageway when it went into the opposite carriageway and was in collision with a car.

He was pronounced dead at the scene.

The family of Mr Ford have provided the following tribute:

"Our world changed forever when my brother Tim Ford, aged 40, tragically died in a road traffic collision. Tim was famed in the family for his Frank Spencer impressions and impromptu karaoke singing.

"We really appreciate your messages and thoughts but please can we ask that you respect our privacy at this time.

"Tim, you were taken from us in a blink of an eye. We all will miss you oh so much. You made us laugh you made us cry but up with Dad you shall now fly. Xxxxxxxx"

As part of the investigation, a 47-year-old man from Gosport was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, failing to stop, and failing to report an accident.

He was released from custody but remains under investigation.

Anyone with information about this collision should call police on 101, quoting Operation Shetland.
