We're appealing for witnesses following a report of a burglary at a business lock-up in Howard Road, Southampton.

Entry was forced to the lock-up between 7pm on Sunday, 19 July and 7.20am Monday, 20 July, causing damage to a van that was parked in front of the entrance and a padlock.

A number of off road bikes, quad bikes, a small boat and tools were stolen.

We have conducted a number of enquiries and are now turning to the public for help.

Did you witness anything? Perhaps you saw someone acting suspicious in the area around this time?

Have you been offered for sale any bikes or tools recently?

Do you recognise or have you been offered for sale any of the items pictured?

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44200269889.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
