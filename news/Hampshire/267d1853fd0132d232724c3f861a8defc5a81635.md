Three people have been arrested on suspicion of drugs supply offences after officers carried out a warrant.

This morning (Monday 24 February), officers from Romsey's Neighbourhood Policing Team executed the warrant at a flat in Banning Street.

Drugs and cash were seized.

A 30-year-old man, a 24-year-old man and a 54-year-old woman, all from Romsey, were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a Class A and a Class B drug.

They are currently in police custody. Enquiries are ongoing.

Sergeant Pete Smith said: "I'd like to reassure residents that we are doing all we can to tackle drugs supply in Romsey and keep our communities safe.

"You can help by telling us what is happening where you live. Any information received will help us to build a better intelligence picture and target our resources."

Anyone with information should call police on 101. Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
