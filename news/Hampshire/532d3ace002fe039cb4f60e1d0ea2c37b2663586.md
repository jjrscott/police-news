We are appealing for witnesses to help identify a man who reportedly robbed a group of four teenage boys in Locks Heath on Friday 21 February.

Between 3pm and 3.15pm, the man approached the group in the Crescent Road park where he threatened them and demanded their belongings. One of the boys was then struck in the head, but was uninjured.

The man was described as:

 * White
 * Aged 17 or 18-years-old
 * Slim
 * 5ft 10ins tall
 * Light coloured hair

It was also reported he was wearing a black jacket with a zip-up front, similar to a rain proof jacket with a hood.

Detective Constable Terry Langworthy from the Eastern Investigation Team said: "We have been carrying out patrols and enquiries in the local area and scoping CCTV.

"We would also like to ask anyone who was in the area at the time of the offence if they saw anyone matching this description.

"This incident happened in broad daylight and I'm sure other people would have been in the area at the time this man was.

"If you can help us identify this person, please make contact with us."

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 and quote 44200066839.

Alternatively you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at Crimestoppers-uk.org
