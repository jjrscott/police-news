We are appealing for witnesses following an assault in Southampton on Monday 7 December.

An incident occurred between 8.50pm and 9pm when two men became involved in a physical altercation in Cuckmere Lane playground. A 34-year-old man was assaulted but suffered no injuries.

A 40-year-old man from Southampton was arrested on suspicion of assault, possession of a bladed article and casing criminal damage. He was later released on police bail - pending further enquiries.

Officers are particularly keen to speak with a passer-by who intervened.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you see what happened?

Anyone with information relating to this incident is asked to call 101, quoting 44200472853.

Alternatively, you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
