Two teenage girls have been arrested after a group of Chinese people were targeted by youths in Southampton.

A 14 year old girl and a 15 year old girl, both from Southampton, were arrested on suspicion of affray. They currently remain in custody.

The incident occurred on March 17 just after 8pm in Vincent's Walk, Southampton.

 It was reported a group of people had assaulted and been abusive towards a group of four Chinese people wearing medical face masks.

It was reported the incident was racially aggravated and linked to the Coronavirus.

The victims, three men and one woman are all aged in their early 20s. They did not suffer any lasting physical injuries.

Anyone who has information to help our investigation into this incident should call 101 quoting 44200101024.

Any crime perpetuated through ignorance, prejudice or hate is unacceptable.

 We are working with our partners and the local Chinese communities and we would encourage everyone to report incidents to us either by calling 101, or 999 in an emergency.

 Reports can also be made online on the Hampshire Constabulary website, through True Vision or using the growing network of Third Party Reporting Centres for hate crime.
