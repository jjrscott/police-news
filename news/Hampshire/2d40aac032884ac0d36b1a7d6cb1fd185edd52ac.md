We are appealing for witnesses after a woman suffered serious injuries in a collision involving a cyclist and car in Winchester.

The incident happened just after 7.15am yesterday (August 13) on Littleton Road.

The cyclist, a woman in her 30s, suffered injuries to her ribs, while the car, believed to be a black Vauxhall Corsa, failed to stop at the scene.

Officers investigating the exact circumstances are keen to speak with anyone who may have witnessed the collision, or who saw a black Corsa in the area of Littleton road - heading south east towards Crawley - around that time.

We are also appealing for the driver of the Corsa to make contact with us.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting the reference 44200307662.
