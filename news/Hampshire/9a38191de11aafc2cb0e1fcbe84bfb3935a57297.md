We have arrested three people after we executed a warrant at an address in Golden Grove last night (Tuesday 24 November).

A 21-year-old woman from Southampton, a 32-year-old woman from Southampton and a 48-year-old woman from Southampton have all been arrested on suspicion of possession of section 5 firearm and being concerned in the supply of class A drugs.

This was following the recovery of a suspected Taser and a quantity of suspected class A drugs inside the address.

Southampton Neighbourhoods High Harm Team executed the warrant supported by neighbourhood policing colleagues.

All three women remain in police custody at this time.
