A 25-year-old man from Salisbury has been convicted of numerous drug offences following a warrant at an address in Fordingbridge in 2019.

Benedict Blues, of Elm Grove, Salisbury pleaded guilty to one count of being concerned in supplying a Class A drug, one count of being concerned in supplying a Class B drug, one count of being concerned in supplying a Class C drug and one count of possession of a Class B drug.

Southampton Crown Court heard on Friday 12 March how officers executed a pre-planned warrant at an address in Fordingbridge on 23 February 2019, which they believed the occupants to be concerned in the supply of drugs.

Officers searched the property and located a quantity of LSD, Ketamine, Tramadol and cannabis - all of which was seized as a result.

Benedict Blues pleaded guilty to these offences and was sentenced to 24 months imprisonment - suspended for 18 months. He was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work.
