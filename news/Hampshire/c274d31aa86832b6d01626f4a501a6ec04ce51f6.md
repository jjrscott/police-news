Do you recognise the two men pictured?

Officers are keen to speak to them about a robbery in Southsea.

The incident took place between 6.45pm and 7pm on Tuesday 5 May, at the Spar shop in St James's Road.

It was reported to police that a man entered the store and tried to steal a number of groceries. When challenged by a member of staff, the groceries spilled on to the floor and the man threatened the staff member with two syringes.

The man left the store with two steaks, and it was reported that a second man grabbed some groceries from the floor and left the area without paying.

We would like to identify the two men pictured as part of our enquiries.

One of the men pictured is described as white, slim, around 5ft 10ins tall, aged between 45 and 50, fair hair with a side parting, a short beard and wearing a blue jacket.

The second man pictured is described as white, slim, around 5ft 10ins tall, aged in his 20s, with fair hair and a top knot, a long beard and wearing a tracksuit.

If you know these men, or saw them in the area at this time, please get in touch.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101, quoting 44200159270.
