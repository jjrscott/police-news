We are appealing for witnesses after a 15-year-old girl was sexually assaulted in Farnborough at the weekend.

The incident happened in an alleyway off of Woburn Avenue and Manor Road, between 4.30pm and 5.30pm on Sunday 7 March.

The victim was walking through the alleyway when she was approached by an unknown man who then sexually assaulted her.

He was disturbed by a member of the public entering the alleyway, and made off.

The suspect is described as being a white man, between 30 and 40-years-old, approximately 5ft 8ins tall with a skinny, muscular, build. He has wiry dirty blonde hair, which is worn longer and brushed forward on top with shaved sides, and a short blonde beard.

He was also described as having a tattoo on his left wrist. He was wearing a black hoody, black jeans, and dirty white trainers.

Officers have been in the area conducting a number of enquiries, and are now turning to the public for any information that could assist our investigation.

Were you in the area at the time? Perhaps you know someone matching this description?

We are particularly keen to speak with the woman who walked through that alleyway during the relevant time, especially if you saw a man walking away from a teenage girl.

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 with the reference 44210087771. Alternatively, you can phone Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
