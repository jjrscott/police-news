We're appealing for witnesses following an attempted cash-in-transit robbery.

The incident took place around 2.45pm on Monday 17 February at the Tesco petrol station on West End Road.

Two men on a motorbike attempted to grab a cash box off of a G4S security guard as he made his way from the petrol station back to his van.

A member of the public intervened and the two men left empty handed.

The two men made off on the motorbike, down West End Road in the direction of Bitterne.

Were you in the area around this time on Monday 17 February?
