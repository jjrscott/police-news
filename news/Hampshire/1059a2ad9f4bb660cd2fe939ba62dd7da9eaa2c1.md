We're appealing for anyone with information about a suspicious vehicle suspected to have been involved in a burglary in Fleet.

The burglary took place at around 3pm at an address in Branksomewood Road on Friday 14 February. Two watches were stolen from inside the address.

A black vehicle, thought to be a Jaguar, was seen leaving the area in the direction of Elvetham Road.

Did you see this vehicle, or perhaps capture it and its registration number on dash cam?

Did you see anyone acting suspiciously in the area around this time?

If you have any information, please call 101 quoting 44200057629.

Alternatively you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org
