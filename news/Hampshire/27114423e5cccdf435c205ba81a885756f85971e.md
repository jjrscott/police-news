We are appealing for witnesses and information after an altercation in Queens Road,Farnborough, resulted in a man in his 20s requiring hospital treatment.

The incident occurred between 8.34pm and 8.50pm on Tuesday, August 27, near the Co-op store on Queens Road.

A man was seen carrying a machete-type knife and wearing a mask before being involved in an altercation with four other men. An altercation occurs before the four men get into a black vehicle and drive off.

The victim is taken to hospital where he was found to have sustained swelling and bruising to his head. His injury is not believed to be life threatening at this time.

Detective Sergeant Tim Judd said: "We would like to reassure the public that this type of incident is extremely rare and we are treating this as a targeted assault.

"We are carrying out house to house enquiries in the area and officers will be conducting extra patrols.

"It happened at a busy time of the evening when lots of people were around. We would ask if you were in the vicinity and saw anything suspicious - or if you have dash cam, mobile phone or CCTV footage - then please get in touch by calling 101, quoting reference 44190305031.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111, quoting the same reference."
