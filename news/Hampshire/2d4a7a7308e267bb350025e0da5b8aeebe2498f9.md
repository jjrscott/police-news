We are appealing for witnesses after a boy's bike was stolen from him in Fareham yesterday morning (March 6).

The boy was stopped some time between 7.30 and 8.30am in Vicarage Lane by a group of four teenagers on bicycles.

They stopped the boy and took his bicycle from him, before riding away with it.

The bicycle is a blue and white Boardman, with white front forks and lights on the front and back.

Enquiries are ongoing to locate the group.

The group of teenagers were each male, around 15 to 19 years old and white.

One was described as being around 5ft 11ins tall, of slim build and with short blonde hair. He was wearing a grey top.

The second had black or dark brown hair, and the third is described as having ginger hair.

There is no further details for the fourth member of the group.

Officers are keen to speak with anyone who witnessed the incident, or who may have seen a group of four teenage boys cycling around the Vicarage Lane area.

If you have any information, please call 101, quoting the reference 44210083983.
