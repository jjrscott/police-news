We're appealing for witnesses after a man in his 40s was assaulted in Vincents Walk and Hanover Buildings in Southampton yesterday, 23 September.

The victim was walking past a bus stop on Vincent Walk between 5pm and 5.30pm when another man spat at him. The man then chased the victim to outside Bella Italia, in Hanover Buildings, where he continued to assault the victim.

The victim suffered injuries to his head and was taken to Southampton General Hospital for treatment.

A 44-year-old man, from Southampton, has been arrested on suspicion of GBH. He remains in custody at this time.

Officers investigating the exact circumstances of the assault are keen to speak with anyone who witnessed the assault or anyone who may have been driving in the area at the time who may have dash cam footage.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200369924. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
