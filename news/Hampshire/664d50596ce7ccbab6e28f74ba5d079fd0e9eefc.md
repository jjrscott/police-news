Have you seen this bus?

We are asking for information on its whereabouts, and appealing for witnesses, after it was stolen in a burglary in Romsey earlier this week.

We were called at 8am on 9 March to reports of a burglary at Romsey Sea Cadets on Southampton Road, Romsey.

Entry was forced to the grounds, and a Ford Transit minibus was stolen. It is believed the burglary happened between 5pm on 8 March, and 7am on 9 March.

Investigating officers have conducted a number of enquiries and are now appealing to the public for information.

Do you remember seeing someone suspicious in the area at the time? Perhaps you've seen a Romsey Sea Cadets bus since it happened?

Anyone with any information is asked to phone 101 with reference 44210087758. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
