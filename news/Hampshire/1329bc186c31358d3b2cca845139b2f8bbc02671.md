We are appealing for witnesses following a report of an aggravated burglary in the Stamshaw area of Portsmouth.

The victim, a 58-year-old man, was in his home with a friend at around 7pm on Thursday 6 February when the incident happened.

Three men entered his house on Winstanley Road and threatened him.

The suspects then ran from the address toward Stamshaw Park.

The victim received a minor injury to his hand, and cash and a mobile phone were stolen.

All three of the men were described as being black and between the ages of 16 and 20. They all wore dark clothing, with scarves to cover their faces and hoods or baseball caps on their head.

Were you in the area on the 6 January? Do you remember seeing three men with the description that has been given?

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44200047064.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
