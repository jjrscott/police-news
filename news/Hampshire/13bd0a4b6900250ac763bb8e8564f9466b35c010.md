Officers conducting a routine stop and search of a vehicle have arrested a man on drug offences.

The incident occurred at around 10pm on Monday 14 December after officers noticed a strong smell of cannabis while driving behind a vehicle on Chestnut Drive.

Officers searched the vehicle and seized a quantity of class B drugs.

A 21-year-old man from Southampton was arrested on suspicion of drug-driving but later released under investigation, pending further police enquiries.

Throughout December, officers from our Roads Policing Unit will be carrying out checks for drink and drug drivers as part of Operation Holly. Driving while impaired can have tragic consequences and our message is simple; it's not worth the risk.
