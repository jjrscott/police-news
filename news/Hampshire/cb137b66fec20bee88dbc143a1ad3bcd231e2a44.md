Forty-five people have been reported for summons following a car-meet at the weekend.

Officers were called at around 9pm on Saturday, 27 March, to reports of a car-meet taking place on Rankine Road, Basingstoke, that had travelled from the Thames Valley area.

On attendance around one hundred vehicles were seen, with large groups of people gathered in contravention of the current Health Protection Regulations.

Many left the area on seeing the officers arrive and begin taking details of those in attendance.

As a result, forty-five people were spoken to by attending officers and were reported for summons in relation to a fixed penalty notice.
