Do you recognise this man?

We would like to identify him and speak with him as part of a robbery investigation.

The circumstances are that between 7.50pm and 8pm on Monday 4 May, a man entered the Co-op in Rumbridge Street, Totton, and tried to conceal an item in his jacket.

When challenged by a member of staff, he threatened them with an item described as a Stanley knife before leaving the store with the item.

Officers would like to speak to the man in the image, who has been described as white, between 5ft 8ins and 6ft tall, stocky, with dark shoulder length hair and facial hair, wearing grey jogging bottoms, white trainers, and a dark padded jacket with a hood.

If you know the man pictured, or have any information that could assist our investigation, please call 101, quoting 44200157714.

Alternatively you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org
