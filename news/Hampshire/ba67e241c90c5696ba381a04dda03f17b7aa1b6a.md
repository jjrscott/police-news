We want to speak with them as part of an investigation into an assault in Southampton.

It was reported that some time between 10.55pm and 11.45pm on Thursday 9 July, a man in his 50s was sitting on a bench outside West Quay Shopping Centre on Portland Terrace when he was assaulted by two men he did not know.

This was an unprovoked attack, and the victim sustained face and head injuries that required hospital treatment. He has since been discharged from hospital.

We would like to speak to all five men pictured as they may have information, or have witnessed something relevant to our investigation.

If you know who these people are, please call 101, quoting 44200253853.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org
