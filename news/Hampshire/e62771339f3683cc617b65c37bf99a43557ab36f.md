We are appealing for witnesses after a man sadly died following a collision in Eastleigh involving two vehicles last night (March 1).

Police were called to the collision, involving a blue Ford Fiesta and blue Subaru Impreza, in Allbrook Way at 9.46pm yesterday evening.

Emergency services attended, but the driver of the Fiesta, an 18-year-old from Eastleigh, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

A 34-year-old man from Winchester has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by driving without due care or consideration while over specified limit of a controlled drug.

A 35-year-old woman from Hillingdon, London, was taken to hospital after suffering serious injuries.

Officers are investigating the exact circumstances of the collision and are keen to speak with any witnesses.

If you saw the collision, or have dash cam footage of the collision or either of the vehicles in the Allbrook Way area in the time leading up to 9.46pm, please call 101, quoting 44200078958.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
