Can you help us identify this woman?

We want to speak with her in connection with the theft of a purse at Sainsbury's in Bridge Street, Andover, which happened around 11.30am on December 31.

The purse had been placed on top of a self scan checkout, from where it was taken by another customer.

We know the CCTV image is not the clearest, but hope that someone may recognise the woman and be able to assist our enquiries.

Anyone with information should call 101, quoting the reference 44200501104.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
