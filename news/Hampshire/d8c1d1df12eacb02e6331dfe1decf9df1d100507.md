Last month, we released a CCTV image of two men we'd like to identify as part of an investigation into a robbery in Southsea that happened on Thursday 20 June.
We are now in a position to release a further two CCTV images.

At 12.01am on Thursday 25 June, a 20-year-old man was punched in the face before being threatened by two men.

He was approached on Queens Crescent near to the junction with Sussex Terrace. He was then punched in the face and demands were made for him to hand over his wallet and backpack.

One of the men was believed to have been in possession of a knife.

The men made off with the man's wallet and backpack down Sussex Terrace. A short while later the victim's card was used at an off-licence on Osbourne Road, Southsea.
The victim suffered bruising to the face and did not require hospital treatment.

One of the men was wearing a black baseball cap and a white t-shirt with tan colour shirts. The other was wearing black shorts and a white t-shirt. One of the men was said to be on a bike at the time of the robbery.

These CCTV images are slightly clearer than the one we previously released on June 26. Do you recognise the men pictured?

Anyone with any information is asked to get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200230662.
