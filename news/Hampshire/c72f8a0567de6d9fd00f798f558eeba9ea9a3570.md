Officers investigating a serious assault on a woman in Eastleigh have arrested a man.

The incident happened at approximately 2.15am this morning (4 August) in Leigh Road Park.

A man was seen acting suspiciously by an Eastleigh town centre CCTV operator, after he began following a woman along Leigh Road. The woman was then seriously assaulted by the man. She was taken to Southampton General Hospital and suffered soft tissue bruising as a result.

A 19-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of serious assault and remains in police custody at this time.

We are also investigating an incident in Southsea yesterday evening (3 August), following reports of a serious assault on a woman. The same 19-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of serious assault. We are in the process of investigating both incidents to ascertain if there are any possible links between the two attacks.
