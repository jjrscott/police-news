We are appealing for witnesses or information after a group of friends were assaulted by another group of males at Bourley Lake Reservoir in Aldershot.

The incident occurred between 4pm and 4.30pm on Friday, July 31. The 16 year old victim and his friends were approached by the other group, aged around 17-18, and an argument began.

He and his friends were then punched and kicked and had bottles thrown at them. One of the suspects was said to be holding an extendable baton.

The victim sustained a black eye, bruises and lacerations. His friends have also suffered similar injuries.

Were you in the vicinity of the reservoir on Friday afternoon? Did you witness anything unusual?

If you can help, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200287806.
