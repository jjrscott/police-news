We are appealing for witnesses after a 28-year-old man was assaulted and robbed in Southampton.

The victim was walking in Northumberland Road just before 11pm on Saturday 13 July when he was assaulted by a man who had stopped to talk to him.

It was reported that the man punched the victim in the head, causing him to fall to the ground, before kicking and punching him.

The man then stole the victim's bag which contained a pair of trainers, a white designer jacket, passport, mobile phone and a quantity of cash.

The victim sustained a number of injuries to his upper body including a stab wound to his right shoulder blade suspected to be caused by a small knife.

The man has been described as:

 * White
 * Aged between 30 and 40 years of age
 * Around 5ft 10-12 ins tall
 * Large build
 * Very short dark hair
 * Possibly had a beard
 * Spoke with a local accent

He was described as wearing dark blue jeans, black t-shirt and Nike Air Max trainers.

We are keen to speak to anyone who saw this happen or may have private CCTV/dash cam footage of the incident. This is a believed to be an isolated incident.

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting reference number 44190245082.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
