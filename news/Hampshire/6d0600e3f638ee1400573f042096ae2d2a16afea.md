Officers who executed a warrant in Sherborne St John on Wednesday, uncovered a number of items they believe to have been stolen during burglaries across rural areas.

Officers from Hampshire Constabulary's specialist Country Watch team and Northern Investigations carried out an early morning search on land in Cufaude Lane on July 15, with the help of a police drone which scanned the site.

They found various items suspected to have been stolen including a caravan, quad bikes and power tools. Officers also seized a vehicle suspected to have been involved in criminal offences.

A 34 year old man from Blackwater was arrested on suspicion of burglary and handling stolen goods. He has been released under investigation while police enquiries continue.

 Country Watch Sergeant Stuart Ross said: "We want to reassure residents in the rural districts that offenders who try and carry out criminal activities in the countryside are being robustly targeted by police.

"Rural crime is a priority for us and we will continue to relentlessly pursue suspects and prevent them from using the road networks. If you see any suspicious vehicles or people, please let us know by ringing 101.

"As far as possible, keep high value items such as quad bikes, plant machinery or power tools secured and locked at all times or out of sight. Consider installing CCTV, tracker devices, automatic security lights and intruder alarm systems.

"The community are our eyes and ears and we encourage you to report all incidents as soon as you are able to. And if it's happening there and then, always call 999."
