We're appealing for information as part of an investigation into an attempted robbery in Andover.

The incident took place on the footpath that leads from Shepherds Spring Lane to the Northern Avenue Retail Park, sometime between 7.30pm and 8pm on Thursday 13 August.

The victim, a 57-year-old man, was cycling towards the retail park, when he stopped to repair his bicycle.

He was then approached by a man he did not know, who tried to grab at the victim and his bag of groceries.

The man then walked off towards the retail park. Nothing was stolen and the victim was not injured.

The man is described as:

 * White
 * Aged in his 30s
 * Well built
 * Dark hair
 * Clean shaven
 * Wearing dark-coloured t-shirt and shorts

We are keen to hear from anyone with information about what happened.

In particular, we would like to hear from two men who were seen in the area shortly after the incident took place.

It may be that they saw what happened, or they might have information that could help our investigation.

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the reference number 44200309050.
