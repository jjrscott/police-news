We're appealing for witnesses after a woman suffered puncture wounds when she was bitten by dogs in Winchester.

The woman, in her 50s, had been walking near the bench area to the steps of St Catherine's Hill when she was knocked to the ground by two dogs - described as black Rottweilers.

This took place at around 4.10pm on Sunday 26 July.

The dogs bit the woman several times, causing injuries to her leg and back.

We would like to identify and speak to four people who were at the benches at the time of this incident.

They were two men and two woman, described as all being aged in their late 20s to early 30s, and they had a pushchair with them. They are believed to have left the area with the dogs after the attack.

Did you see these people in the area? Do you know who they are?

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44200280009.
