Officers investigating a racially-aggravated public order incident on a bus in Farnborough are appealing for the victim to make contact with them.

We were called just before 1.30pm on Saturday 1 August to a report of a man being racially abusive to a woman, who was with her two children.

The incident took place on the 1pm Stagecoach bus from Aldershot to Old Dean, but the woman alighted the bus at Kings Mead North bus station before officers arrived.

The woman is described as being black and wearing a black vest top. She was with two children, both of whom were under 10-years-old.

We are keen to speak make contact with her in relation to this incident.

A 51-year-old man, from Camberley, Surrey, has been arrested in connection with the incident on suspicion of racially or religiously aggravated harassment without violence and using threatening or abusive words or behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress.

He has been released under investigation.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting the reference 44200288915.
