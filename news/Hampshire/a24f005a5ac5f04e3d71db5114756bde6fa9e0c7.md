Do you know this man?

We would like to identify him as part of our investigation into a robbery and an attempted robbery that took place in an alleyway between Carisbrooke Drive and Brownlow Avenue in Bitterne.

The first incident happened between 12pm and 12.05pm on 21 November. A woman was walking through the alleyway when she was approached by a man who threatened her with a weapon and demanded money. She handed him her handbag and he ran off.

The second incident occurred between 10am and 10.20am on 25 November when another woman was walking through the same alleyway and was approached by a man who threatened her with a weapon and demanded money. The woman refused to hand anything over and the man ran off. Nothing was stolen.

Neither of the women were injured.

The handbag stolen in the first incident has since been recovered.

Do you recognise the man in these pictures? The CCTV image shows him wearing a distinctive two piece olive green hooded tracksuit, black Nike trainers with a white sole and an over the shoulder pouch.

If you have any information please call us on 101 quoting 44190423536.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
