We are warning the public to be on their guard after a woman had items stolen from her bag in a supermarket carpark in Farnborough.

The 25 year old woman had been shopping in Morrison's in Southwood, Links Way. She came back to her car at around 1pm on July 9 and was approached by a male, described as medium build, Asian and with a heavy accent.

The woman described seeing another man hanging around the same area.

The first male asked her for directions and she believes as she spoke to him, the second man reached inside her car and stole her driving licence and bank cards out of her bag.

If something similar has happened to you or if you have any information about this incident, please call 101, quoting reference 44190238269.
