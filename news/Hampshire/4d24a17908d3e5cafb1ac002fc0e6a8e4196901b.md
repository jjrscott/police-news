We have tonight arrested an 18-year-old man on suspicion of possessing an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, and assault thereby occasioning actual bodily harm.

The arrest comes after we received a number of reports of two people on the roofs of stores in Above Bar Street at 3.41pm today (Aug 29) carrying what looked like long barrelled firearms.

We immediately deployed our armed response units to the area and carried out an extensive search.

One man, a 21-year-old from Southampton, later reported he had been shot in the leg with what we believed to be an air weapon. Luckily his injury is not considered serious.

The 18-year-old man arrested in connection with this incident remains in police custody at this time.

We know there were two people seen on the roofs. Enquiries are ongoing to identify and locate the other person suspected to be involved.

We understand that this incident would have concerned people in the town centre this afternoon. We want to thank those who called us and alerted us to this incident, and those who have come forward as witnesses.

We know there are a number of images circulated on social media. We would ask that you send these to us rather than share them as they may be valuable evidence in this investigation. Please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting 44200332797.
