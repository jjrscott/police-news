A 49-year-old woman from Eastleigh has been reported for summons in relation to a fixed penalty notice after breaching Covid-19 regulations.

This comes after reports of a house party taking place at Nightingale Avenue in Eastleigh, at around 1.30pm on Saturday 27 February.

After a search of the property, officers located eight men from both Eastleigh and Southampton in the garden and an upstairs bedroom of the property.

They were all reported for summons for breaching Covid-19 regulations for consideration of a fixed penalty notice.

Under the current national restrictions you should not be meeting with anyone outside of your household or support bubble, either indoors or outdoors, to limit the spread of Covid-19.

During the search, a large quantity of Class B drugs were located alongside a quantity of cash and other drug-related paraphernalia inside a vehicle seen at the property. Police enquiries are still ongoing at this stage to establish the circumstances involved.
