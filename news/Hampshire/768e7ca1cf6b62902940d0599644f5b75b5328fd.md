Officers from Winchester's Neighbourhood Policing Team have set up a dispersal order as part of a clampdown on anti-social behaviour in the city centre.

The dispersal order will cover an area that includes the High Street, Orams Arbour, Jewry Street, River Park Leisure Centre, Water Lane and the Cathedral Grounds.

It will be in place between 5pm tomorrow (2 October) and 5pm on Sunday 4 October.

The order is in response to reports of anti-social behaviour by groups of people congregating.

It will give officers the power to disperse people involved in anti-social behaviour out of the area, and to seize anything used in the commission of anti-social behaviour.

The Licensing Team will also be working with venues and local partners in conjunction with this dispersal.

Inspector John Stribley said: "We know that anti-social behaviour has a negative impact on those living and working in the area.

"Anyone who witnesses anti-social behaviour or large gatherings of people should call 101 or report it to us online at www.hampshire.police.uk.

"If a crime is in progress, call 999."
