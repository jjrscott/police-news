A Dispersal Order to combat anti-social behaviour in the Townhill Park area of Southampton, has been extended to run for another 48 hours.

This follows reports of anti-social behaviour caused by large groups of people who continue to gather in this area.

Officers from Southampton North Neighbourhood Policing Team set up the dispersal order as part of a clampdown on anti-social behaviour in the Townhill Park and surrounding areas.

The order was initially put in place for 48 hours from 3pm Tuesday to 3pm Thursday of this week, covering locations that include Meggeson Avenue, River Walk, Woodmill Lane and Townhill Way.

The order has now been extended to run for further 48 hours from 3pm this afternoon (Thursday, 7 May) until 3pm Saturday, 9 May in anticipation of large group gatherings.

So far officers patrolling the area have seen large groups of people continuing to gather and disperse on police arrival.

The order gives officers the power to disperse people involved in anti-social behaviour out of these locations.

Those under 16 will be taken be to their home address, and follow-up work will be done with parents.

The order also gives officers the power to seize anything used in the commission of anti-social behaviour.

Acting Chief Inspector Hayley O'Grady said: "We know that anti-social behaviour has a negative impact on those living and working in the area.

"Over the past two days officers have seen groups of people who are still gathering in the area, but have dispersed upon our arrival.

"I would like to thank all those people who have reported incidents to us over the past week.

"Any information from the public can help us build a bigger picture of what is happening, and allows us to plan accordingly.

"Anyone who witnesses anti-social behaviour or large gatherings of people is asked to call 101 or report it to us online at www.hampshire.police.uk.

"If a crime is in progress, call 999.

"This is not related to COVID-19, but of course we would like to remind everyone of the government advice to stay at home: www.gov.uk/coronavirus."
