We are appealing for witnesses or dash cam footage after two cars were in collision on the A272 near Langrish.

The incident occurred at around 1.20pm on Friday, August 9. A silver Ford Kuga travelling towards West Meon was in collision with a red Vauxhall Movano van travelling towards Petersfield.

A 66 year old woman travelling in the Kuga was taken to hospital with injuries. She has sustained stomach and chest injuries but they are not thought to be life threatening. A male in the car was also taken to hospital as a precaution.

Did you see what happened? If you have any information or if you have dash cam footage, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting Operation Notify.
