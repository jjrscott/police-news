Officers investigating the murder of 21-year-old George Allison and the serious assault of a 27-year-old woman in Leigh Park have made four further arrests this week and charged two people.

At around 11pm on Saturday 23 May, police responded to a disturbance at an address in Tichborne Grove.

On arrival, officers found a man and a woman who had both sustained stab wounds. George Allison, from Riders Lane, was pronounced dead at the scene. The 27-year-old woman, from Southsea, sustained serious injuries.

A 33-year-old woman from Havant and a 32-year-old woman from Waterlooville were both arrested this week on suspicion of assisting an offender.

The 33-year-old has been bailed until 25 August, and the 32-year-old has been released from custody but remains under investigation.

In addition, the following two men were arrested and subsequently charged with assisting an offender:

 * Barry Baker, aged 38 years, from Oracle Drive in Waterlooville
 * Lewis Turner, aged 32 years, formerly of Hayling Island.

They have both been bailed to appear at Basingstoke Magistrates' Court on 27 August.

Officers have previously charged a man with murder and causing grievous bodily harm with intent. He is Kevin Joseph Batchelor, aged 25 years, of East Hill, Cambourne, Cornwall.

He is due to go on trial at Winchester Crown Court on 9 November.
