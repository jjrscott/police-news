Criminals who commit offences across the rural areas were targeted during a two-force police operation at the end of last week.

Officers from Hart North and South Neighbourhood Team joined forces over two days with the specialist Country Watch team, Thames Valley's Rural Crime Unit, Roads Policing, the Dog Unit and National Police Air Service helicopter.

As a result of the ongoing operation across North Hampshire and the southern fringes of Thames Valley, a quad bike that had been stolen from a livery in Yateley, was recovered by officers in Hartley Wintney and returned to the owner.

A 27 year old man from Hartley Wintney has been arrested on suspicion of burglary. He has been released under investigation while enquiries continue.

â€‹Hart District Neighbourhood Inspector Jen Lovegrove said: "These regular nights of action are run between Hampshire and Thames Valley Police - using an intelligence led approach. We will use whatever tactics are required to disrupt and detect criminality.

"I would like to assure residents and landowners that we take rural crime extremely seriously. We are conducting patrols in rural areas but we would urge anyone to ensure as far as possible to secure and alarm their buildings and property mark their equipment. Consider installing CCTV, tracker devices, automatic security lights and intruder alarm systems.

"Rural crime is a priority for us and we will continue to relentlessly pursue suspects. The community are our eyes and ears and we encourage you to report all incidents as soon as you are able to by calling 101 if it's not an emergency. If it's happening there and then, always call 999."
