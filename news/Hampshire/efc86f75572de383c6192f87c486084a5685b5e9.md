Two men have been arrested after more than Â£10,000 worth of property was reported stolen by two local businesses.

Earlier yesterday (25 November) we received reports of theft by an employee, from two companies based in Andover, after several high value cycles went missing and were seen for sale online.

A 58-year-old man from Andover was arrested on suspicion of theft by an employee, and a 56-year-old man from Andover was arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods.

A quantity of cash, as well as several of the high-value bikes were seized from their address.

The two men have been released from custody but remain under investigation as enquiries continue.
