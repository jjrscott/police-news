We are appealing for witnesses after a collision involving a Peugeot moped and pedestrian in Southampton yesterday (June 15).

Officers were called just before 5pm following the collision outside the Winston Hotel on Archers Road.

The pedestrian, a man in his 30s, suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital.

Officers investigating the exact circumstances of the collision are keen to speak with anyone who witnessed it.

We are also keen to hear from anyone who has dash cam footage of the incident.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200216223.
