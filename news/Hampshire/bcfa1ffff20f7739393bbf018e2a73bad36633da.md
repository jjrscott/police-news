Officers who were patrolling an Eastleigh shopping centre have charged a man with shoplifting offences.

The charges come after officers witnessed the man take items from the Poundland store without paying on Tuesday 20 October at the Swan Centre on Wells Place.

Piotr Mateusz Taegosz, aged 42, of Cranbury Avenue, Southampton was charged with theft from a shop. He was released on condition bail and is due to appear at Southampton Magistrates Court on Thursday 19 November.
