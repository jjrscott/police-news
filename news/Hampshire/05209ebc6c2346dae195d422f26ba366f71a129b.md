A 49-year-old man from Bishopstoke has been given a conditional discharge order after committing a public order offence in Bishopstoke.

The incident occurred at around 1.13pm on Monday 4 January when an off-duty police officer was threatened by the man who was brandishing a knife, as he crossed Bishopstoke Bridge.

Andrew Humphries, aged 49, of Scotter Road, Bishopstoke pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a bladed article in a public place and one count of using threatening behaviour to cause harm / alarm or distress.

Humphries had chased the off-duty police officer on a number of occasions during the ordeal, while making threats to kill, before he was detained by officers arriving at the scene.

He appeared at Southampton Magistrates Court this morning (5 January) and received a 6-month conditional discharge and was ordered to pay a victim surcharge of Â£22.

The public are reminded to contact 999 if there is an immediate threat to life or if a crime is in progress. Alternatively, they can contact 101 or use Hampshire Constabulary's online reporting tool to report any suspicious activity or if they believe they have been a victim of crime.
