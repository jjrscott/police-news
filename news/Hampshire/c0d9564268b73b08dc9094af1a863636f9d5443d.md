We are appealing for witnesses after commemorative plates were stolen during a burglary in Southampton.

The incident happened between 14 February and 17 February at an address on Millbrook Road East.

Entry was forced to the property and a large amount of special edition commemorative plates were stolen.

Officers have conducted a number of enquiries and are now turning to the public for any information that could help our investigation.

We are releasing images of some of the stolen plates in the hope that someone might have seen them for sale, or know who might have them.

Were you in the area at this time, perhaps you saw something suspicious on Millbrook Road East during the relevant time? Have you seen these commemorative plates for sale?

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 with the reference 44210059594.
