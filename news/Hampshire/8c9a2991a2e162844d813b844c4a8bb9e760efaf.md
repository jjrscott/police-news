**Forty** **knives have been taken off the streets after being placed anonymously in knife bins at the Totland Estate in Farnborough and at Aldershot Police Station.**

** ** **Neighbourhood Inspector Phil Mayne said: "Every knife recovered is potentially a life saved.**

** ** **" The damage and fear caused by the illegal possession, sale and use of knives - to victims of knife crime, their family and friends and the community in general - is impossible to quantify.**

** ** **" We continue to work in partnership with schools, colleges, local councils, other partners and charities such as Fearless.org and Crimestoppers to take this scourge off our streets.**

** ** **" Knife bins are just one of a number of tactics we use but we would encourage anyone who is concerned about someone carrying a knife, or if you are worried that someone could be hurt soon, please let us know, either by calling 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.**

** ** **" If you are a young person concerned about someone carrying a knife, you can tell us without having to say who you are, by reporting anonymously online at Fearless.org.**

** ** **" Parents, teachers and other professionals who want to know how to talk to young people about knife crime, can also find more information at www.safe4me.co.uk."**

** ** **The knife bins at both Totland and Aldershot remain in place so you can safely and anonymously discard them in the bins.**
