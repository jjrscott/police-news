Witness appeal made following dog incident in Stockbridge

We are appealing for information after a four-year-old girl was attacked by a dog at Chilbolton Common.

The incident took place sometime between 5pm and 5.30pm on Sunday 7 July.

The child was with her grandmother and her six-year-old sister.

They were approached by what has been described as a brown and black Rottweiler dog, as they walked on the grassy area near the river.

The dog knocked over the six-year-old girl, before attacking the four-year-old girl.

The four-year-old girl was left with scratches and bruises to her arm, back and neck, and a puncture mark to her arm.

She attended hospital as a precaution.

A man took hold of the dog but did not give any details.

We would like to speak to this man as part of our investigation.

He is described as:

• white
• aged between 35 and 40 years old
• around 5ft 9ins tall
• of slim build
• balding
• wearing a red polo t-shirt and three-quarter-length dark-coloured shorts

Were you on the common that day? We would also like to hear from anyone who witnessed this incident, or anyone who has information that could help our investigation.

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44190236126.
