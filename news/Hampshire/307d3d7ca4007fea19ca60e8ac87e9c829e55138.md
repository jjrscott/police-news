We are appealing for witnesses after a 17-year-old boy died in a single-vehicle collision today on the M275.

The teenager was driving a blue Ford Focus on the M275 slip road joining the M27 westbound when the collision occurred just before 10am this morning.

Sadly, he has been pronounced dead.

His next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers.

Officers are now investigating the exact circumstances of the collision and are keen to speak with anyone who witnessed it.

Were you driving on the M275 at this time? Maybe you have a dash cam in your car and captured the vehicle in the moments leading up to the collision?

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200014162. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
