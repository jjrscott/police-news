We are appealing for witnesses after reports of a man indecently exposing himself in Eastleigh.

The incident occurred on Thursday (19 November) at around 9.30pm on Westfield Road in Velmoore.

As a woman was entering her house she heard a noise that distracted her and as she turned around, saw a man exposing and inappropriately touching himself.

He is described as white, aged 20-30, approximately 5ft 8" tall and average to chubby build.

He was wearing grey tracksuit bottoms, a pale grey zip-up hooded top and a bobble hat.

If you have any information about this incident or you recognise the description of the suspect, please get in touch by calling 101, quoting 44200448902.

Alternatively you can phone independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
