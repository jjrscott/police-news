Have you seen these bronze hare statues recently?

We are appealing for information after they were stolen from the front garden of a house in Church Lane, Goodworth Clatford, near Andover.

It took place sometime between 4pm on Friday 5 July and 9.30am on Saturday 6 July.

The statues are worth between £3,000 and £4,000.

Were you in this area at the time? Did you see anything suspicious? Perhaps you have been offered the statues for sale recently?

Anyone with information should call police on 101, calling the crime reference number 44190234056.
