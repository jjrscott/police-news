We're appealing for witnesses after a pedestrian suffered serious injuries during a collision in Minley near Blackwater.

Police were called at 5.07pm today (Wednesday 13 January) to the A327 Minley Road, half way between the A30 and the Crown & Cushion pub.

A blue Vauxhall Mokka collided with a pedestrian.

The pedestrian, a man in his 30s, sustained life-threatening injuries and was taken to St Georges Hospital in Tooting for treatment.

Closures are in place in the area, but are expected to be lifted shortly.

We would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident and the events leading up to it, or captured anything on Dash Cam.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting incident 1449 of today's date.
