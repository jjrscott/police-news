We are appealing for witnesses after a white Toyota Aygo and a red Vauxhall Astra collided on the A338 Salisbury Road, between Breamore and Downton, just after 2.20pm yesterday (Friday 19 June).

The driver of the red Vauxhall, a 30-year-old man, did not suffer any injuries.

The driver of the white Toyota, an 82-yer-old man from Fordingbridge, suffered life threatening injuries and was taken to hospital.

Sadly, he has since died.

Officers investigating the collision would like to hear from anyone who was in the Salisbury Road area of Fordingbridge yesterday afternoon who may have seen this collision, specifically anyone who was driving in the area who may have captured dash cam footage.

Please call 101 and quote Operation Client, or 44200222443.
