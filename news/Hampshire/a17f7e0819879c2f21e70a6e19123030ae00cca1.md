We have released a CCTV image of someone we would like to speak to in connection with the theft of a Jaguar XK in Marchwood.

Between 4.50am and 5.30am on Thursday 27 June, a house on Bilberry Drive was entered through the front door.

Keys for the Jaguar XK convertible were stolen from inside the house and the car was taken from the driveway.

A number of house and car doors may have been tried in the surrounding area.

The person we would like to speak to is described as:

 * White
 * Male
 * 16-25 years old
 * Wearing a blue hooded top and tracksuit bottoms

If you have any information about this incident, please call 101 quoting 44190221415.

Alternatively you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Householders are reminded to ensure their properties and vehicles are locked and that keys are not left in obvious places. For further advice: https://www.hampshire.police.uk/cp/crime-prevention/residential-burglary/
