We are appealing for witnesses after a collision between a car and a pedestrian in Southampton.

The collision happened at around 7.40am on Friday (16 October), at the entrance to the car-park on Westridge Road.

The pedestrian, a 76-year-old woman, was crossing at the car-park when the collision happened. The car did not stop.

The woman attended Southampton General Hospital to be treated for minor injuries to her back.

Unfortunately we have no description of the vehicle as the woman is blind.

Were you nearby when the collision happened? Perhaps you might have dash-cam footage that could help?

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 with the reference 44200401677. Alternatively, you can phone Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
