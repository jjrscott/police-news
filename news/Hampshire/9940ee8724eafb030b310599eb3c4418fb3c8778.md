A 15-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared at Portsmouth Youth Court today (8 September) for sentence and has been given a 12 month referral order for possession of a bladed weapon after pleading guilty to the offence at Winchester Crown Court at an earlier hearing.

On Tuesday 25 August, a jury at Winchester Crown Court found the 15-year-old not guilty of the murder of James Laurie, 17, from Southampton.

James died following an incident that took place on Lindsay Road, Thornhill, on Sunday, 19 January earlier this year.
