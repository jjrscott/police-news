The family of Frazer Brabant wish to pay the following tribute to him:

Words cannot express the way we feel about losing Frazer.

He was a much loved son, grandson, brother and father who has left behind two little girls, aged 7 and 11.

He fought so bravely and for so long after the devastating attack on him.

Frazer was a very proud father and loved his girls very much but because of his condition in hospital, his daughters were unable to go and say a final goodbye to their daddy.

Nobody deserved what happened to him and it has left our family in utter shock and grief.

We are all heartbroken and our lives will never be the same. He will be forever missed by all his family and friends and we hope he can now rest in peace.

We would ask for respect and privacy at this incredibly difficult time.

The assault occurred on the night of Halloween, October 31. Frazer was found in the rear garden of a residential property in Gershwin Road, Basingstoke, with serious head injuries.

Frazer remained in hospital ever since but passed away on Tuesday, January 21.
