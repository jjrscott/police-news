Three people have been arrested on suspicion of drugs offences after officers carried out two warrants.

This morning (Wednesday 5 August), officers from Southampton's High Harm Team and Southampton Central's Neighbourhood Policing Team executed the warrants at two addresses in Shirley Road.

Drugs and cash were seized.

A 27-year-old man, a 28-year-old man and a 29-year-old man, all from Southampton, were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a Class A drugs and possession of criminal property.

They remain in police custody at this time.

Acting Inspector Allan Dineley said: "The warrants were carried out under Operation Fortress, Hampshire Constabulary's ongoing campaign to reduce drug related harm.

"Drug supply can often be linked to a variety of other crimes, like theft, burglary, robbery and serious violence, which is why it is so vital we identify the root of the issue.

"I'd like to reassure residents that we are doing all we can to tackle drugs supply in Southampton and keep our communities safe.

"If you suspect that an address in your neighbourhood is being used for drug dealing, drug-related activity or associated crime, then please call 101 or the anonymous Crimestoppers charity on 0800 555 111.

"All information could help us catch and convict those who deal drugs to our communities and even the smallest pieces of information can help us develop a clearer intelligence picture."
