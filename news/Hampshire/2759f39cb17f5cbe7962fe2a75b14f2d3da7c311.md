Police officers investigating reports of theft from a communal bike area in Eastleigh have arrested a man.

The incident occurred on Friday 12 February at around 2.25pm close to properties on Tommy Green Walk, whereby three locked bikes were stolen from a communal bike storage area. These were later seen to be advertised for sale on social media.

The victim contacted the seller to obtain their address and later informed police.

Police arrested a 16-year-old boy from Southampton on suspicion of theft of a pedal cycle but during attempts to arrest him, he assaulted the attending officers. He was subsequently arrested on suspicion of four counts of assaulting an emergency service worker.

A search of the property by officers also resulted in locating a quantity of Class B drugs, and he was further arrested on suspicion of possession of a Class B drug.

He was later released under investigation, pending further police enquiries.
