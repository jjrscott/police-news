We are appealing for anyone with information relating to a burglary in the Cranmore area of the Isle of Wight.

Overnight on Saturday 1 September into Sunday 2 September, a workshop on Ningwood Hill was entered and approximately Â£2,000 worth of tools were stolen, along with a Viking Sword used in re-enactments.

The workshop is situated along the main Newport to Yarmouth road, and we are asking anyone who may have seen someone acting suspiciously or any stationary vehicles in this area, particularly in the early hours of Sunday morning, to call police.

Anyone with information is asked to call us on 101, quoting 44190394205.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
