We're appealing for witnesses following a fail to stop collision in Farnborough that has left a man with life-threatening injuries.

We were called at 9.44am yesterday (October 29) to reports of a collision involving a pedestrian and a van on Fernhill Road.

The pedestrian, a 69 year-old man, from Farnborough, suffered life-threatening injuries and is receiving treatment in Hospital.

The driver of the van failed to stop at the scene and officers are conducting enquiries to locate him.

The van is described as being white Ford Transit Custom van with rear panel tinted windows and red sign writing on the side.

DS Louise Mills said: "This collision has left a man with serious injuries and we urgently need to speak to the driver of the vehicle involved.

"If you were in the area and witnessed the incident, think that you may have any dash cam footage, CCTV or any other relevant information, we really want to hear from you"

Four men have been arrested in connection with this incident and remain in custody at this time.

Anyone with information is asked to contact us on 101, quoting RMS number 44190387935, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
