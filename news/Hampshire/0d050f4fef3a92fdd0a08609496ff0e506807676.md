Officers investigating a robbery in Portsmouth have charged a second person.

The 17-year-old, from Portsmouth, has been charged with robbery in connection with an incident in Bransbury Park on January 3.

It comes after detectives charged Riley Cragg, 21, of Watts Road, Portsmouth, for the same offence earlier this month.

The 17-year-old has been remanded in custody and is due to appear at Portsmouth Youth Court on February 7.
