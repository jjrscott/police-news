We're appealing for witnesses following an assault at a Portsmouth taxi rank last weekend.

Two women reported being punched as they tried to get a taxi outside Debenhams in Palmerston Road, just after midnight on September 8.

One of the women, a 50-year-old, reported being dragged from a taxi by a woman, who arrived at the taxi rank with a group of people.

The victim was then punched by a man. He is also reported to have punched a 34-year-old woman who was with the victim.

The man was with a group of nine other people. He is described as being white, around 5ft 5ins tall, with short brown cropped hair and aged in his 30s. He was wearing a blue t-shirt which he had taken off during the incident.

Fortunately the women were not seriously injured.

Did you see the incident involving two groups of people outside of Debenhams at the taxi rank?

Anyone with information is asked to call us on 101, quoting 44190323659, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
