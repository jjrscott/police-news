A third man arrested in connection with an incident in Alton where a 24 year old man sustained serious injuries, has been bailed while police continue their enquiries.

The assault happened just after midnight on 26 July, on the High Street, Alton, close to the Vodafone store.

 Following an altercation, a 24-year-old man was taken to Southampton General Hospital with head injuries. He remains in a critical condition.

The 26 year old man from Alton who was arrested on July 27, was released on conditional bail yesterday.

 All three were arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.
