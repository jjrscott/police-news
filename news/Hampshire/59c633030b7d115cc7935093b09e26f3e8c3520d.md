Officers investigating a series of thefts from motor vehicles across the New Forest have arrested a 44-year-old man from Totton.

Since the beginning of August there has been an increase in theft from motor vehicles - predominantly work vans being targeted - in the Ringwood and Hythe areas.

A person of interest was identified by officers as driving a blue Renault Megane, which was stopped by specialist officers yesterday (26 August) in Hammond Lane, Totton.

Upon searching the vehicle, a wide-range of tools were located which are being linked to these burglaries.

A 44-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary. He remains in police custody at this time.
