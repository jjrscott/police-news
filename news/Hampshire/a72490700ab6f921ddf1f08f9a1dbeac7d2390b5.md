We are appealing for witnesses after three males attempted to steal a mobile phone and ear phones from a 16-year-old boy in Southampton.

The boy was walking on Blechynden Terrace at 5.10pm last Sunday (February 2) when he was approached by them.

When they demanded the teenager hand over his phone, he initially gave it to them, before grabbing it back and leaving the scene.

Officers investigating the incident are keen to speak with anyone who witnessed the three black males approach the boy on Sunday, or who saw them in the area between 5pm and 5.30pm.

We also want to speak with a woman who spoke to the 16-year-old boy outside student accommodation around this time, as we believe she may be able to assist us.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200041633. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
