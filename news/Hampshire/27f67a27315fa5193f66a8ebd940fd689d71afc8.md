A 28 year old Aldershot woman has been jailed for 16 weeks after admitting stealing just over £700 worth of goods from Boots in the town centre.

Chelsea Ward-Smith, of Grosvenor Road, Aldershot, admitted shoplifting from the shop in the Wellington Centre on several dates in August, targeting cosmetics and skincare products totalling £705.

Ward-Smith appeared virtually before Basingstoke Magistrates Court where she was also ordered to pay £100 compensation.
