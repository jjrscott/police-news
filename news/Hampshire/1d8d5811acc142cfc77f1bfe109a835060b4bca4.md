Officers who stopped a motorcyclist for dangerous and erratic driving have arrested a man for drug-related offences.

The incident occurred at 11.40am on Friday 16 October on Maddoxford Lane, when officers pulled off a motorcyclist due to the nature of his driving.

Upon speaking with the rider, officers conducted a search of the individual after they noticed a strong smell of cannabis was present.

In searching the rider's backpack officers seized an amount of herbal cannabis, a quantity of cash along with a mobile phone.

An 18-year-old man from Waltham Chase was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a Class B drug.

He was released under investigation, pending further enquiries.
