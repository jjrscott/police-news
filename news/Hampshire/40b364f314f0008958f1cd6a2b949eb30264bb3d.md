Officers have charged a 17-year-old boy with possession of an offensive weapon in a public place.

The charge comes after it was reported two young men were causing a disturbance outside a home on Cheltenham Gardens in Hedge End at 1.37pm on Friday 15 January.

The boy, from Southampton, was later arrested and charged.

He will appear before Southampton Youth Court court on January 21.
