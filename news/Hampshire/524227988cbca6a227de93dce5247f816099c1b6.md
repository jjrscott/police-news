A 33-year-old man has been jailed for three years following a burglary on Worthing Road, Southsea, earlier this year.

Michael John Smith, aged 33, of Foster Road in Portsmouth, admitted the break-in on Worthing Road that happened on 16 January this year.

He was yesterday (20 May) sentenced to three years in prison via a video link to Portsmouth Crown Court.

He plead guilty to the burglary and admitted a further four burglaries which were taken into consideration.

The court heard how he forced entry into the property by smashing the rear kitchen window, and proceeded to steal antique jewellery that was of sentimental value to the victim.

Smith was identified after a forensic examination found his blood at the scene. He was arrested by police on 14 February.

PC Charlotte Pocock, who works on Operation Hawk, said: "Residential burglaries are understandably very distressing for the victims.

"Michael Smith showed no regard for the victim's property, I hope this result gives them closure.

"I am pleased with this result, and I hope it assures our communities that we take these offences very seriously."
