Can you help us identify this young woman?

We believe she may be able to help us with our investigation into a serious sexual assault against a man in East Park in Southampton that happened in the early hours on Sunday morning (October 27).

The 29-year-old man reported he was sexually assaulted near the entrance to the park at the top of Above Bar Street. After the attack at 6.55am the man went into the Starbucks on Above Bar Street and began speaking to a young woman.

The young woman, who we believe is captured here on CCTV entering Starbucks before the victim at 6.35am, spoke to the man and bought him a cup of tea.

The man reported the sexual assault to police about an hour later, which is said to have occurred between 2.54am and the time he entered Starbucks.

Officers investigating the case are really keen to speak to this young woman.

Is this you? You could have information that could assist our investigation.

Please call 101 and quote 44190385107.
