Officers have arrested a man following a report of an attempted burglary at a high street store in Southampton.

We were called at 3.18am this morning (Thursday, 4 June), to a report of an attempted burglary at Boots on Above Bar Street, Southampton.

Officers attended shortly afterwards and arrested a 23-year-old man from Southampton on suspicion of going equipped and attempted burglary.

He remains in police custody at this time.
