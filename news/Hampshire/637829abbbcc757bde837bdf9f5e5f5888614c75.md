Officers from Hampshire Constabulary's Roads Policing Unit, including specialist officers from their Commercial Vehicle Unit and the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency, uncovered a wide-range of motoring offences at Rownham Services yesterday (14 December).

These included offences ranging from overweigh vehicles and vehicles with defects to driving licence and VEL offences.

A total of 30 vehicles were stopped at the M27 on Monday 14 December as part of an operation incorporating Operation Holly - a campaign targetting motorists who take to the roads while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of both. Officers also sought to target vehicles which were not deemed roadworthy during the operation.

Two thirds of the vehicles that officers encountered were dealt with in some way, whether that was a verbal warning, tickets for offences or via prohibitions

The offences witnessed by officers included;

• A motorist with previous driving hour offences

• Two of the motorists breathalysed, were under the drink-drive limit, but were spoken to about driving the moring after drinking alcohol

• Two vehicles seized for no tax or driving otherwise than in accordance with their licence

• Three trailers had non-operational lights

• Four vehicles with offences relating to tyres

• Five vehicles were overweight in relation to restrictions placed upon their classification of vehicle

Throughout December, officers from our Roads Policing Unit will be carrying out checks for drink and drug drivers as part of Operation Holly. Driving while impaired can have tragic consequences and our message is simple; it's not worth the risk.
