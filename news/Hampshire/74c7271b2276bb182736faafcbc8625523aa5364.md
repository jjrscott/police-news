Were you in London Street, Andover, at around 5am on Saturday 27 July?

If so, you may have information that could help our investigation into a burglary at a barbers.

Sometime between 5.10am and 5.30am, a man entered the Town Barber Shop.

Money was then taken from the till.

An investigation is underway and officers are making enquiries.

The man is described as wearing a dark coloured hat, a brown puffy jacket with a hood, dark coloured trousers and trainers with white soles.

We would like to hear from anyone who was in this area at the time.

In particular, we are keen to hear from two young men who were seen attempting to get a taxi in this area before walking past the barbers.

They may have witnessed or have information about what happened which could help our enquiry.

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44190263677.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
