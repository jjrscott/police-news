The third incident was reported on the morning of Monday 20 January. The body of a sheep was found in the Wittensford Lane area of Cadnam. Enquiries are ongoing to establish the details of this incident.

As part of their enquiries, officers will look to see if there are any links between these sheep deaths, and with any other similar incidents in the New Forest.

Targeted patrols of areas in the New Forest will continue.
