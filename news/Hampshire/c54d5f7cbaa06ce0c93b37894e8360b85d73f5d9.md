Fifty knives have been taken off the streets after being placed anonymously in knife bins at the Totland Estate in Farnborough and at Aldershot Police Station.

Rushmoor Sergeant Phil Mayne said: "Every knife recovered is potentially a life saved.

"The damage and fear caused by the illegal possession, sale and use of knives - to victims of knife crime, their family and friends and the community in general - is impossible to quantify.

"We continue to work in partnership with schools, colleges, local councils, other partners and charities such as Fearless.org and Crimestoppers to take this scourge off our streets.

"Knife bins are just one of a number of tactics we use but we would encourage anyone who is concerned about someone carrying a knife, or if you are worried that someone could be hurt soon, please let us know, either by calling 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

"If you are a young person concerned about someone carrying a knife, you can tell us without having to say who you are, by reporting anonymously online at Fearless.org.

"Parents, teachers and other professionals who want to know how to talk to young people about knife crime, can also find more information at www.safe4me.co.uk."

The knife bins at both Totland and Aldershot remain in place so you can safely and anonymously discard them in the bins.
