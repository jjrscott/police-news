Police are appealing for witnesses and information after a man wearing a balaclava and carrying a hammer, robbed a Co-op store in Horndean at the weekend.

The incident occurred at 9.50pm on Saturday, July 27, at the Catherington Lane store.

The suspect, who was carrying a claw hammer, entered the shop and demanded staff fill two shopping baskets with cigarettes. He then used the hammer to break the chain to a pink plastic charity box and stole that too.

He left the store with the baskets, turning left down Catherington Lane.

The suspect is described as being a white male, around 5'7" tall, of slim build, and aged around late 20s to early 30s. He was wearing a black balaclava, a green puffa jacket with a grey top underneath and white or grey trainers. He was also wearing blue or purple gloves.
