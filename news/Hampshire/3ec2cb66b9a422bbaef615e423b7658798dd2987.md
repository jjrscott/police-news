A woman has been charged in connection with the death of a new born baby girl found in an Aldershot park in May 2017.

Babita Rai, 23, is charged with murder and appeared before Winchester Crown Court today (Wednesday).

She has been remanded in custody until a pre-trial hearing on August 19 at Winchester Crown Court.

The baby girl's body was found in bushes in Manor Park at around 1.30pm on Friday 19 May 2017.

Detective Chief Inspector David Storey said: "We know that this case was upsetting for a lot of people within the community. We want to reassure you that our officers are trained to deal with sensitive investigations and we will continue to do what is needed to get the right outcome for all those involved."
