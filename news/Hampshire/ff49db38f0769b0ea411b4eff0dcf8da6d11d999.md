We are appealing for witnesses after a woman died following a collision involving a pedestrian and a car on Monday afternoon (March 23).

We were called at 3.37pm following the collision in Haydock Close, Totton, involving a Volkswagen Tiguan and a 74-year-old woman.

The woman, from Totton, suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital. Sadly, she has now died.

Officers are making enquiries into the exact circumstances of the collision and are keen to speak with any further witnesses they have not already spoken to.

Maybe you were in the area, or your car has a dash cam that continues to record when the vehicle is parked?

Anyone with information is asked to call 101, quoting the reference 44200108245.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
