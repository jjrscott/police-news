Officers investigating thefts from businesses in Portsmouth have charged a man.

Ian Hillier, 19, of Lindon Road, Bognor Regis, West Sussex, has been charged with two counts of theft from a shop and two counts of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause fear of or provoke unlawful violence.

He has also been charged with one count of using threatening or abusive words or behaviour to cause harassment, alarm or distress.

This follows police being called to Co-op stores in Fawcett Road and Devonshire Avenue, Southsea on July 14.

Mr Hillier has been bailed to appear at Portsmouth Magistrates' Court on October 27.

The investigation is part of Operation Monster, which is focused on tackling the harm and impact of shoplifting on businesses in Portsmouth.
