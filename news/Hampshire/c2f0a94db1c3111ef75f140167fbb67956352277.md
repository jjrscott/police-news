We are appealing for dash cam footage after a fail to stop collision on the A340 in Tadley on Monday 16 December.

A white Ford Focus made off from police at Pamber End and, after a short pursuit along the A340, it was in collision with a bus stop sign near Manse Lane at about 11am.

The driver left the scene and we are trying to locate him.

If you have footage from before or after the collision - or any other information about this incident - please call 101 quoting 44190451055.
