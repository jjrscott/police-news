We are appealing for witnesses after money was stolen from the Mandarin Chef Restaurant in Crampmoor.

Officers are investigating after a member of staff disturbed someone who had entered the upstairs flat above the restaurant around 8.30pm yesterday (January 25).

When the flat was checked, it was discovered a sum of money had been stolen from the address.

The thieves fled the scene after being disturbed.

We are keen to hear from anyone who may be able to assist our investigation following the theft.

Maybe someone you know has more money than usual? Perhaps you were driving past the restaurant in Winchester Road around 8.30pm and have a dash cam that could have captured people entering or leaving the flat?

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200031606. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
