We are investigating after a woman reported being robbed in Fratton Road, Portsmouth.

It took place sometime between 2pm and 3pm on Tuesday 13 August.

The victim, a 40-year-old woman, withdrew money from the Polski Sklep shop and walked south towards the junction with Lucknow Street.

A man punched her from behind, causing her to fall to the pavement. He took the money she was carrying out of her hand. Around £300 was taken.

The man ran off eastwards in the direction of Manchester Road.

The man is described as:

• black
• around 5ft 2ins tall
• of slim build
• short, cropped hair
• tattoo on the right side of his neck that looked like a fish
• wearing shorts, white socks and black sandals

We are keen to hear from anyone who saw what happened, or who remembers seeing the man as described.

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44190287186.
