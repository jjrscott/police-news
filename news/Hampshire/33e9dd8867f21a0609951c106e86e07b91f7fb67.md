We are appealing for witnesses and information following an assault on a man in his 40s in Aldershot.

The assault took place at around 2.40am in the early hours of Saturday, October 10, in the vicinity of Victoria Road. Four men are believed to have been involved. They are believed to have been travelling in a silver 4 x 4 vehicle. The victim suffered a punctured lung, abrasions and bruising.

Officers are appealing to anyone who was in the vicinity at the time - particularly anyone who was driving in the area and has dash cam footage. If you can help, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting 44200393081.

A 17 year old man from London has been arrested in connection with this incident and released on bail while enquiries continue.
