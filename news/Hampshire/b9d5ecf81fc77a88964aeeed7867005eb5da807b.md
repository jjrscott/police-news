Detectives are appealing for information following a report of an aggravated burglary at a house in Winchester.

The incident took place in Longhouse Green at around 10pm on Thursday 27 August.

Three masked men entered the house and threatened two people inside - a 17-year-old boy and a 14-year-old girl.

They took an iPhone before leaving the house. The iPhone has since been recovered.

The boy and the girl did not receive any injuries.

All three men were described as wearing balaclavas, gloves and dark clothing.

An investigation is underway.

Officers would like to hear from anyone who was in the Longhouse Green area at around 10pm on Thursday 27 August and saw anything suspicious.

Anyone with information should call 101, quoting the reference number 44200330576.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
