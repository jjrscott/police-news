One of the men was holding a handgun and the other man was holding a zombie knife.

The two men threatened the victim before taking his wallet containing cash and ID documents, a Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and driving off in the victim's car, a Ford Fiesta, registration KJ54 KLM.

The first man is described as:

 * Black

Officers have been following several lines of enquiry and are now in a position to release these e-fit images of two men they would like to speak to in connection with this incident.
