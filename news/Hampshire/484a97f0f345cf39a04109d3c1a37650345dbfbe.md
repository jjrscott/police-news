We are appealing for witnesses after a woman was assaulted on Byron Road, Southampton.

The victim, a 30-year-old woman from Southampton, was walking on Byron Road when she was approached and assaulted by a man.

She sustained injuries during the assault, they are not considered serious or life-threatening.
