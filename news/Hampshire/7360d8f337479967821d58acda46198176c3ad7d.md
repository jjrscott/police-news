We would like witnesses to come forward as part of an investigation into a collision in Military Road, Gosport.

The collision involved a blue Jaguar car and a blue Ford Focus, and took place around 4.45pm on Saturday 27 February.

The driver of the Jaguar sustained minor injuries and was treated at the scene by paramedics.

The blue Ford Focus had been reported stolen from an address in Weevil Lane earlier that day.

A 20-year-old man and a 21-year-old man, both from Gosport, were arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle. The 20-year-old man was released with no further action and the 21-year-old man was released from custody but remains under investigation.

We are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed this collision.

Perhaps you were driving in the area and have dashcam footage of the collision or of any of the vehicles prior to this incident?

Do you have any other information that may assist our investigation.

If so, please call 101, quoting the reference number 44210074557.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
