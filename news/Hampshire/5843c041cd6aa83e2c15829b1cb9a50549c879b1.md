A man has been charged after several bottles of alcohol were smashed inside a Portsmouth shop.

Neil Stevens, 66, of Waverley Road, has been charged with causing criminal damage and for breaching a Criminal Behaviour Order.

It comes after officers were called to the Co-op store on Albert Road at 6.30pm yesterday (May 6) following reports of a man who had come into the store and started dropping bottles of alcohol onto the floor.

Mr Stevens is due to appear at Portsmouth Magistrates Court today (May 7).

Despite the ongoing pandemic, our officers in the city remain committed to tackling crime and protecting our residents and businesses - this work never stops.
