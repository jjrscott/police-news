We're appealing for witnesses following a serious collision in Otterbourne this afternoon, in which a 58-year-old man was seriously injured.

We were called shortly after 12.30pm today, Saturday, 28 March, following the collision involving a blue New Holland tractor and a red MG B sports car on Poles Lane, outside Otterbourne golf course.

The driver of the MG B sports was taken to Southampton General Hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries.

The driver of the tractor was uninjured.

We believe a small dark coloured vehicle overtook the tractor just prior to the collision, heading towards Hursley.

Officers making enquiries into the exact circumstances of the collision are keen to speak to the driver of the small dark coloured vehicle.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you see what happened? Maybe you have a dash cam in your car which captured the incident?

Anyone with information should call us on 101, quoting 44200113292.
