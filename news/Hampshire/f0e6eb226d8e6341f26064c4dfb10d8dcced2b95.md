Our investigation into an assault at the Ham Lane/Elson Road junction in Gosport continues, and we are now releasing an E-fit.

It was reported that an 18-year-old woman from Fareham was assaulted at around 7.10am on Monday 14 December.

She sustained injuries during the assault, but they are not considered serious or life-threatening.

Earlier this week we arrested a 21-year-old man on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He has since been released with no further action, and we are asking anyone who recognises the person in the E-fit to contact us.

Do you know this person? Do you have any information about this incident?

Anyone with information is asked to call 101, and quote 44200481032.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
