Detectives investigating a spate of burglaries have charged Graham William Hill, aged 38, of no fixed address with seven offences.

The charges come after homes on Brookvale Road, Winchester Road and Radway Road in Southampton were targeted between July and October 2019.

In some cases, the same home was targeted twice.

Hill has been charged with seven burglaries and will appear before Southampton Magistrates Court today (October 16).
