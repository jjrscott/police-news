We know this image isn't of the best quality but do you recognise any of these people?

We would like to speak to them in connection with two robberies by a group of males who used a claw hammer to threaten two victims.

The first incident occurred at 2.30am on February 23 at the crossroads between Reading Road North and Harlington Way, Fleet.

A 32 year old man was approached by the group who asked for his wallet and phone. They threatened him with the hammer and swung it towards him. The victim lifted his arm to protect himself and was struck by the hammer, causing bruising to his elbow. He gave them his wallet and phone before they made off down Harlington Way.

The stolen cards were later used at a petrol station shortly after.

The second incident happened around half an hour later near Domino's Pizza on Reading Road North in Fleet.

The 28 year old victim was approached by a group of males. One of the group was carrying a hammer. The victim was told to give them all his possessions and he was struck on the back with the hammer, causing soreness.

The victim threw his wallet on the floor before running off.
