Officers investigating an assault in Aldershot are appealing for witnesses.

The incident happened on Selbourne Avenue, between 6.45pm and 9pm on Tuesday 22 December.

The victim, a 37-year-old man, sustained serious injuries from the assault.

A 26-year-old man from Aldershot was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent. He has been released from custody but remains under investigation.

We have conducted a number of enquiries over the past week but are now turning to the public for help.

Were you in the area at the time? Perhaps you drove past and have dash-cam footage of the assault?

We are particularly keen to speak to a group, one man and two women, who helped the victim and drove him to a local medical centre.

Anyone with information can phone 101 with the reference 44200495109. Alternatively, you can phone Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
