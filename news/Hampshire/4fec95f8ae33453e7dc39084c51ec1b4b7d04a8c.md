We are appealing for witnesses after a robbery in Basingstoke.

The incident happened between 6pm and 6.45pm on Saturday, 27 February on the path near Jefferson Road.

The victim, a 17-year-old boy, was approached by two males, aged 16 to 18. They hit him in the face and pulled him to the ground, where he was kicked. They then searched his bag but they left empty handed.

The victim suffered severe bruising to his face and body.

Those responsible are described as:

 * Aged 16 - 18
 * Around 6ft
 * Black
 * One of medium build and short black hair
 * Another of slim build with long black hair which was tied up

We are appealing for any witnesses to the robbery, or anyone with any information that could help our enquiries, to come forward.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you see what happened, or did you see the offenders in the area?

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 with the reference 44210074752. Alternatively, you can phone Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
