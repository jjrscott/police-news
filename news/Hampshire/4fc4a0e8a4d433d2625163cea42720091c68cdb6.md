A man has been jailed for 21 months after admitting assaulting a man in the street in Gosport.

The 33-year-old victim was hit on the head with a glass during the assault in Military Road, Gosport, on December 8, 2017.

He sustained a skull fracture and a cut above his eye which needed stitches.

On Friday 2 August, Harry Coleborn, 21, of Elson Lane, Gosport, appeared at Portsmouth Crown Court for sentence.

He had admitted one count of inflicting grievous bodily harm at a previous hearing.

The court heard that the victim and a friend were walking back from a pub in Gosport when they were approached by two men.

One of the men, Coleborn, used an empty pint glass to hit the victim over the head.

A 20-year-old man from Gosport was given a conditional caution after the victim's friend was pushed from behind.

Coleborn was sentenced to 21 months' imprisonment.

Detective Inspector Abbie Leeson said: "This was a serious and unprovoked attack with a weapon which left a man with a broken nose.

"We hope this investigation and sentence provides some reassurance that offences like this one won't be tolerated."
