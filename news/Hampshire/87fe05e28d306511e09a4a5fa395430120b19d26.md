Do you recognise the man in this e-fit?

We want to identify him in connection with an indecent exposure in Rotherwick, Hook.

It was reported that shortly after 8pm on Monday, 1 June, a woman was out running and went down a public footpath to the rear of Tylney Park Golf Club in Rotherwick, where a man she did not know, exposed himself and performed an indecent act.

The man is described as being white with a tanned complexion, in his late 20's to early 30's, approximately 6 feet tall and of muscular build.

Enquiries to identify the man have been ongoing and we are now asking the public to help us identify him by releasing this e-fit.

Police Sergeant Martyn Evans said: "This was a distressing experience for the victim, but thankfully she came to no harm.

"This type of incident is extremely rare in this area and I ask people to look at the attached e-fit image and contact me in confidence if you recognise him."

If you know him, or have any information that could assist our investigation, please contact Police Sergeant Martyn Evans at Yateley Police Station on 101, quoting 442001973251, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
