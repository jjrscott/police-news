We are appealing for information to identify three men captured on CCTV at the 02 Store on Shirley High Street on July 18.

Just before 1pm, it was reported three men entered the store and asked staff if they could look at a phone worth Â£1300\. The men grabbed the phone from the member of staff and then took two other demo display phones, and ran out of the store.

Officers investigating the incident would like to hear from anyone who recognises the following descriptions:

**Man 1**
White
5 feet 6 inches
Mid 20's
Slim
Northern accent
Dark blue baseball cap
Full cotton grey tracksuit
White trainers.

**Man 2**
White male
5 feet 6 inches
Mid 20's
Large build
Blue summer style hat
Dark blue jacket
Light t-shirt
3/4 length dark blue shorts
Dark shoes.

**Man 3**
White
5 feet 10 inches
Mid 20's
Grey baseball bat
Grey hoody
Skinny blue jeans
White socks and sandals
Carrying a pair of sunglasses

CCTV from the 02 store shows the men on camera, but the images are somewhat blurry.

Do you recognise the descriptions?
