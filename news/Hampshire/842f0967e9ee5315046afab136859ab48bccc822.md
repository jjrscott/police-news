We're appealing for witnesses following a serious collision on the A272 yesterday afternoon, in which a 53-year-old man was seriously injured.

We were called shortly after 3.30pm yesterday, 8 April, following the collision involving a red BMW S1000RR motorbike and a silver Mercedes B class on the A272 at Hinton Ampner.

Two ambulances and an air ambulance attended and the rider of the motorbike was taken to Southampton General Hospital with serious but not life threatening injuries.

Officers making enquiries into the exact circumstances of the collision are keen to speak with anyone who witnessed the collision, or anyone who saw either vehicle in the minutes before the collision.

Were you in that area at the time? Did you see what happened? Maybe you have dash cam footage that captured the incident?

Anyone with information should call us on 101, quoting the reference 44200125525.
