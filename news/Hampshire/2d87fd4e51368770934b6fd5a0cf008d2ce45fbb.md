Do you recognise this man?

We are looking to speak with him in connection to an armed robbery at the 3s Convenience Store on North End Avenue, Portsmouth.

The incident happened at around 8.50pm on Wednesday 9 December.

The victim, a 26-year-old man from Portsmouth, was at work in the store when a man entered armed with what is believed to be a black handgun and demanded the till be opened.

Nothing was stolen during the incident.

Officers have conducted a number of enquiries and are now turning to the public for help in identifying the man in this image.

He is described as being white, around 30-years-old, 5ft 9ins to 6ft tall and of a slim build. He was wearing a black jacket with a hood, and dark trousers.

Were you in the area at the time? Perhaps you know who this man is?

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 with the reference 44200475720.
