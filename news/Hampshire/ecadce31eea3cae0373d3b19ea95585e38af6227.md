We are appealing for witnesses following an unprovoked assault on a delivery driver in Derby Road, Southampton.

The incident occurred at 4.35pm on Monday, June 8. The driver, who is in his 30s, was delivering a parcel to a property when he was assaulted by two men, which resulted in the victim sustaining cuts and bruises.

The two men then made off in a car described as a red Honda.

The victim was taken to hospital as a precaution but thankfully his injuries do not appear to be serious.
