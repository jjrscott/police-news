We're appealing for information and private CCTV after six vehicles were tampered with in the Peartree and Merryoak areas in the early hours of this morning (19 February).

Between 3.30am and 4.30am, Friday 19 February, we received reports of a group of three to four males acting suspiciously in the Gainsford Road, Mortimer Road and Blackthorn Road areas.

Officers attended and upon their arrival, a group of males ran off. Officers carried out an extensive search of the area but were unable to locate them.

Six vehicles were tampered with, two of which had loose change stolen from inside them. It is believed all the vehicles targeted had been left unlocked.

Do you live in the Gainsford Road, Mortimer Road, Blackthorn Road or surrounding areas? Did you see a group of males acting suspiciously or did you hear anything?

Do you have any private CCTV that may have captured something?

If you think you can help us please call 101, quoting 44210062268, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

We would like to take this opportunity to remind vehicle owners to ensure their vehicles are locked, and valuables are not left inside.
