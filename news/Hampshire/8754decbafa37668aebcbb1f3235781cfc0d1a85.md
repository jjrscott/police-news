Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward following an incident of criminal damage at Freespace skate park on Stoney Croft Rise, Eastleigh.

The incident was reported to us at around 10.20am on Monday 23 November, but it is likely to have occurred earlier that morning, when a construction vehicle was driven onto Stoney Croft Rise causing significant damage to the skate park.

Two bollards near to the entrance have been driven through, allowing the digger access to the skate park.

Damage has been caused to a flood light, fencing and the surrounding grounds - which included several skate ramps being bulldozed into a sunken ramp on the premises. The truck was then driven into and wedged in the sunken skate ramp.

Officers have made initial enquiries but are now turning to the public for their help.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you see what happened? Perhaps you have dash-cam footage of the vehicle before it arrived at the skate park on Stoney Croft Rise?

Anyone with information relating to this incident is asked to call 101, quoting reference 44200452971.

Alternatively you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
