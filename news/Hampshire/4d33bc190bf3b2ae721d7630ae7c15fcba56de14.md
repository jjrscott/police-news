We are appealing for any witnesses to a collision on the A27 between Farlington and Havant, at around 4.30pm on Monday 1st June.

A black Ford Fiesta was in collision with a light brown coloured HGV, causing the HGV to lose control and fall over onto its side and block the road.

Both drivers sustained minor injuries.

Officers investigating the collision have conducted a number of enquiries and are now turning to the public for help.

Were you on the road at time and perhaps you witnessed the moments before the collision? Do you have any dash-cam footage of the incident?

We are also keen to hear from anyone who saw a Burgundy VW Passat with a roof rack that may have been driving erratically before the collision.

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101, and quote the reference number 44200196122. Alternatively, you can phone Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
