Do you recognise this man?

We are appealing for information following reports of a number of garages being broken into near Greenways, Milford-on-Sea.

The incident occurred at sometime between 11pm on Thursday 7 January and 6.30am on Friday 8 January.

A number of garages locks have been cut to gain access to them, but it does not appear that anything has been stolen at this stage.

A dark blue or black Ford Fiesta was seen in the area at the time with three men inside, similar to that seen on the CCTV.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you see what happened? Perhaps you have further CCTV or dash-cam footage near to the scene.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101, quoting 44210008033.

Alternatively you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
