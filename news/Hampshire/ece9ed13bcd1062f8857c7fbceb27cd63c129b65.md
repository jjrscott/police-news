We are looking for witnesses and information after an 18 year old man was punched by three males who robbed him near Burger King in Aldershot.

The victim was sat on grass by the small park near Burger King in Cassino Close, at around 3.30pm on May 23, when he was approached by three males. One of them punched the victim twice on the nose and another made threats before they stole a quantity of cash and make off.

We are particularly appealing to a man and woman who intervened and looked after the victim before taking him home.

The first suspect is described as being a white male of medium build, aged between 15 and 16, with dark blonde hair tucked under a green baseball cap. He was wearing a black body warmer with a blue top underneath.

The second suspect is described as being aged between 18 to 20, a white male around five feet eleven inches to six feet tall. He had tanned skin and a short beard or stubble on his chin and cheeks. He was wearing grey clothing.

There is no description of the third suspect.
