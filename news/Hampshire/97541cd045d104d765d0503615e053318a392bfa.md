Police officers carrying out a routine stop check on a vehicle in Chandler's Ford have arrested three people in connection with drug offences.

The incident occurred in the early hours of Sunday 28 February when officers were on patrol in Meon Crescent, Chandler's Ford. The officers conducted a vehicle check on a black BMW which had pulled into the road and was seen to pull up outside an address.

Officers spoke to the driver of the vehicle, who had asked for directions, and a search uncovered a quantity of Class A drugs upon them.

A subsequent search of the vehicle, with the support of local dog units, located a rucksack which contained a quantity of Class A drugs. These were seized while two other passengers in the vehicle were searched by officers.

A 22-year-old man from Chandler's Ford, a 25-year-old man from Southampton and a 22-year-old woman from Eastleigh were arrested on suspicion of possession of a Class A drug with intent to supply.

They were later released under investigation, pending further police enquiries.
