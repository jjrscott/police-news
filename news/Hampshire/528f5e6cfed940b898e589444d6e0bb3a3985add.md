We are appealing for witnesses after two people were threatened with a weapon in Alton.

The incident happened just before 5pm on 29 December in the Alton Railway Station car-park on Station Road.

The victims, an 18-year-old man and a 16-year-old boy, were in the car park when a black BMW pulled up and threatened them with a weapon through the window.

The man in the car is described as being white, aged between 22 and 28-years-old, with brown hair and a dark coloured beard. He was wearing a black puffa jacket.

Were you in the area at the time? Perhaps you have dash-cam footage of a black BMW in the railway station area at the relevant time?

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 with the reference 44200499012. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
