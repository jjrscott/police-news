We are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a large amount of cash was stolen from an ATM during a re-stock on Commercial Road at 10.52am on Wednesday 28 October.

The incident happened when two men approached the ATM re-stocking staff inside the Co-op store. They made threats towards the staff and demanded they hand over the cash cassette box that was due to re-stock the ATM.

The men then left the scene with the cash box in a white Ford transit van.

Luckily, no one was injured.

We deployed to the area at the time of the incident and carried out a search for the van.

Our enquiries are ongoing.

Officers investigating the robbery would like to hear from anyone who was on Commercial Road between 10.30am and 11am on Thursday morning who may have been in the Co-op, seen this van in the area or witnessed this incident.

Furthermore, if you were driving through at this time and have dash cam, please get in touch. The footage you have captured could prove vital to this investigation.

Please call 101 and quote 44200418410.

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 11 and leave information anonymously.
