We are appealing for witnesses after a cyclist received minor injuries in a collision on Three Maids Hill.

The collision happened between 3.38pm and 4.44pm yesterday, 18 February, on the Three Maids Hill roundabout on the A34 near to Winchester.

The cyclist, a 76-year-old man, was travelling across the roundabout when a van attempted to overtake him. The van and cyclist were in collision, causing the cyclist to fall from his bike and lose consciousness.

The van failed to stop at the scene of the collision.

We are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision, or anyone with information that could help in our enquiries.

We are particularly keen to hear from anyone who can help us to identify the van and the driver. It is described as a goods vehicle, similar to a Mercedes Sprinter or Volkswagen Crafter, in a silver or white colour with writing on the back and possibly the sides. It could have damage to the back nearside quarter.

Were you on the road at the time? Perhaps you have dash cam footage of a van matching this description?

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 with the reference 44210061653. Alternatively, you can phone Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
