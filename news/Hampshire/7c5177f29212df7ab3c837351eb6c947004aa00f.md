We are appealing for witnesses after a 62-year-old man died following a serious traffic collision on the B2177 Winchester Road, Upham.

The incident happened just after 6am on Saturday, 30 May. The man was driving a Grey Nissan Leaf when it left the carriageway and was in collision with a tree.

Despite the best efforts of the ambulance crew, he was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

His next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers.

We are investigating the exact circumstances of the collision and are keen to speak to anyone with information.

Were you in the area at the time? Perhaps you saw the vehicle in the run up to the collision?

If you have any information, or dash cam footage, please get in touch on 101 quoting Op Account or the reference 44200192554.
