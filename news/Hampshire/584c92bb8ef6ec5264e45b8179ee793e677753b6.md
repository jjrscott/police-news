We are appealing for information and dash cam footage to assist us in identifying a group of men who robbed a couple in Lymington yesterday (Thursday 27 February).

The incident happened at 6.22pm on Stopples Lane.

A 47-year-old woman and 54-year-old man in a parked vehicle were approached by a group of four men with their faces covered.

The men assaulted the woman before stealing both the man's and woman's watches, and other personal items.

The men then left in a vehicle described as a Honda Civic with the vehicle registration CE08 UAA or similar.

The woman has since received hospital treatment for a suspected broken jaw.

Officers deployed to the scene and conducted a search of the area and a team of detectives will continue the investigation today.

No one has been arrested at this time however officers continue to scope CCTV and carry out house to house visits.

Detective Sergeant Jamie Wiseman from the Western Investigation Team said: "We will be in the area today carrying out a number of enquiries. We really want to hear from anyone who was in the Stopples Lane area last night who saw a vehicle matching this description, or drivers who may have dash cam footage of this car."

"Anyone with information is asked to call 101 and quote 44200075102."
