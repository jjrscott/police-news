We are appealing for witnesses after a woman and five month old baby were injured following a collision in Farnborough yesterday (November 9).

Police were called just before 4.45pm to a collision involving a silver Ford KA and the woman and baby, who were pedestrians, on Summit Avenue.

The woman, in her 30s, suffered injuries to her right leg. The baby boy sustained minor injuries to his head.

Officers are making enquiries into the exact circumstances of the collision.

Anyone who witnessed the incident, or who has dash cam footage from the area, should call 101, quoting 44200434763.

We are particularly keen to speak with a man who stopped at the scene and assisted in moving the Ford KA.
