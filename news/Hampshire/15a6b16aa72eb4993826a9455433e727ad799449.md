We are appealing for witnesses after a man was seriously injured during a robbery attempt in Southsea.

Between 10.30pm and 11pm on 8 December the 66-year-old victim, who is deaf, was walking along Norfolk Street when he was assaulted from behind by three men.

The victim was on his way home from The Hole in the Wall pub at the time.

The men made unsuccessful attempts to steal a bag from the victim, who suffered serious facial injuries during the incident that required hospital treatment.

The only descriptions we have of the suspects at this time are that they are all believed to be aged in their 20s, one was wearing a cream coat with a zip and the hood up, another was wearing a grey coat with a hoody, and another had a scarf on him.

Did you see a group of people matching this description in the area around this time?

Officers will be increasing patrols in this area of the city and would like to speak with anyone who can assist enquiries.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44190441903.

Alternatively you can contact the charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
