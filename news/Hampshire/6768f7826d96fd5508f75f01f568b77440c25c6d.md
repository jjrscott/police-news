Officers, who were executing a warrant at a property in Hedge End, have arrested a man for drug offences.

They attended an address Radley Close just after midday on Wednesday 21 October. An occupant of the property was found to be in possession of cannabis.

As a result, a 46-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession of a controlled Class B drug.

A 41-year-old woman was also searched and found to be in possession of a suspected Class A drug and was reported for summons.

They were both later released under investigation, pending further enquiries.
