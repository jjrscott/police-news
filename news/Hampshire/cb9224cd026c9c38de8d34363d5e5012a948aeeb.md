We are now in a position to confirm the identity of a woman whose body was found on a rooftop in Palmerston Road, Southsea.

Officers were called to the location after the body of 40-year-old Lorraine Bream, of Marmion Road in Southsea, was discovered at 10.50am on Monday 16 September.

Police are now asking anyone who saw Lorraine in the Palmerston Road area any time after 8pm on Sunday 15 September to get in touch, as this information may be crucial to our investigation into the circumstances surrounding her death.

As part of this investigation, a 53-year-old man from Southsea was arrested on suspicion of murder and has been released on police bail pending further enquiries until 14 October.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44190330369.
