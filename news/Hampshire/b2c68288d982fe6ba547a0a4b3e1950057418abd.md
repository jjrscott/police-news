Officers executed simultaneous warrants in London and Brighton on 2 July as part of an operation to tackle county lines drug dealing.

Operation Monument is Hampshire Constabulary's local response to a joint operation, Op Orochi, led by the Metropolitan Police, into county lines dealing.

The warrants were executed to locate and arrest a suspected line holder for a network active in Andover.

Alexander Derek Thomas Parsons, 24, of Arlington Road in Camden, was arrested and has been charged with being concerned in the supply of crack cocaine and heroin, and possession with intent to supply.

He has been remanded in custody and is due to appear before Southampton Crown Court on 31 July.

Operation Orochi is the biggest County Lines operation police have ever delivered. The focus is dismantling lines from the centre by targeting the line-holders who aren't hands-on with the commodity and avoid police contact, but exploit others to run drugs across the UK.
