Shops and pubs in Romsey passed a recent test purchase operation in Romsey.

Staff at ten licensed premises challenged two 16-year-old volunteers when they tried to buy alcoholic drinks.

When the volunteers couldn't produce the appropriate ID, the premises refused the sale.

The operation took place on Wednesday 10 July.

Colin Pollard, licensing officer at Hampshire Constabulary, said: "The 100 per cent pass rate in Romsey is a very positive result and highlights the robust age verification policies being implemented by the management and staff of these premises.

"We carry out these checks to make sure venues have the right training and processes in place.

"Operations like this one reduce the risk of young people being involved in anti-social behaviour, or becoming a victim of crime, or being taken to hospital for medical treatment."
