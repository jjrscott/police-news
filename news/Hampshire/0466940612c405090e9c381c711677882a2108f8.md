Officers in Gosport have made 9 arrests today (Tuesday 16 July) as part of an investigation to tackle the supply of class A drugs.

Warrants were conducted at addresses in Stoners Close, Sunbeam Way and Pavilion Way, where arrests were made, and a further arrest was made in Forton Park.

Three women and five men from Gosport, aged between 22 and 55 years, and a 32-year-old man from Liverpool were arrested on suspicion of drug offences.

All remain in custody at this time.

Chief Inspector Mark Lewis said: "This was a great piece of work which saw officers from across the Force, including Neighbourhoods, Investigations and Public Order trained officers, join together to target addresses linked to class A drug dealing.

"We've made a significant number of arrests today, which we hope reassures the people living in these areas that we take the supply of drugs extremely seriously."

Anyone with information about drug supply is encouraged to make contact with the Gosport Neighbourhood Policing team on 101. If you have any concerns, feel free to email us at Gosporteast@hampshire.pnn.police.uk
