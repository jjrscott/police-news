We are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted in Claythorpe Road, Basingstoke, on Friday evening (April 3).

Police were called around 8.20pm to a report of a 21-year-old man having been assaulted.

He suffered injuries to his left arm and chin and was taken to hospital.

Officers investigating the incident are keen to speak with anyone who may have information that could assist them.

They are particularly keen to speak with anyone who saw a group of four to five men, who were wearing hooded tops, in the Claythorpe Road and St Michael's Road area on Friday night.

Maybe you saw a group, or have CCTV outside your home or a dash cam in your car that captured footage of a number of men in the area?

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200120168. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
