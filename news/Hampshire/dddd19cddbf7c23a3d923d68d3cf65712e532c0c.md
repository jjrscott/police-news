We are appealing for information after a white Transit van failed to stop following a collision in Southampton last week.

Police were called just before 5.45pm on Thursday 17 September, following a collision involving the mark 6 Ford Transit van and a motorcycle on Bitterne Road East.

The van, a 2002-plate, failed to stop at the scene. It is believed it will have sustained damage to its nearside headlamp and will be missing the nearside fog lamp as a result of the collision.

The rider of the motorcycle, a 64-year-old man, was taken to hospital following the collision, where he remains at this time.

Officers investigating the exact circumstances of the collision are keen to speak with anyone who can help them locate the Ford Transit van.

We also want to urge the drive of the vehicle to make contact with us as soon as possible.

Anyone with information should call 101, quoting 44200361043.
