Officers investigating thefts from businesses in Southsea have charged a man.

David William Knipe, 40, of Fratton Way, Southsea, has been charged with theft from a shop, possession of a controlled drug of Class B and criminal damage.

The charges come after we were called to incidents at Co-op, Winter Road, and Wilko, Arundel Street, on August 3 and 4 respectively.

He was remanded in custody to appear at Portsmouth Magistrates' Court today (August 5).

The investigation forms part of Operation Monster, in which we are working in partnership to tackle the impact and harm of thefts on local businesses.
