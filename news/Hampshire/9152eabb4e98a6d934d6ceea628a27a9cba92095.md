We know the face is covered but we are hoping to identify the man pictured in this Efit image.

We would like to speak to him in connection with an attempted burglary in Drayton.

The incident took place at 7.24pm on 11 December at a property in Havant Road, Drayton.

A woman disturbed a group of people who had attempted to force entry into the rear of her house.

She then challenged the men outside her house after they made their way to the front of the property.

It was reported that one of the men struck the front door with an object described as a crow bar.

The group did not gain entry to the house and nothing was reported stolen.

We would like to hear from anyone who witnessed this incident, or saw a group of men loitering and a dark-coloured Audi parked in the area.

We are also keen to speak to anyone who thinks they might recognise the man in the image.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44190445761.
