A 27-year-old man from London has been charged with two separate offences of being concerned in the supply of heroin and crack cocaine.

Guled Hurreh, of Hilltop Avenue, Wembley was arrested in the early hours of Wednesday morning in London as part of joint partnership work and collaboration with Hampshire, Norfolk and the Metropolitan Police.

His arrest was made as part of a proactive drugs investigation into a suspected county line being run between London, Norwich and Portsmouth.

He appeared before Portsmouth Magistrates Court yesterday (10 March) and was remanded.

He is next due to appear at Portsmouth Crown Court on 12 April for a pre-trial public hearing.
