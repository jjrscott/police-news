We are appealing for witnesses following a single-vehicle collision in Owslebury.

Officers were called to Longwood Road just before 00.30am today (December 17) after a white Vauxhall Insignia collided with a tree.

The driver of the vehicle, a 29-year-old man from Totton, was pronounced dead at the scene.

We are keen to speak with anyone who have been in Owslebury at this time and driving on Longwood Road, or who saw a white Vauxhall Insignia in the area.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44190452045. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
