We're appealing for information after a woman was sexually assaulted in Blackfield yesterday, Saturday, January 2.

The 31-year-old had sat down on a fallen tree trunk while out walking in woodland off Row Down, between Roughdown Lane and Kings Copse Road sometime between 11.20am and 11.50am. She had planned to eat her lunch she had just bought.

A few minutes later a man came and sat next to her and made an indecent suggestion. She told him to go away and he then attacked her.

The victim managed to fight him off and the man made off. She called police and stopped some people nearby for some help. It is believed that there were a lot of dog walkers and other people walking in the area at that time.

The attacker is described as: white aged in his later 20s to early 30s, approximately 5'8" - 5'9" tall, medium build, pale skin, wearing a dark coloured beanie style hat, dark top, blue jeans, trainers and a dark coloured fabric mask. Following the attack he may have an injury to his eye and scratches to his face.

We're asking for anyone who thinks they saw the man in the area around that time or has any information about the incident to contact us on 101 and ask to speak to Western CID quoting 44210001443.
