Officers investigating an indecent exposure incident in Southampton have made an arrest.

The incident happened at around 3.40pm on Thursday, 18 March at Trinity Road car park, situated between St. Mary's Road and St. Andrew's Road.

A woman was walking through the underpass below St. Andrew's Road when she saw a man exposing himself. The man then followed her towards her car and attempted to gain access to her vehicle, but she managed to drive away.

A 12-year-old boy from Southampton has been arrested on suspicion of indecent exposure and a public order offence.

He has also been arrested on suspicion of a further three sexual assault offences and two indecent exposure offences relating to separate incidents.

He has been questioned by officers and released on police bail, with conditions, while our enquiries continue.

Officers continue to appeal to anyone who may have witnessed something, but hasn't yet spoken to us, to get in touch by calling 101 quoting 44210101866.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or report via their website.
