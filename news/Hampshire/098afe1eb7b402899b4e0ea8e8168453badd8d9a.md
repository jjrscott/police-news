We're appealing for witnesses after a motorcyclist was seriously injured in an crash on Hospital Hill in Aldershot.

It's not known exactly how the 40-year-old came off his blue and white Suzuki bike yet but it left him with serious injuries.

It happened about 6.50pm. It's believed the bike was driving past a line of traffic at the time by the traffic lights at the junction with Pennefathers Road.

We're now asking for anyone who saw what happened or has dash cam footage of the incident to contact Sgt Phil Eastick on 101.
