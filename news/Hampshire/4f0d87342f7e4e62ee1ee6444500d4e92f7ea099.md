We're appealing for witnesses after a cyclist was left with serious injuries in Fordingbridge.

Officers were called following reports of the injured cyclist on Bridge Street, just before 1.30pm o Thursday, April 9.

We attended the scene and found the cyclist in the road, outside of The Dolls House shop.

The 43-year-old man suffered serious injuries and is being treated at Salisbury Hospital.

Investigations into the exact circumstances of what happened to cause the cyclist to come off his bike are ongoing and officers are keen to speak to anyone who may have been in the area and seen something.

If you think you can help, please call 101, quoting 44200126618.
