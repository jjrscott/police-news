We are delighted to say that missing goats Lulu and Dolly have been found safe and well.

The friendly nanny goats, who are mother and daughter, were stolen along with another seven goats overnight between 5.35pm on May 18 and 8am on May 19 from the barn premises in Lee, near Romsey, in the Test Valley area.

Seven of the goats were later recovered after being found wandering in the road in Nursling but the two females remained missing.

We are happy to report that Lulu and Dolly were found by a member of the public trotting, ironically, along Trotts Lane in Marchwood on Friday, May 29.

Police Staff Investigator Melody Manning said: "The owner was so delighted to be reunited with Lulu and Dolly. They are affectionate and friendly animals and were very much valued and missed by all.

"We don't know yet where they were being held and by whom so we are still appealing for anyone who has any information about this crime to please get in touch. These much loved animals were stolen after the barn was broken into and Lulu and Dolly were held for ten days - so we are still very keen to find those responsible."

If you have any information, please call 101 and quote reference 44200177169.

Alternatively, ring Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
