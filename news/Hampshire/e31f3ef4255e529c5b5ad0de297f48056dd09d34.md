We are appealing for witnesses after a 62-year-old man died following a serious collision in Ventnor.

We were called to the collision at 8.47pm last night, 1 July, at the junction of Southford Lane and Newport Road.

The man was riding a green Kawasaki motorcycle when it was in collision with a yellow Volkswagen Transporter.

Despite the best efforts of the ambulance crew, he was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

His next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers.

The passenger of the motorcycle, a 58-year-old woman, has been taken to Southampton General Hospital with life-threatening injuries.

We are investigating the exact circumstances of the collision and are keen to speak to anyone with information.

Were you in the area at the time? Perhaps you saw either vehicle in the run up to the collision?

It is possible the rider and passenger were at the biker's event on Military Road before the collision.

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 and quote the reference 44200241182.
