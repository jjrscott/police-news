Officers carried out a joint operation in North East Hampshire as part of a concerted effect to disrupt rural crime.

More than 30 officers from Hampshire, Thames Valley and Surrey took part in the cross border operation on the night of Thursday 6 February.

The work was part of Hampshire Constabulary's Operation Rebate, which was set up to tackle crimes such as burglaries and thefts from motor vehicles.

Teams from Hampshire Constabulary included the Neighbourhood Policing Teams at Yateley and Tadley, the Dog Unit and the Roads Policing Unit.

During the operation, officers carried out 20 checks on vehicles in the area.

Two people were arrested on suspicion of drink-driving and one person was arrested on suspicion of a drug-driving offence.

A man was also arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply a drug of Class A following a stop in Fleet.

Sergeant Martyn Evans said: "The aim of this ongoing operation is to disrupt those criminals who travel often cross-border to commit crimes in rural areas.

"I'm pleased to report that there were no reported break-ins during our operation.

"We will continue to work with our neighbouring forces to show criminals that rural areas in Hampshire are not a soft target."
