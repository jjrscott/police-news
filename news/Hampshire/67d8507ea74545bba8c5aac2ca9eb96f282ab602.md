We're appealing for witnesses following a robbery at the Esso Petrol Station in Northam.

The incident happened at around 9.20am on Saturday 7 December.

A man entered the store , grabbed a glass bottle from a shelf and smashed it. He then threatened a member of staff with the broken bottle and made demands for the till to be opened. The member of staff received a cut to their hand from the broken glass before opening the till.

The man stole money from the till and ran from the store.

The man is described as being white, aged between 18 and 25 years old, 6 feet tall and of proportionate build.
