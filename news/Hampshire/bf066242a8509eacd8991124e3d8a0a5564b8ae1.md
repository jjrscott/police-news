We are appealing for witnesses and dash cam footage after a 23-year-old man was seriously assaulted on Bursledon Road on Saturday 31 August.

The incident happened between 3.30pm and 4pm.

The man was walking his bike on the pavement on Bursledon Road, near where it joins Maybray King Way by the Mazda garage when he was approached by a group of men who assaulted him.

He suffered a fractured jaw as a result.

One of the men has been described as white, aged between 35 and 40-years-old, 6 feet 2 inches tall and with a stocky build. He was wearing jeans, a shirt and black shoes.

The group reportedly ran off towards Bath Road after the incident.

This assault happened on a busy stretch of road on a Saturday afternoon. We would like to appeal to anyone who was driving past at this time who saw this incident occur or who has a dash cam.

Please call 101 and quote 44190310598.
