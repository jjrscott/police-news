We are appealing for witnesses after a 19-year-old man was hit over the head with a vodka bottle in an unprovoked attack.

The incident occurred in Blackwater, near the Shell garage, between midnight and 1.30am last Sunday (January 12).

The victim was walking on the A30 London Road between Blackwater Train Station and Reading Road Roundabout.

A dark coloured car, possibly a VW Golf, approached the victim and two men, who the victim did not recognise, got out and chased him.

He was then punched and struck on the head several times with a vodka bottle before they made off.

The victim went to hospital where he was diagnosed with concussion, as well as bruising and swelling to his head.

Were you in the area on this night and saw anything suspicious? Perhaps you have a dash cam in your car and captured footage of the assault or the Golf?

Officers investigating the assault are also keen to speak with the driver of a white Ford Focus, which was parked on the garage forecourt at the time. It is believed he may have witnessed the incident and could have important evidence.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200013544. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
