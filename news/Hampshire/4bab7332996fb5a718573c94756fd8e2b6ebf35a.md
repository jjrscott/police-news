We are appealing for witnesses and information following an assault on Hayling Island on Wednesday 18 November.

At around 11.05pm on Beach Road, near the junction with the seafront, a group of five men assaulted a 31-year-old man, causing cuts, bruises and swelling to his face.

We would like to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time and saw or heard anything.

We are also seeking dash cam footage from anyone who was on the seafront at the time who may have captured a silver Mercedes saloon.

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44200447511.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
