Police are warning residents in Basingstoke to remain vigilant about doorstep fraud and scams.

Neighbourhood Sergeant Trevor Taylor said: "We are asking residents, particularly elderly or vulnerable people, to be aware and report to us if you have been approached at your door in a way that made you uncomfortable or suspicious.

"The person calling may say they are a person in authority, such as a police officer, council or health worker but not everyone is who they say they are.

"The advice to residents is to use a door chain or bar when opening the door or don't open the door at all if you're not expecting someone to call round. If in doubt, keep them out!

"If they are from a legitimate authority or charity, they won't mind making an appointment and coming back another time. We are supposed to be social distancing during this period so anyone coming to your door should remain no less than two metres away and should not attempt to enter your home."

"If you have experienced something that seems suspicious, call 999 in an emergency and 101 if it is urgent. If you have any information about this crime, please call 101 and quote reference 44200116782."

If you need to report something that is not urgent, please do so by going online via our website www.hampshire.police.uk or you can contact your Neighbourhood team by emailing:

Basingstoke.Town.Police@hampshire.pnn.police.uk

Or

Basingstoke.Rural.Police@hampshire.pnn.police.uk

There is additional information and updates regarding fraud on the Action Fraud website.

A 46 year old woman from Basingstoke has been arrested on suspicion of burglary following an incident at 11.30pm on March 31, where a 71 year old woman had her handbag stolen from her home. The woman has been bailed with conditions while enquiries continue.
