## Jo Sheen

Officers have made three arrests today (Nov 2) in relation to the Joanne Sheen missing person investigation.

Jo Sheen was reported missing by her family on 22 February this year after they had not heard from her for several months.

The last known corroborated sighting we have of Jo is on Thursday 5 December 2019 when she travelled from Fareham, back to Southampton, with a friend.

We have been appealing for information since April as to her whereabouts.

However today we have made three arrests, and we are now treating this as a murder investigation.

Joanne is still missing and her body has not been recovered.

Officers from Hampshire Constabulary's Major Crime Team have arrested three people:

• A 50-year-old man from Southampton has been arrested on conspiracy to murder
• A 63-year-old man from Southampton has been arrested on conspiracy to murder
• A 29-year-old man from Basingstoke has been arrested on conspiracy to murder

All three remain in police custody at this time.

We continue to appeal for information in relation to this case.

If anyone has any information that may assist us with this investigation, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting Operation Blackboard or 44200068330.

Alternatively people can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
