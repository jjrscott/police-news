A dispersal order has been put in place in the Azalea Park/Peter Driver Sports Ground areas of Church Crookham over the coming weekend.

Neighbourhood Inspector Jennifer Lovegrove authorised the order on behalf of Hampshire Constabulary. It will specifically cover the area between Sandy Lane, Beacon Hill Road and Aldershot Road. It will run from 5pm on Friday, August 28 to 5pm on Sunday, August 30.

If it's considered appropriate, a further dispersal order could then be put in place.

The order is in response to ongoing reports of groups congregating and anti social behaviour.

The Section 34 dispersal order gives officers the power to disperse groups of people out of the areas as shown within the red boundary on the map.

Inspector Lovegrove said: "We are fully aware of reports of anti social behaviour in this area and we will be conducting high visibility patrols in these areas to reassure the public and deal with any issues."

Anyone who witnesses anti-social behaviour or large gatherings is encouraged to call 101, or if a crime or incident is in progress, always call 999.
