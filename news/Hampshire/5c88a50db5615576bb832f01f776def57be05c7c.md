Tribute has been paid to a grandfather who was found dead in Southampton earlier this week.

John Perry, 70, was found dead at an address in Bursledon Road, on the evening of February 5.

Today his family have paid tribute to him.

They said: "It saddens us to announce the untimely death of our beloved dad, John Perry.

"John lived a vibrant life, full of adventure and laughter, always doing his
best to support the people that mattered most to him.

"John was a father, brother, grandfather and raver. His enthusiasm for love
and life, contagious hilarious personality and terrible dad jokes, always
brought smiles to the faces of his family and friends. That's why we loved him
and we should continue to share memories of John with smiles on our faces.

"Although none of us had a real chance to say goodbye, he would want us to
celebrate his colourful life in style. John, Dad, we love you. May you
forever rest in peace."

A 28-year-old man, arrested on suspicion of murder, remains in custody at this time.
