Officers investigating a robbery at a Whiteley store are appealing for witnesses.

It happened between 6am and 6.30am this morning, 30 November, at the Co-Op store on Yew Tree Drive, Whiteley.

Two men wearing face coverings entered the store armed with crowbars that they used to threaten staff.

They stole cigarettes, alcohol, cash, and technical equipment from the staff-room. A staff member, a 35-year-old woman, was assaulted during the incident but was not injured.

Both men are described as being white, and wearing hooded tops, jogging bottoms, and trainers. They both also wore face masks covering most of their faces.

The two men have left in a dark-coloured saloon car.

Were you in the area at the time? Perhaps you saw a dark-coloured car driving around the Yew Tree Drive area between 5.40am and 6.30am?

Officers are keen to speak to anyone with information, or dash-cam footage, that could help their investigation.

Please phone 101 with reference 44200462425. Alternatively, you can phone Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
