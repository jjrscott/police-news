Do you recognise this man?

We would like to identify and speak to him in connection with an assault that happened at a Wilko store in Southampton.

The incident took place at 11.28am on Monday 11 May, outside the Wilko store on Harbour Parade after a man left the store with hair products, without making payment.

A member of staff challenged the man outside the store.

The man then threatened to stab the member of staff with a knife and needles before trying to bite and spit at him. The man then made off on a push bike.

No weapon was seen and no contact was made during the incident.

The man is described as being white, 6 feet 2 inches tall, slim build with long brown hair and a beard, wearing a blue quilted jacket, green sweat pants, black trainers and had a blue and white push bike.

We know the CCTV image isn't clear but if you recognise this man or have any information that could assist us with our investigation please call 101 quoting 44200166316.

Alternatively you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org
