A teenager from Eastleigh has been charged with terrorism offences this evening (17/6) by detectives from Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE).

The 14-year-old boy who cannot be named because of his age, has been charged with one count of preparation of terrorist acts contrary to contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006 connected to Islamist terrorism.

The boy was initially arrested by officers from Hampshire Constabulary on Friday 12 June and subsequently further arrested under section 41 of the Terrorism Act, by detectives from CTPSE.

He is due to appear before Westminster Magistrates Court tomorrow (18/6).

We know that the community of Eastleigh might be concerned about this news, however we have been working closely with colleagues in Counter Terrorism Policing South East on this investigation and we want to reassure you that we believe the investigation is isolated, and with no known wider risk to the community.
