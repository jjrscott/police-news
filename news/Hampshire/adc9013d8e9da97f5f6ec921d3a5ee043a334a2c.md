We're appealing for information and witnesses after the front door of a house was set on fire in Southampton.

Officers were called to the incident which occurred between 1.30am and 1.45am on Monday, 20 April.

The victims, a 56-year-old man and a 44-year-old woman, were at home in the property in Wimpson Lane, Southampton at the time of the incident.

A passer-by saw the fire and alerted the occupants.

The 56-year-old man climbed out of the living room window and managed to extinguish most of the fire before calling the fire service.

A petrol can was also found on fire at the front of the address.

The 56-year-old man was taken to Southampton General Hospital and treated for smoke inhalation. He has since been discharged.

Officers investigating the incident are particularly keen to hear from anyone in the area who might have sold a green petrol can in the last couple of days.

Anyone who witnessed anything suspicious in the area at this time or has any information is asked to call us on 101, quoting reference 44200138555.

Alternatively people can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
