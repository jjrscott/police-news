Basingstoke Neighbourhood Policing Team want to ring the changes for thieves who target shoppers over the forthcoming festive period in the town's shops and supermarkets.

They will be offering shoppers free bells to attach to purses and bags. If anyone tries to steal a purse, the bell will jingle to alert the owner and anyone around them.

Officers and Town Centre BID Rangers will be handing them out to shoppers in and around the town centre.

They will also be at a stand in Festival Place on Friday, October 25 between 9am and 12pm and on Saturday, November 2, from 11am to 2pm. Come and say hello!

The bells will also be available for collection from the Customer Lounge at Festival Place shopping centre.

Neighbourhood Sergeant Trevor Taylor said: "We have experienced a number of incidents where thieves are targeting shoppers.

"We want to firstly ask you to be aware of what's happening around you when you are out shopping or in the street generally.

"Keep your bag closed and secure and carry it in front of you or across your chest or conceal your wallet in a buttoned or zipped up jacket. Never leave a handbag or any personal possessions in a trolley or hanging off the back of a pushchair or chair if you stop for a coffee.

"Don't give thieves an early Christmas present!"

Two females, a 31 year old and a 33 year old from Croydon, have been arrested on suspicion of theft of a purse from a handbag at Asda in Brighton Way, Basingstoke, on September 24. They remain under investigation.
