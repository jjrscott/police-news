We're appealing for witnesses following a fatal collision on the M27 this morning.

Officers were called at around 4.20am today (April 10) to reports of a collision involving a pedestrian and a lorry on the M27.

This happened between junction3 and junction 2 of the westbound carriageway,

The 40-year-old female pedestrian was pronounced dead at the scene.

Her next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers.

The lorry driver was uninjured.

Investigations into the exact circumstances of the collision are ongoing at this time, however the M27 has been fully reopened.

We are keen to speak to any motorists who were driving along this stretch of the M27 at around the time of the incident and may have seen anything or has dash cam footage.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call us on 101, quoting 44200127453.
