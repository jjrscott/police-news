A 36 year old Farnborough man has been sentenced to 18 weeks in prison after admitting shoplifting goods worth £152.20 from the same store.

Brett Worger, of Totland Close, pleaded guilty to shoplifting from the BP Express in Prospect Road on four separate occasions.

Basingstoke Magistrates Court heard Worger walked into the store at 7.50pm on October 4. He picked up BBQ chicken kebabs, Chicken and Chorizo kebabs and a bottle of red wine and started eating and drinking the goods (worth £10.20) while he was still in store.

Police were called and Worger was still tucking in when officers arrived.

He further pleaded guilty to three other offences of shoplifting at the same BP Express:

* On October 10, taking three chicken drumsticks and a curry.
* On September 30, stealing three bottles of red wine and a Chicken Tikka.
* On September 9, stealing pizza, curry and pies

Worger also admitted four breaches of a restraining order.
