Officers investigating a fatal collision in Basingstoke last week are keen to locate the driver of a dark red or maroon van who witnessed the incident.

Enquiries into the exact circumstances of the collision are ongoing.

It is believed a dark red or maroon van was directly behind the Vauxhall Vectra at the time of the collision on Popley Way just before 6.30pm last Thursday (January 2).

We believe the driver of the van could provide important information in relation to this incident and officers are keen to speak with the driver.

Do you drive a red or maroon van and were you on Popley Way on this day? Maybe a friend or family member drives one?

Anyone with information should contact us on 101, quoting 44200002157. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
