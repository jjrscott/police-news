We are appealing for a group of witnesses that may be able to assist our investigation into a rape.

The rape was reported to police on 8 September, however it took place between 9pm and 11pm on 31 August in Stratton Park, Basingstoke.

It's been reported to police that the victim, a teenage girl, had been in the park with a group of teenage boys prior to the assault.

We would ask this group, and any other witnesses, to come forward and talk to police as any information you have may prove vital to the investigation.

Detective Sergeant Tim Judd said: "We've been told that this incident took place in an area of the park not far from the tennis courts and the scout hut.

"At this time, the only description we have of the person responsible is a man with a beard who spoke with a local accent.

"Officers are making enquiries in the local area and further visits to the park will be conducted this weekend.

"If you have any concerns and see police officers out and about, please don't hesitate to approach them."

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44190319721.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
