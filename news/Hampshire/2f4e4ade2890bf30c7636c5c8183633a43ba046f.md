A burglar who snuck into a house in Southampton while the homeowners slept upstairs has been jailed for three and a half years.

Jason Williams, 38, of no fixed address, climbed into the property on Millbrook Road East through a ground floor window in the early hours of 4 September 2018.

Whilst inside, he stole a mobile phone and cash from a handbag before heading to the dining room area where he stole a digital camera.

PC Charlie Buckingham, from the Western Op Hawk team, said: "This was a brazen invasion of a house, which understandably left the occupants feeling anxious in their own home when they awoke the next morning to find they had been burgled.

"Williams' DNA was recovered from the scene, which proved crucial to identifying him as a suspect. He was arrested by officers at a later date in a car park in Southampton.

"We would encourage anyone affected by burglary to report this to us, so we can continue to target and bring to justice those who commit this type of offence."

Williams was found guilty of burglary on 23 July at Southampton Crown Court, following trial by jury. He was sentenced the same day to three years six months.
