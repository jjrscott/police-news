We are appealing for witnesses after a 90-year-old woman died following a serious collision in Petersfield.

We were called to the collision at 2.32pm yesterday, 23 July, at the junction of Durford Road and Heath Road East.

The collision was between a black Vauxhall Corsa and a silver Vauxhall Astra, causing the Astra, of which the 90-year-old woman was a passenger, to overturn.

Despite the best efforts of the ambulance crew, she was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

The driver of the Astra, an 88-year-old man from Petersfield, has been taken to hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries.

We are investigating the exact circumstances of the collision and are keen to speak to anyone with information.

Did you see the collision? Perhaps you have dash-cam footage showing the moments leading up to the collision?

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101, quoting the reference 44200275376.
