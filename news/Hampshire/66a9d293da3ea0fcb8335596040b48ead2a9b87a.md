We are appealing for witnesses who may have seen something suspicious, or suspicious vehicles, following a burglary in Farnborough.

The burglary took place between 7.30pm and 8.15pm on Thursday 12 September at a house in The Crescent.

A large quantity of jewellery estimated to be worth thousands of pounds was stolen.

Officers are asking anyone who was in this area, and in the Rectory Road area near the Carlyon Close junction during this time, who may have noticed any suspicious people or vehicles, to contact police.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44190326008.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.

If you have high value jewellery, please consider the following advice:

• If you have a quantity of valuable jewellery in your property, consider storing in another safe location such as a safety deposit box facility.

• Avoid posting about weddings, festivals or other celebrations on social media - criminals may see your posts and work out when you won't be at home.

• During festivals, please take extra care while out and about. Avoid wearing large amounts of jewellery in a public place and try to avoid travelling or walking alone.

• Check your privacy settings to ensure only friends and family can see your posts and photos.

• Photograph each valuable piece of gold or jewellery and keep a written description - this will help police trace it back to you if it is ever stolen and will help identify it if attempts are made to sell it on.

• Ensure jewellery is adequately insured. Register all property (not just jewellery) for free on www.immobilise.com.

• Other security measures include installing CCTV and an alarm and security lighting with motion sensors. For more information about crime prevention, visit www.hampshire.police.uk.
