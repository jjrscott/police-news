Officers attended an address in Roberts Road, Southampton, yesterday (Monday 22 February) and arrested two people on suspicion of drugs offences after locating a quantity of suspected Class A drugs.

A 36-year-old man from London was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs.

A 24-year-old woman, of no fixed abode, was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs and possession of Class B drugs.

Both were questioned by officers and released on bail with conditions.

These arrests follow a previous arrest at the same address over the weekend.

On Saturday, 20 February, officers attended the same address on Roberts Road and arrested a 17-year-old boy, from Leeds, on suspicion of false imprisonment and possession with intent to supply Class A drugs. He was questioned by officers and released from custody, but remains under investigation.

Officers who attended the scene yesterday (22 February) spoke to residents to reassure them about our ongoing work in relation to these incidents.

Police Sergeant Allan Dineley said "These arrests form part of Operation Fortress, Hampshire Constabulary's ongoing campaign to reduce drug related harm.

"Drug supply can often be linked to a variety of other crimes, such as theft, burglary, robbery and serious violence, which is why it is so vital we identify the root of the issue.

"I'd like to reassure residents that we are doing all we can to tackle drugs supply in Southampton and keep our communities safe.

"If you suspect drug dealing, drug-related activity or associated crime in your area, then please call 101.

"Alternatively people can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

"All information could help us catch and convict those who deal drugs to our communities and even the smallest pieces of information can help us develop a clearer intelligence picture."
