We are appealing for witnesses following a burglary that took place in New Milton on Monday 15 March.

Between 8.30 and 9.30pm, two men entered an address on Manor Road and stole cash from the property.

The occupants were at home at the time but were not injured.

We would like to speak to the two men pictured, who were seen in the area at the time, in connection with the incident.

We appreciate that the images are not the best quality, but they are the best we have available at this time.

The first man is described as:

 * Aged between 20 and 30-years-old
 * Between 5foot and 8inches and 6foot tall
 * Of proportionate build
 * Wearing a light coloured top and dark bottoms, a black beanie style hat and a face mask.

The second man is described as:

 * Aged between 20 and 30-years-old
 * Between 5foot and 8inches and 6foot tall
 * Of proportionate build
 * Wearing overalls, a dark coloured hat and a face mask.
