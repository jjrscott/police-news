A man has been sentenced to two years and six months in prison after being found guilty of several non-recent sex offences in Cowplain following a trial at Portsmouth Crown Court.

Simon Shaw, 46, of St John Street in Wells, Somerset, was found guilty on Friday 8 January of four counts of engaging in non-penetrative sexual activity with a child.

The court heard that Shaw began abusing his victim in 2011, with his final offence occurring in 2012.

His offences were reported to the police by the victim in 2017.

He was sentenced on Monday 8 March, after previously denying all charges against him.

Detective Sergeant Shaun Goddard from Hampshire Constabulary's Eastern Criminal Investigation Department said: "Understandably this was a very traumatic ordeal for the victim and I would like to commend her on her bravery and courage, which has helped secure this guilty verdict.

"We encourage anyone who has been the victim of a sexual offence, no matter when it happened, to contact us on 101 and speak with an officer in confidence."
