We are appealing to identify the man in this image after it was reported a 15-year-old girl was sexually assaulted over the top of her clothing in Bitterne in August.

The girl was waiting at the bus stop on Bitterne Road West near to Bitterne railway station at around 12.55pm on Sunday 9 August when it was reported a man approached her and touched her inappropriately over the top of her clothing.

When the No.18 Blue Star Bus arrived, both the man and the girl got on the bus where it was reported the man sat opposite her and tried to communicate with her.

The incident was later reported to police by the girl's mother.

We previously appealed for witnesses in this case, and now we have a CCTV image we'd like to release.

The man has been described as white, aged between 30 and 40-years-old with short black hair and stubble. He was said to be wearing a green short sleeved shirt, jeans & a grey bum bag.

Do you recognise this man? If so, please contact us on 101 number quoting crime ref 44200301639.
