Do you recognise the man in this E-Fit?

We are looking to speak with him in connection to a burglary at an address on Spring Cross Avenue, Blackwater, on Friday 4 December.

The victim returned home at around 5.40pm to see three people running from her address and make off in a dark coloured saloon vehicle.

Jewelry and cash were stolen during the burglary.

The man we want to identify is described as being white, between 20 and 25-years-old, of a slim/lean build, with brown hair. He is also described as having prominent and chiseled cheekbones.

We are keen to hear from anyone with information that may assist our investigation.

Do you recognise the man in this image? Perhaps you saw a suspicious vehicle on Spring Close Avenue that day?

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 with the reference 44200469042.
