We are appealing for witnesses to after a collision between a bus and a pedestrian left a man in hospital with serious injuries.

The incident happened on Castle Way, near to Bargate Street, in Southampton at around 12pm yesterday, 25 August.

The 78-year-old pedestrian was taken to Southampton General Hospital with serious and possibly life-changing injuries.

Officers investigating the collision are keen to speak with anyone who might be able to assist their enquiries.

Were you in the area at the time? Or perhaps you have dash cam footage showing the moments leading up to the collision?

Anyone with information should call 101, quoting 44200326531.
