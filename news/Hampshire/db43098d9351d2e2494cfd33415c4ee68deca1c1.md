Officers, who were executing a warrant at a property in the New Forest have seized a quantity of drugs as a result.

Specialist officers from across the district, including members of the Eastleigh neighbourhood policing team, attended an address on Chapel Lane in Lyndhurst just after 8am this morning (22 December). A quantity of drugs were seized along with other items associated with drug-related activity, as well as a number of tools.

A 25-year-old man from Lyndhurst was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply and conspiracy to commit a burglary.

He remains in custody at this time.
