We're appealing for witnesses following a robbery in Lordshill, Southampton.

At around 11.20am on Monday 21 December, a woman in her 30s was stood at the bus stop on the junction of Aldermoor Road and Myrtle Road on her way to do some Christmas shopping.

At this time she was approached by a man on a mountain bike.

The cyclist pushed the victim over with his foot before grabbing her handbag and cycling off down Aldermoor Road, in the direction of the shops at the top of the hill.

He was described as a white man, quite skinny, wearing white Nike trainers, a black tracksuit with the hood up and a black face covering. The tracksuit was described as looking too big for him.

The bike was a silver mountain bike with suspension on the front and back and it had a Fox logo on the frame of the bike.

We're appealing for anyone who saw this man in the area, or perhaps drove through the area and has Dash Cam that may have captured him.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44200490778.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org
