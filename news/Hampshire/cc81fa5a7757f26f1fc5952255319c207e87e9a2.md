We can now confirm the identity of a man who sadly died in a motorcycle crash on the Isle of Wight on Sunday 8 November.

Sadly, Christopher David Schuchart, 35, of Yarborough Road, East Cowes, died of his injuries at St Mary's hospital.

Paying tribute to him, his family said: "Christopher Schuchart, 35, was a sociable, hardworking, fun loving and helpful man who will be sadly missed by his Wife and children.

"He was always on the go whether it be out fishing with his friends or out on his motorbike which he cherished. He was always willing to help anyone with anything they needed and will be sadly missed by so many."

We are continuing to make enquiries as to the exact circumstances of the collision.
