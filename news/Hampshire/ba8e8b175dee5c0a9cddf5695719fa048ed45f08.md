Police officers carrying out a routine stop check on a vehicle, which showed to have no insurance, have arrested two women in connection with drug offences.

The incident occurred in the early hours of this morning (26 February) when officers conducted a moving vehicle check on a black Vauxhall which was travelling along Eling Lane. The vehicle was shown to have no insurance and was followed to a nearby petrol station.

Officers spoke to the two occupants of the vehicle and a search was conducted - whereby a quantity of Class A drugs, drug-related paraphernalia and a quantity of cash were located. These items were seized, along with the car for having no insurance.

A 39-year-old woman from Dibden was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs and possession of a bladed article in a public place.

A 34-year-old woman from Dibden was also arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs and possession of a sharp pointed article in a public place.

Both remain in custody at this time, while police enquiries continue.
