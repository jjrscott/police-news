We are appealing for witnesses after a number of air pistols were stolen in a burglary in Petersfield.

The incident happened at The Stock Exchange, Chapel Street, overnight between Monday 8 February and Tuesday 9 February.

Entry was forced to the store causing significant damage, and a number of air pistols and accessories were stolen.

Officers investigating are keen to speak with anyone who may have information that could assist their enquiries.

Did you see anything or anyone suspicious in the Chapel Street area between the relevant times? Perhaps you have seen an air pistol for sale?

DC Chris Phillips, the investigating officer, said: "We want to reassure the community that none of the weapons stolen are live firing weapons, and are all air pistols.

"If seen in public though, it would be difficult to see any difference to a live weapon.

"We ask that anyone reports anything suspicious, or any possible sighting of a firearm, whether viable or not, to the police. Please do not approach anyone you see if you suspect them to be carrying a weapon."

Anyone with information can phone 101 with the reference 44210049196. Alternatively, you can phone Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
