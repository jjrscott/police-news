Southampton police officers set up a dispersal order last night to target anti-social behaviour in the city centre.

The order was in response to a report of an assault on a man by a group of youths in the St Mary's Street area shortly after 9pm yesterday, Thursday 23 April.

The man received facial injuries and was taken to Southampton General Hospital for treatment.

The dispersal order was in place between 9.35pm yesterday (23 April) and 9.35am today (24 April) and covered the area of St Mary's Street, Golden Grove, Kingsland Estate and Hoglands Park.

The order gives officers the power to disperse people involved in anti-social behaviour out of the town centre area.

Those under 16 will be taken be to their home address, and follow-up work will be done with parents.

The order also gives officers the power to seize anything used in the commission of anti-social behaviour.

No further incidents took place.

Inspector Steve Goodier said "We know that anti-social behaviour has a negative impact on those living and working in the St Mary's area and this behaviour is appalling.

"Our officers are on the ground today patrolling the area in order to disperse groups of youths who are seen hanging around the area and we will continue to patrol the area over the coming weeks to engage with the community and keep the public safe.

"Anyone who witnesses anti-social behaviour or large gatherings of people should call 101 or report it to us online at www.hampshire.police.uk. If a crime is in progress, call 999.

"This is not related to COVID-19, but of course we would like to remind everyone of the government advice to stay at home: www.gov.uk/coronavirus."
