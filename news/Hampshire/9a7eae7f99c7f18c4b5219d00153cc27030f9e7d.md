We are appealing for witnesses following a burglary at Sant Jewellers in Southampton on November 14.

Just before 9pm, four men forced entry to the store, in Portswood Road, before stealing several thousand pounds worth of jewellery.

When the men left the store again, they made off in the direction of Abbotts Way.

Officers have been making enquiries and we are keen to speak with anyone who may have information about the burglary.

We are particularly keen to speak with anybody who saw people acting suspicious near the service road from Highfield Lane adjacent to Portswood Road.

We also want to speak with anyone who is offered any of the stolen items for sale, or sees them being sold.

Anyone with information should call 101, quoting the reference 44200442006.
