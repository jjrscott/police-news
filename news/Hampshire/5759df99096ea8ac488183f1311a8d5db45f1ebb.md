Do you recognise these two men?

We would like to identify them as part of an investigation into a theft in Lymington.

It took place at around 5.50pm, back on Saturday 14 December.

A handbag was stolen from the front seat of a car that was parked in High Street, near the junction with Anchor Mews.

The victim, a woman in her 60s, was loading shopping into her car at the time.

The handbag contained a purse with bank cards and cash.

Following enquiries, we are now releasing CCTV images of two men, who we believe may hold information that could help our investigation.

Do you know who they are?

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44190449308.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
