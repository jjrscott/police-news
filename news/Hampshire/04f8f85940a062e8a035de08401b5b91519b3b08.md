We have released a CCTV image of a man we want to speak to after an attempted robbery in Southampton.

At 3.40pm on Saturday 20 February a man entered Lodge Road Convenience Store and approached the till while carrying a knife. He threatened staff and demanded they hand over cash from the till.

No cash was handed over and he left empty handed.

No-one was injured.

Anyone with information should call police on 101 quoting 44210064273.
