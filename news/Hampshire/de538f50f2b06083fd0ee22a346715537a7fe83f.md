We are issuing a scam warning after residents in East Hampshire were conned into handing over thousands of pounds after being persuaded into taking it out of the bank.

The fraudsters telephoned their victims, claiming to be police officers who said they were investigating the use of counterfeit money by banks.

They persuaded their victims they needed to withdraw money from the bank so that it could be tested after being collected by couriers.

Between August 7 and August 22, there were three reported incidents in East Hampshire.

The fraudsters targeted a man in his 80s from Liphook, a man in his 80s from Petersfield and a woman in her 80s, also from Petersfield, who were all persuaded to hand over cash worth thousands of pounds.

Officers have spoken to all three victims and will follow-up to provide advice and reassurance.

Please be on your guard against fraudsters and follow this advice:

 * Please remember that police officers will never call people in this way and ask you to withdraw money or disclose personal or financial information. If someone does do this, please hang up - it will be a scam.
 * Consider contacting your telephone provider to get a free call-blocking service if you are getting unsolicited calls.
 * If you are a friend, relative or carer of someone you think might be vulnerable to this type of scam, please speak to them about this advice. You might be the only person who can stop them from being scammed.

If you or someone you know has been a victim of this type of fraud, report it to us by calling 101. If a crime is in progress, dial 999.

You can make yourself aware of this type of scam and how to protect yourself against them by visiting the Action Fraud website (https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/) or by calling them on 0300 123 2040.
