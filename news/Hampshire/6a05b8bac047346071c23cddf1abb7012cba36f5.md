The family of a woman who sadly died following a collision in Southampton on the morning of Friday 6 November have paid tribute to her.

We were called to a report of a collision involving a Ford Focus and pedestrian in Bassett Green Road, Southampton, around 7.30am.

Emergency services attended and Paula White, 92, of Bassett Green Court, Southampton, was taken to hospital. Sadly, she later passed away.

Paying tribute to her today, her family said: "Paula White, aged 92, taken from us suddenly. A loving mother, Grandma and Great Grandma, forever in our hearts."

Officers continue to investigate the exact circumstances of the collision and are keen to speak with anyone who can assist their enquiries.

They particularly wish to speak with the driver of a white Volkswagen Tiguan which had been driving along Bassett Green Road at the time, as they may have important information which could assist.

Anyone with information or who may have dash cam footage of the incident should call 101, quoting 44200430388.
