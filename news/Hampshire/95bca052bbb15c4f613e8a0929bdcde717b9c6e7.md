We are appealing for witnesses, or anyone with information, to come forward following an assault in Holbury.

The incident occurred between 4.45pm and 4.55pm at Cadland Primary School on Saturday 6 February; whereby two boys were seen to be trespassing on the roof of the school. They were challenged by a passer-by, when one of the boys assaulted the 17-year-old girl by punching her in the face and fleeeing towards Mark Drake Park.

He is described as white, aged 15-16, approximately 5ft 6ins, skinny build with quite short mousey brown hair and a mole on his cheek. He was wearing dark clothing, possibly a hooded jacket and carrying a black rucksack at the time of the incident.

The other boy involved had already fled the scene.

Our officers have conducted initial lines of enquiry but are now turning to the public for help.

We would like to speak with the boy in connection with the incident.

Were you in the area at the time or did you see anyone acting suspiciously? Perhaps you have CCTV, Ring doorbell or dash-cam footage?

Anyone with information relating to this incident is asked to call 101, quoting 44210046151.

Alternatively, you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
