We are appealing for information following a collision between a car and a cyclist that happened on the Red Lion Roundabout on Tuesday 30 June at 10.30am.

The cyclist, a woman in her 50s, was knocked off her bike by a small black car. Initially the driver of the car stopped to help, but then they left the scene without leaving their details.

The woman suffered injuries to her ribs.

We are appealing to the driver of that car to come forward so that details can be exchanged.

Was this you?
