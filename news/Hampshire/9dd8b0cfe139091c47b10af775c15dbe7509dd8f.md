We are appealing for information after an elderly couple fell victim to a fraud in Waterlooville.

Between noon and 12.30pm on Saturday 23 November, a man pretending to be from a well-known drainage company visited the couple at their home in Corbett Road.

He said there had been a drain blockage further down the road. On checking their drain, he informed them it was fine and they were entitled to a refund due to the inconvenience caused.

The man said the money could be paid straight into their account and asked for their bank card. This was placed into a card reader and they gave the man their PIN when requested.

It was not until the couple attended their bank on Monday 25 November that they were informed their account had been emptied.

The man has been described as white, about 5ft 8ins tall and of medium build.

He was wearing a grey woolly hat but short, light brown hair could be seen from the sides.

He was wearing a grey/brown suit type jacket and a grey cotton shirt with a round neck t-shirt underneath. He wore light coloured trousers.

No vehicle was seen.

Anyone being told a similar story should call the police. Do not allow anyone to enter your home unless you have arranged this yourself and have seen identification. If in any doubt contact the police.
