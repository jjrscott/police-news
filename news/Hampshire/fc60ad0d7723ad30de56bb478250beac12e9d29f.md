A 22-year-old Farnborough man has been sentenced to 26 weeks in prison after pleading guilty to spitting in the face of a paramedic.

Daniel Jankovic, of Fernhill Road, Farnborough, was sentenced to 20 weeks for assaulting an emergency worker in Victoria Road, Aldershot, on April 7. He was also ordered to pay the victim £200 compensation when he appeared before Basingstoke Magistrates Court today, (Thursday).

The court heard the paramedic was sat in an ambulance waiting for a colleague who was attending to a casualty at an address nearby. Jankovic approached the ambulance and asked who they were treating.

When the paramedic refused to tell him any details, Jankovic spat in his face. The incident was caught on the council's CCTV camera.

Police attended and Jankovic then made off, running onto the railway line in an attempt to get away.

He also pleaded guilty to trespass but no separate penalty was given.

Jankovic was however sentenced to a further six weeks for theft from a motor vehicle in Honington Mews, Farnborough, on March 31. He was seen gaining access to a Ford Focus and stealing a £10 note from inside.

He was further sentenced to another six weeks in custody, to run consecutively, for breaching a Criminal Behaviour Order he was under at the time of the theft offence.

He also received no further penalty for possessing a small amount of cannabis on March 31.
