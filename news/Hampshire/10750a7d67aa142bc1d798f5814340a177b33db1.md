Three people have been arrested following a robbery of a 25 year old man in Basingstoke.

The robbery is alleged to have taken place between 3pm and 4pm on Thursday, February 27, in Glebe Gardens, Basingstoke.

The three arrested are:

• A 30 year old man from Basingstoke

• A 17 year old man from Basingstoke

• A 24 year old man from Basingstoke

All three currently remain in custody.

Basingstoke Neighbourhood Inspector Richard Lane said: "We continue to ask people but particularly young men to follow common sense advice and try and walk with a group of friends.

"Don't be distracted by using a mobile phone or listening to music, walk in well-lit places and stick to routes where there are lots of other people."

"If you can avoid it, don't make it obvious if you are carrying expensive gadgets.

"We would like to reassure the community that there are increased patrols across the town. If you have any concerns, don't hesitate to approach the officers."
