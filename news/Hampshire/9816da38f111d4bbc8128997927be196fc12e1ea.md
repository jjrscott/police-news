We're appealing for witnesses and footage after two men were assaulted by a group on mopeds in St Denys on Saturday.

The 57-year-old and 70-year-old were walking along Priory Road just before 1am on Saturday when they were approached by five people on mopeds.

The group assaulted the two men, leaving the 57-year-old with swelling and cuts to his head and the 70-year-old with a cut to his head and a suspected fractured arm.

The group were made up of four men, who were riding mopeds and a woman who was riding as a pillion passenger on one of the mopeds. The woman had blonde hair which was in a ponytail. All the men had crash helmets on.

The incident happened between the Junction Inn and the railway bridge. We received two reports of a group on motorbikes causing noise in South Road around the same time the men were assaulted.

Detective Inspector Steve Spencer from the Western Investigation Team said:

"We have scoped CCTV opportunities, conducted house to house enquiries, and we will follow up all lines of enquiry to identify responsible."

"As part of our investigation we are keen to speak to residents who may have private CCTV or have dash cam footage, and anyone who witnessed this incident or a group on mopeds in the area at the time and have not yet spoken to us."

Anyone with information is asked to call us on 101, quoting 44190392986, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
