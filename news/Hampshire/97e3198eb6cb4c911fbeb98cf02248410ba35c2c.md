We are appealing for witnesses after two bikes were stolen from a residential property in Eastleigh.

The incident took place at approximately 3pm on Monday 13 July, where a man and a woman were seen by a member of the public stealing two bikes from a garage on Leigh Road.

The suspects stole a red Carrerra Kraken mountain bike and a black Focus Raider mountain bike. They were then seen cycling away towards Eastleigh town centre.

The female is described as white, brightly coloured dyed hair and wearing jean shorts. While the male is described as white, approximately 5ft 10" and wearing a white t-shirt and shorts.

We have today released images of two people we would to speak with in connection with the incident.

Do you recognise them? Were you in the area at the time? Do you have any dash cam footage?

Anyone with any information about this incident is asked to get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200259200.
