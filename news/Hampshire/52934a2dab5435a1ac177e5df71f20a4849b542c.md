We are looking to speak to the male pictured in the CCTV in connection with a knifepoint robbery in a Basingstoke shop.

The incident occurred at 6.15pm on Saturday, March 15, at Bhuller store in St Peter's Road.

Two suspects entered the shop and one threatened staff with a knife and demanded cash. Staff were quick to respond and chased the pair out of the store empty handed.

Do you recognise the male? If you can help, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200096999.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
