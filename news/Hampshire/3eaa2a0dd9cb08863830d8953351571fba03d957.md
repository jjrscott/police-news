A trio of knitters came to Basingstoke Police Investigation Centre today last week, to hand over their fantastic haul of 'Bobby Buddies' - designed to help children who might need comfort in traumatic situations.

The ladies, Jennifer Peskett of Odiham, Joan Lucas from Basingstoke and Gillian Edwards, also from Basingstoke, are just three members of an army of volunteers who have devoted their spare time to create hundreds of the handcrafted teddies.

Basingstoke Rural Neighbourhood Team Inspector Hannah Luchesa said: "We are so grateful to these ladies and all the other volunteers who have created the Bobby Buddies.

"The idea of the buddies is that officers can hand them out to children who may be going through a distressing experience such as a road traffic incident, domestic abuse or bereavement.

"These bears could really make a difference and offer reassurance and comfort at times of trauma. Thank you again to everyone who has contributed."

If you are a knitting enthusiast and would like to help, please email basingstoke.rural.police@hampshire.pnn.police.uk and we will send you the pattern.

Any finished bears can be handed in at the front counters of Southampton, Portsmouth, Fareham or Basingstoke police stations.
