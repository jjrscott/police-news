A further dispersal order has been put in place in Hawley Lakes and surrounding areas for next weekend.

Neighbourhood Inspector Phil Mayne authorised the second order on consecutive weekends on behalf of Hampshire Constabulary and the Ministry of Defence Police. The new order will run from 6pm on Friday, June 5 to 6pm on Sunday, June 7.

The orders are in response to reports of disorder caused by large groups of people on May 25.

Inspector Mayne said: "The order was successful last weekend in that there were no reports of disorder in the area. There were several large groups of teenagers but as soon as they saw police, they left the area without any issues.

"These orders give us powers to disperse large groups of people out of the Lakes, Woods and surrounding area and we can continue to extend their use as necessary, in partnership with the MOD Police."

 The orders cover parts of the A327 and A30 and part of Fernhill Road and Sandy Lane as shown on the map.

High visibility patrols continue in the area to reassure the public and to deter large groups from congregating in the area.

Anyone who witnesses anti-social behaviour or large gatherings is encouraged to call 101, or if a crime or incident is in progress, always call 999.
