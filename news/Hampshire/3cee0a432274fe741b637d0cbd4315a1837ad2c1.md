We are appealing for witnesses and information after a 77 year old man was knocked to the ground during a robbery by four young males on bikes in Basingstoke.

The incident occurred at 8.15pm on Saturday, September 14, on a footpath at Greenways near West Ham Close, South Ham.

The victim, who is from Basingstoke, had been to Lidl's in South Ham to collect some shopping and was walking home.

He saw the four males, said to be aged between 14 and 18 and wearing hoodies, cycling towards him and he was then knocked to the ground and his bag of shopping was taken by the males.

The victim sustained bruising to the left side of his face which resulted in him not being able to see out of his left eye due to the swelling for two days. He also sustained bruising to his arms and hip.

He was taken to hospital for treatment but has since been discharged.

Neighbourhood Inspector Richard Lane said: "Whilst this type of incident is extremely rare, this was an appalling assault on an elderly and vulnerable man.

"We would appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity between 8.15pm and 9pm on Saturday, September 14 and who may have seen a group of four males on bikes in the area.

"If you have any information, or if you have dashcam footage, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting 44190330676."
