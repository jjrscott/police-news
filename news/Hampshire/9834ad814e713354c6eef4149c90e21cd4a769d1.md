Officers investigating an assault in Sandown last Thursday have this evening charged a man.

Rhys Patrick Davies, 31, of no fixed address, has been charged with GBH and remanded in custody to appear at Isle of Wight Magistrates' Court tomorrow morning.

It comes after police were called to Crescent Road just after 11pm on Thursday, where a 35-year-old man had suffered a fractured skull.

He remains in hospital.

A 19-year-old man from Newport and 34-year-old man from Ryde who were also both arrested after the incident have been released with no further action.
