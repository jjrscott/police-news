A police officer conducting a routine stop check on a vehicle in Hedge End has today (27 January) arrested a man.

The incident occurred at 1am on Wednesday 27 January after an officer stopped a vehicle in Portelet Place which showed as not having any insurance. An altercation ensued as the officer attempted to arrest the individual - but the man was successfully detained.

A search of the vehicle was negative, but a drugs wipe indicated a positive result for a Class A drug.

A 24-year-old man from Southampton was arrested on suspicion of driving whilst unfit through drink or drugs and assaulting an emergency services worker.

He remains in custody at this time.
