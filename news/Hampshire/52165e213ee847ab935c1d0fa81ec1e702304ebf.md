The family of a man who died in a collision on the A338 Salisbury Road have today paid tribute to him.

We were called just after 2.20pm on Friday 19 June to a report of a collision involving a red Vauxhall Astra and a white Toyota Aygo on the A338 between Breamore and Downton.

Malcolm Reynolds, 82, of Allenwater Drive, was taken to hospital but was sadly pronounced dead a short while later.

Paying tribute to him today, his family said: "Beloved brother to Keith, Dennis, Norman and Sue. Husband of the late Christine, and father to Hannah and James.

"He also leaves behind three cherished grandchildren, and his companion Barbara.

"Malcolm was a wonderful father and much loved grandfather.

"He took great pleasure in the company of his friends and family, and although on the surface a quiet and unassuming man he had a great love of storytelling and an, often unexpectedly, quick wit.

"His gentleness and kindness was appreciated by all who knew him.

"He led active life with a wide circle of friends stretching from his school days, to former work colleagues and most recently his yoga club in Fordingbrige, he was also a member of Kinson Conservative Club.

"A great lover of life Malcolm was taken far too soon, we are devastated by this sudden loss. He will be sorely missed by many, especially his children and grandchildren."

Officers investigating the collision continue to appeal for information, or dash cam footage, that may assist us in our investigation.
