Two men have been charged with the production of cannabis after a cultivation of 75 plants was found at an address in Southampton.

We were called to an address in Charlton Road around 10.30am on Friday 27 November.

Arben Hamzaj, 34, of no fixed abode, and Klinton Vila, 27, of Victory Road, Southampton, were arrested at the scene.

They have both been charged with being concerned in the production of a controlled drug of class B.

Both were remanded in custody and appeared at Southampton Magistrates' Court yesterday.
