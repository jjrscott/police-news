We are appealing for information after a serious collision on the A34 near Sutton Scotney last night.

Officers were called at 6.55pm to a two vehicle collision involving a red Skoda Fabia and blue VW Polo on the northbound carriageway, just south of Sutton Scotney Services.

One person was taken to Southampton General Hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries.

Anyone who saw the incident or has dash cam footage in the area at around that time should contact us on 101 quoting 44190432405.

The northbound carriageway was closed for a time.

A 22-year-old man from Andover was arrested on suspicion of:

 * Driving a motor vehicle with a proportion of a specified controlled drug above the specified limit
 * Causing serious injury by dangerous driving
 * Driving a vehicle whilst unfit through drugs. He has been released from custody but remains under investigation.
