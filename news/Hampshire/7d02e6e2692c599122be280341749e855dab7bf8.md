We are appealing for witnesses after an electric scooter, two mobile phones, bag and bicycle were stolen in Havant last night (July 1).

Just before 6.30pm, a group of three children were approached by a pair of boys believed to be around 15 to 17 years old in Market Parade, who demanded they hand over their possessions.

During the incident, one of the boys lifted up his shirt to show what looked to be a knife in his waistband.

After the left the scene, officers believe the boys went to Havant railway station and boarded a train.

Officers investigating the incident are keen to speak with anyone who may have information that will assist them.

The first boy is described as being black, wearing a navy puffer jacket and navy tracksuit trousers.

While the second is described as being white, and wearing a black puffer jacket and black tracksuit trousers.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200241016. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
