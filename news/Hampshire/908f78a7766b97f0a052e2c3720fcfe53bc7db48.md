Do you recognise these two men?

We'd like to speak to them following an assault on a woman in Portsmouth in the early hours of July 21.

You may remember that we've previously appealed for information about this incident, which happened at around 1.30am as the woman was walking along Crasswell Street, Paradise Street and Lake Road.

She was followed by two men on bicycles, who assaulted her, leaving her with bruising to her arm.

Now we're asking for your help to identify the two men seen in this CCTV image, as we believe they may have information which could help our investigation.

If this is you or if you think you know who they are, please call us on 101, quoting 44190254628, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
