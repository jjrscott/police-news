## Christy Flaherty

Can you help us locate wanted man, Christy Flaherty?

Flaherty is 26-years-old and wanted on recall to prison to complete his sentence for arson endangering life after he recently breached the conditions of his license.

Flaherty is from Southampton and is still believed to be in Hampshire.

We have been carrying out a number of enquiries to locate him, and now we would like to ask the public to help us find him.

Flaherty is described as

• White
• 5 feet 7 inches
• Slim build
• Dark brown hair
• Blue eyes

Flaherty knows that he is wanted on recall and is deliberately evading arrest.

Do you know where he is?

Members of the public should not approach Flaherty. If you see him, or know where he is, please call police immediately on 999, quoting 44190368769.

Alternatively, you can contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.

Anyone found to be harbouring Flaherty to deliberately obstruct our attempts to locate him may be committing an offence and be liable for arrest and prosecution themselves.
