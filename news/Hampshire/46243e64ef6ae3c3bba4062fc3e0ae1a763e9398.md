We are appealing for witnesses after a 54-year-old man was assaulted on Redlands Lane in Fareham in the early hours of this morning.

The incident happened between 12.15am and 12.35am.

The man suffered head injuries and is in hospital today as a result.

We arrested two men, aged 37 and 33, both from Fareham, on suspicion of assault and robbery.

They remain in police custody at this time.

Detective Inspector Abbie Leeson from the Eastern Investigations Team would like to appeal for further witnesses: "We are appealing to anyone who witnessed this incident who has not yet spoken to us to come forward and make contact."
