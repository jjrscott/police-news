We are appealing for witnesses and information after a cash point on Station Road was damaged in the early hours of this morning (August 14).

We were called at 1.55am to a report of theft of a cash from an ATM on Station Road by the First Stop shop in Sholing, Southampton.

We deployed to the area and found the cash machine had been damaged and the cash contents had been stolen.

We know that several members of the public called in and reported hearing an explosion at the time of the incident.

We will be at the scene today carrying out enquiries and would ask anyone with information about this incident to contact us.

Please call 101 and quote 44190287362.
