We are appealing for information following an attempted burglary at The Farmers Home pub in Durley.

At about 11.45pm on Monday 8 July, attempts were made to break in to the pub.

A group of males wearing hooded tops tried to prise open a door, after smashing a pane of glass, in order to gain access to the property.

They left the scene when a light in the pub was turned on. Nothing was stolen.

We're looking for anyone with information about this incident to come forward and help us with our enquiries.

We have released CCTV images of people we would like to speak to as part of our investigation.

Were you in the area at the time of the burglary? Do you recognise the individuals in the CCTV images?

If you have any information, please call 101, quoting 44190238087, or contact the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
