We are asking people to be vigilant following reports of shed and garage break-ins in Denmead.

We have received reports of five burglaries in the past three weeks. In each incident, thieves have targeted sheds and garages and stolen bicycles from inside.

The burglaries have been carried out between 9pm and 7am and the value of the bikes stolen range from £400 to £1,500.

The burglaries took place in Three Acres, Forest Mead, Hambledon Road, Ashling Gardens and Upper Piece.

Officers are looking to see if these incidents are linked, and are also carrying out targeted patrols.

We would like to hear from anyone with information on these incidents. Have you been offered a bicycle for sale recently? Have you noticed anything suspicious?

Perhaps something similar has happened to you recently and you have yet to report it to the police?

If so, please call us on 101.

**Advice**

We would like to remind people of some measures they can take to protect their property:

• Use of good padlock on the door to your shed or garage with no exposed screws
• Keep it locked at all times
• Consider fitting a battery-operated shed alarm with a loud siren
• Secure your bike to the ground or lockable stand within a locked shed or garage. Visit https://www.soldsecure.com/ to search for ground anchors or other security products
• Think about what a thief might see from any window of your shed or garage. Keep your valuable items covered from view.
