We are appealing for witnesses after receiving several reports of vehicles driving the wrong way on the M3.

Between 1pm and 1.40pm on Sunday, 25 October, it was reported that at least ten cars were seen driving the wrong way on the Junction 4 slip road to Farnborough.

Officers are investigating and are keen to speak with anyone with information that may help identify the drivers.

We are particularly keen to receive any dash-cam footage that may have captured the vehicles driving the wrong-way on the slip road.

Anyone with information is asked to make contact via 101, or by emailing their details and footage to northeast.road.policing@hampshire.pnn.police.uk, with the reference 44200415733.
