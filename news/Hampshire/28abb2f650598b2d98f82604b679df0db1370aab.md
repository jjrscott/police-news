We are appealing for witnesses after a collision in Manners Road, Southsea around 9.20am today (December 7).

The incident occurred following a short pursuit involving a police car and a grey Audi A4. The Audi collided with a number of vehicles.

The driver of the Audi, a 20-year-old man from Portsmouth, has been arrested on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle, dangerous driving and failing to stop.

Officers investigating the collision are keen to speak with any witnesses.

They are particularly keen to speak with the driver of a dark blue van, which was at the junction of Talbot Road and Manners Road at the time of the collision, who we believe will have important information to assist the investigation.

Anyone with information should call 101, quoting the reference 44200471756.
