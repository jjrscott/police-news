We're appealing for witnesses after a man was stabbed in Park Walk, Southampton.

The incident happened at around 3pm yesterday, Sunday, 28 March in Park Walk near East Park in Southampton.

A 26-year-old man received a stab wound to his shoulder after being approached from behind by two men on bicycles.

The men immediately rode off in the direction of Houndwell Park and East Street.

The 26-year-old was taken to hospital for treatment. His injuries are not believed to be life threatening.

Officers have released a CCTV image of two men they would like to speak to in connection with this incident.

Both men are described as being aged between 25 to 35 and one of them was wearing a patterned jacket with a blue hoody underneath.

We know you can't see their faces but do you recognise the men in this image? Perhaps you recognise their clothing?

Were you in the area at the time? Did you see or hear anything? Anyone with any information should call 101 quoting 44210116385.

Alternatively people can call Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
