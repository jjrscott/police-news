Officers issued fixed penalty notices following a test purchase operation in Winchester.

Hampshire Constabulary's Licensing Team used volunteers to visit 29 premises in the city on Friday 16 August.

The purpose of the operation was to test age verification policies and training.

Staff at 26 of the venues passed the test by requesting ID and refusing the sale of alcohol to our 16-year-old volunteers.

Staff at three venues failed the test. They were issued a Â£90 fixed penalty notice and given appropriate advice.

The venues that failed the test were The Black Boy, in Wharf Hill, Greens Wine Bar, in Jewry Street, and The Willow Tree, in Durngate Terrace.

Licensing officer Colin Pollard said: "This operation took place on the first weekend after A-Level results day, and we wanted to make sure venues had the right processes to stop alcohol being served to underage people.

"We're pleased that most of the venues passed the spot checks, although it's disappointing to see that staff at three venues failed.

"We will look to visit those venues again in the coming months."
