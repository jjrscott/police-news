Police officers from Hampshire Constabulary's Marine Unit have been working hard to salvage furniture that will be shipped out to Zambia for a charity run school.

The furniture, which included whiteboards, notice boards, desks, chairs, projectors and shelving, was either surplus or due to be discarded.

Police Sergeant Matthew Gransden said: "In terms of recycling and responsibly using resources, we were really keen to make the most of this equipment for the benefit of others.

"It will be shipped out to Zambia in the next few weeks to form part of a new school wing. This is a really great project to get involved in and we are really proud to have played a part in this charity's work."

Matthew and his colleagues have organised the shipping of the equipment through UK charity Future Pillars for Zambia, which works to empower vulnerable children in the country.

The furniture and equipment will be donated to the Family Futures Community School via Future Pillars for Zambia.
