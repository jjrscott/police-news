A second arrest has been made in connection with the ongoing attempted murder investigation in Yateley.

We were called just after 3.30pm on Tuesday 16 March to reports of a firearm being discharged at a black Mercedes on Reading Road at the junction with Darby Green Road.

Shortly afterward, at around 3.40pm a firearm was heard to be discharged in the area of Croft Lane, Yateley.

A man, aged 21 from Ash Vale, was initially arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and possession of a firearm. He was yesterday, 18 March, released on police bail but has today been re-arrested following further enquiries.

A 23-year-old man from Yateley has also been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. He remains in custody at this time.

We continue to appeal for any information in relation to this incident, and ask people to call 101 with the reference 44210098347.
