A man has been jailed for 30 months after pleading guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving.

In the early hours of 22 April 2019, Patrick Langley, aged 22, of Sutherland Chase, Ascot, chose to drive his car after drinking and taking drugs.

He then struck a pedestrian - a man in his 20s - at a crossing point on Fleet Road, Fleet while driving on the wrong side of the road at speed.

He was sentenced on 27 January at Winchester Crown Court to 30 months in prison.

He was also disqualified from driving for 51 months and is required to undertake an extended re-test at the end of his disqualification to get his licence back.

PC Timothy Peirce said:

"It is a miracle that nobody else was seriously injured or killed, as there were numerous other pedestrians in and around the road while Langley was driving in this appalling manner.

"Due to his actions and total disregard for the safety of other roads users, the pedestrian sustained devastating, life changing injuries.

"Due to the completely selfish and thoughtless actions of Langley, the victim, his family and friends will now have to live with the catastrophic consequences of this incident for the rest of their lives.

"I hope this case will once again highlight the responsibility that falls on all drivers to drive their vehicles safely and with due regard to all other road users.

"The consequences of dangerous driving, along with drink and drug driving, are all too clear to see."
