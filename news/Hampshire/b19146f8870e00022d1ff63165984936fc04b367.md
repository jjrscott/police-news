We are appealing for witnesses following a serious road traffic collision in Bordon this morning which has left a woman with serious injuries.

A black Vauxhall Corsa was travelling south on the A325, near to Sleaford, when it was in collision with a tree at around 7.45am this morning (August 5).

The driver, a 26-year-old woman from Bordon, was taken to hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries.

We would like to appeal to anyone who may have seen what happened this morning, to make contact with us.

Dash-cam footage viewed at the scene suggests a white Enterprise van may have been travelling ahead of the Vauxhall Corsa, we would also like to speak to the driver of this vehicle to see if they witnessed anything that may help us find the cause of the collision.

If you were on this stretch of road this morning, witnessed anything, or have dash-cam footage that may be able to help us, please get in touch.

Call 101 and quote 44200294410.
