Officers investigating a number of burglaries in Portsmouth have arrested a man on suspicion of several offences.

The 18-year-old from Winchester was arrested yesterday (Wednesday 20 January) on suspicion of:

 * Two aggravated burglaries
 * Dwelling burglary with intent to steal
 * Theft
 * Possession of a knife/sharp pointed article in a public place
 * Two threats to kill
 * Possession of an offensive weapon in a public place

The arrest is in relation to the following incidents:

 * On Wednesday 16 December at approximately 9.20pm, a man pulled up next to another car at traffic lights on Fratton Road and made threatening gestures with a knife. He also swerved into the victim's car, causing damage to the front of the vehicle.
 * On Monday 11 January at around 1.20am, a group of men forced entry into a property on Cressy Road and demanded money from the occupants. The men left without taking anything. No-one was injured.
 * On Monday 18 January at around 10.05pm, the front door of a house was broken and entry was gained into an address on Trevor Road. Nothing was taken and nobody was hurt.
