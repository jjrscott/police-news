We are appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted and his shopping stolen as he walked home in Winchester on Sunday afternoon.

The 19-year-old man was walking from Fromond Road to Stoney Lane on December 15 when he was stopped by three youths.

He was then knocked to the ground and assaulted, before having his shopping stolen.

The man suffered injuries to his wrist, face and legs.

We are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the assault or who saw a group of youths in the area between 3.40pm and 4.05pm on Sunday afternoon.

Three boys, aged 15, 16 and 17 and all from Winchester, were arrested on suspicion of robbery and have been released on bail.

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44190450565. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
