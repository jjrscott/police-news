We're appealing for information following a knifepoint robbery at a Portsmouth shop.

At around 10.25pm on Saturday 21 December, two men entered One Stop on Hayling Avenue and made threats and demands towards staff for cigarettes and money from the till. One of the men was carrying a knife.

The men left the store with a bag full of cigarettes and approximately Â£300 in cash.

We would like to hear from anyone with information about this incident, or who saw either of the two men pictured in the Baffins area of Portsmouth that night.

If you can assist our enquiries, please call us on 101, quoting 44190458284.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
