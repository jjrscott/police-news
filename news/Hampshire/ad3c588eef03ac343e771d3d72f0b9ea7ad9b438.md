We are appealing for witnesses after an attempted robbery in Fleet.

The incident happened at around 6pm on Tuesday, 23 February, on Kent Road.

The victim, a 19-year-old man from Fleet, was walking on Kent Road with a friend when they were approached by a group of around six men.

The group made demands that they empty their pockets and assaulted the 19-year-old causing minor injuries to his head.

The suspects made off empty handed.

We are appealing for any witnesses to the robbery, or anyone with any information that could help our enquiries to come forward.

We are particularly keen to identify the group responsible, they are described as follows:

 * A white man aged between 17 and 19-years-old, approximately 6ft tall, wearing a dark green coat with a fur trim on the hood and gloves.
 * A white man aged between 17 and 19-years-old, between 5ft 7ins and 5ft 8 ins tall with a chubby build. He was described as wearing a hood up, a beanie hat, and a face mask. He also had a boxed-style man bag.
 * A white man aged between 17 and 19-years-old, between 5ft 7ins and 5ft 8ins tall, with a skinny build.

Were you in the area at the time? Perhaps you remember seeing a group with some matching the descriptions above?

We would also like to speak with a member of the public who stopped to help the victims.

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 with the reference 44210068768. Alternatively, you can phone Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
