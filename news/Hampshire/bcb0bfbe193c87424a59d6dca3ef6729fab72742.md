We're asking people in Southampton to report anything they might have seen to assist our investigation into a robbery attempt.

Between 6.20pm and 6.40pm yesterday evening (Thursday 29 August), a man in his 20s was riding his bike on Above Bar Street when he was approached by a man he did not know between Poundland and the entrance to West Quay.

The man demanded the victim hand over his bike. The victim ignored the demands and cycled off towards West Quay, but was scratched on the arm with a knife as he did so.

Maybe you saw this incident, or part of it? The victim was riding a black and green mountain bike, and the man who approached him is described as wearing white trousers and a black T-shirt.

If you saw anything, please call us on 101, quoting 44190307937.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
