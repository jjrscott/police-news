Officers in Portsmouth arrested two men for drugs offences yesterday afternoon.

Our officers stopped a BMW on South Parade, Southsea, just before 4pm yesterday (April 23) and seized an amount of cash. The car has also been seized.

A 19-year-old man and a 24-year-old man, both from London, have been arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a Class A drug.

They remain in custody at this time.

Despite the ongoing pandemic, our officers remain committed to tackling crime and making our communities safer. This work does not stop.
