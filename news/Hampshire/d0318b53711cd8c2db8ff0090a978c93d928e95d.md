We are appealing for witnesses after a hit and run collision in Waterlooville between a car and a 69-year-old woman.

The collision took place at around 10 am yesterday, 3 September, on Hulbert Road at the pedestrian crossing outside of the residential home.

The woman was hit by a small, light coloured car as she was crossing the road. The car is believed to have gone through a red light.

Luckily, her injuries are not described as serious.

The driver, a man described as being in his 70's with white hair, briefly stopped at the scene before driving off without leaving details.

Officers investigating the collision are keen to speak with anyone who might be able to assist their enquiries.

Unfortunately we have no further description of the car.

Were you in the area at the time, or do you have dash-cam footage of the incident? Perhaps you were the driver of the vehicle involved?

Anyone with information should call 101, quoting 44200176250.
