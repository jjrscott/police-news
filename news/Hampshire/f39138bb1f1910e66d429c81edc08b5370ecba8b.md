We are now in a position to confirm the identity of a motorcyclist who died in a collision in Hook.

Officers were called to the B3349 Reading Road, at the junction with Vicarage Lane in Hound Green, at 10.30pm on Tuesday 17 September.

It was reported that a motorcycle and a silver car had collided. The driver of the car failed to stop at the scene.

Tenny Turner (Snr), 53, of Hound Green Close, Hound Green, died as a result of the collision.

A 25-year-old man from the Reading area was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He has been released from custody but remains under investigation.

We would like to thank everyone who shared our appeal, and can confirm that we have now recovered the silver vehicle we believe to be involved in the collision.

We would continue to ask anyone with information about the collision to report it to us on 101, quoting 44190332625.
