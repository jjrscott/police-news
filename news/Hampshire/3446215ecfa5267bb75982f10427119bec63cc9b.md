Officers have released a CCTV image of a group of people they want to speak to after a man was assaulted in Portsmouth.

The incident happened at around 12.30am on the morning of Thursday, 3 October. The victim, a 20-year-old man, was next to the Civic Offices on Guildhall Square when he was assaulted.

He suffered a serious head injury and was taken to hospital by ambulance, where he remains receiving treatment for his injury.

Detective Constable Nicholas Sandford-Smith, said: "We're appealing for anyone with information about this incident to come forward and speak to us.

"We have issued a CCTV image of five people we'd like to speak to. We know the image isn't particularly clear, but we think that if you know any of these people, you'll recognise them; or you may have seen them out that night and recognise them from their clothing. We would urge these people, or anyone who recognises them, to get in touch with us.

"We are also appealing for anyone who witnessed the assault, or saw the group of people shown in the CCTV in the area, before or after the assault."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Hampshire Constabulary on 101 quoting 44190352614.
