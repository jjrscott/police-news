Officers investigating the death of 20-year-old Sol Hemy have arrested and questioned a man on suspicion of murder.

Sol's body was found in the water at Riverside Park on September 5, 2019 following a burglary at an address on River Walk where gun shots were fired and a group broke into a house being used to cultivate cannabis.

Officers investigating Sol's death arrested a 30-year-old man from Southampton on suspicion of murder and questioned him in custody.

The man was also arrested on suspicion of possession of another person's identity document and obtaining/acquiring/using criminal property.

He was released on bail until January 24, 2021 to allow for further enquiries.

The investigation is ongoing.
