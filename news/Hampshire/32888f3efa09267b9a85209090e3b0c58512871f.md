Throughout December, officers from our Roads Policing Unit have been supporting the national campaign targeting motorists who choose to get behind the wheel while impaired.

Last Friday night, December 18, a number of stops were carried out on Northam Road, Southampton, close to the industrial estate.

Of the 33 drivers stopped, two failed a roadside drugs wipe and one blew a positive reading for alcohol and was arrested for drink driving.

Along with the positive drink and drug tests, officers also dealt with:

 * Three vehicle seizures for no insurance
 * Two drivers being reported for traffic offences
 * 25 motorists given advice for minor motoring offences
 * and one vehicle which failed to stop, leading to further enquiries as the registration number was obtained.

Driving while impaired through drink or drugs can, and does, have tragic consequences.

Officers will be continuing to carry out stops over Christmas and New Year.

While this Christmas is going to be different for many people, please do not get behind the wheel of a vehicle while impaired. Alcohol can still be in your system and affect you the morning after, so please consider how much you are drinking carefully if you need to drive.

Our message is simple; it's not worth the risk.
