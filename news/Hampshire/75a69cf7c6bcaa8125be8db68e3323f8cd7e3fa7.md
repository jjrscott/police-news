We are appealing for dash cam after a woman was robbed of her purse on Twyford Road on Sunday evening (Sunday 24 November).

The woman was walking along Twyford Road towards the Tesco Express just after 6pm when she was approached from behind by man near the junction of Albert Road.

The man grabbed the woman's purse and hit her in the face before running off.

The man has been described as white, slender build, about 5 feet 10 inches tall and was wearing a grey or white baseball cap and grey tracksuit.

We deployed and carried out a search of the area, however no one matching the description was located.

Can you help?

We would like to hear from drivers with dash cam who were travelling along this road at around 6pm on Sunday evening.

If you think might have footage that could assist us, please get in touch.

Call 101 and quote 44190422842.
