We are appealing for witnesses and information following a racially aggravated assault on a woman in her 40s by four young males.

The incident occurred between 6.30pm and 7.45pm on Monday, October 19 between the Curly Bridge and Cove Brook Bridge in Farnborough.

The victim, who is Nepalese, was walking on the footpath between the bridges when she was verbally abused by the group.

She was then knocked to the floor from behind and lost consciousness. She sustained an injured elbow and bruising to her face.

The youths are said to have been travelling on electric scooters and bicycles. They are described as being white males, all aged between 17 and 19. One of the males was taller than the others, with blonde hair. All were wearing dark clothing.

If you have any information about this incident, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200406822. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
