Do you recognise the man in this E-fit?

We want to speak to him about a robbery which took place in Sherborne St John.

Between 12.45am and 1am on 10 December, a man in his 30s was walking on Aldermaston Road when he was pushed to the ground from behind.

Two men then punched and kicked him before stealing his wallet, phone, and a packet of cigarettes.

Both men were described as white, aged in their 20s, with shaven heads. One was wearing a black puffer style jacket.

Can you help us identify the man pictured here, wearing a blue hoodie?

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44190443271.

Alternatively you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org.
