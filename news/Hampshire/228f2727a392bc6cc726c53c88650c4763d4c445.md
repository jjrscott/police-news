Updated News Post

We have now arrested a 14-year-old boy from Warsash on suspicion of attempted robbery as part of this investigation.

He remains in custody at this time.

*****

We're appealing for witnesses following an attempted robbery in Locks Heath.

A 14-year-old boy was approached by a male wearing a balaclava in Locks Road, at around 7.35am on February 6.

As the teenager ran off, he turned around and described seeing the male holding a knife.

Fortunately the 14-year-old did not suffer any injuries.

The male is described as being 5ft 10ins tall, white, of a slim build and he was wearing a thin black coat. He was also wearing black gloves and a black balaclava.

Officers have been carrying out house-to-house enquiries in the area since the incident, as well as analysing CCTV.

They are keen to speak to anyone who may have been in the area and saw someone acting suspiciously.

You may have been driving through the area at the time of the incident and either saw something or captured something on your dash cam.

If you think you can help please call us on 101, quoting 44200046172, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
