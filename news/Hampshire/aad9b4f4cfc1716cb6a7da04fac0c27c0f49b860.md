We're appealing for witnesses to a fatal collision which took place on the A34 last night (Monday 11 November).

Between 8.10pm and 8.15pm, a collision involving a silver Toyota Corolla and a lorry occurred on the southbound carriageway at Bullington Cross, approximately half a mile from Sutton Scotney services.

The driver of the Toyota, a man in his 60s from Feltham in London, was pronounced dead at the scene.

His next of kin have been informed.

The passengers in the vehicle, a boy and girl aged in their teens, sustained serious but not life-threatening injuries.

The lorry driver was uninjured.

The road was closed for several hours to allow emergency services to work at the scene, but has since re-opened.

Officers are keen to hear from anyone who saw either of these vehicles, the collision itself, or the moments leading up to it.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting Operation Mention.
