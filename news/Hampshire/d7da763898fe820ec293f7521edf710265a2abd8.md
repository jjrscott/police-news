We want to speak to these two men in connection with a burglary that took place in Southsea between Saturday 12 September and Sunday 13 September this year.

Between 8.45pm and 9.20pm, three people broke into Horatia House, Meriden Road.

Several hours later, between 2am and 3.30am on the morning of Sunday 13 September, they took a number of copper water tanks from the property.

Officers believe that the water tanks were then loaded into a large van or flatbed vehicle.

We have descriptions and CCTV imagery of two men who were seen in the area at the time.

The first man is described as:

 * Aged between 25 and 30-years-old
 * Around 6feet in height
 * White
 * Stocky build

The second man is described as:

 * Aged between 20 and 30-years-old
 * Around 5feet 8inches in height
 * White
 * Slim build

We appreciate that the images are not of the best quality, but they are all we have available at this time.

If you recognise either of these men or have any information, call 101 quoting reference 44200353485. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
