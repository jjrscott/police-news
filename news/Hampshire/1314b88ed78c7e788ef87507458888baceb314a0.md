Officers from Southampton's Neighbourhood Policing Team have set up a dispersal order as part of a clampdown on anti-social behaviour in the Townhill area.

The dispersal order will cover an area that includes Meggeson Avenue, River Walk, Woodmill Lane and Townhill Way. It will be in place between 3pm today (5 May) and 3pm on Thursday 7 May.

The order is in response to reports of anti-social behaviour caused by large groups of people.

It will give officers the power to disperse people involved in anti-social behaviour out of the town centre area.

Those under 16 will be taken be to their home address, and follow-up work will be done with parents.

The order also gives officers the power to seize anything used in the commission of anti-social behaviour.

Acting Chief Inspector Hayley O'Grady said: "We know that anti-social behaviour has a negative impact on those living and working in the area.

"Anyone who witnesses anti-social behaviour or large gatherings of people should call 101 or report it to us online at www.hampshire.police.uk.

"If a crime is in progress, call 999.

"This is not related to COVID-19, but of course we would like to remind everyone of the government advice to stay at home: www.gov.uk/coronavirus."
