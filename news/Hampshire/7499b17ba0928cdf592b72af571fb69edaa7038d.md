We are appealing for witnesses following an aggravated burglary at a home in Cromwell Road that happened just after 8.30pm on Friday 28 August.

It has been reported that approximately two men have entered the address with weapons and assaulted the occupants, with a third male waiting outside for them in a vehicle.

One of the occupants, a woman in her 40s, has suffered serious head injuries as a result and is currently in hospital receiving treatment.

It is believed the men then left the address and got into a nearby white car before leaving the area.

Nothing has been reported as stolen at this time.

Officers investigating the incident are carrying out enquiries in the local area today.

Anyone with information who can help identify those responsible are asked to call 101 and quote 44200331960.

We would specifically like to hear from anyone who was driving through the area at this time who has dash cam footage, and residents who have private CCTV. Please get in touch.
