Officers have charged two teenagers following a serious assault in Barnfield Road, Southampton.

We were called at 12.40am on Tuesday, 27 October, by colleagues from the ambulance service to a report of a serious assault on Barnfield Road, Southampton.

A 56-year-old man suffered stab wounds to his neck and stomach following an altercation with two people. He was taken to Southampton General Hospital where he is being treated for serious, but non-life threatening injuries.

Officers have charged a 14-year-old boy from Southampton with attempted murder and another 14-year-old boy, also from Southampton, with possession of a knife in a public place.

Both boys have been remanded to appear at Southampton Youth Court this morning, Thursday, 29 October.

We continue to ask anyone who witnessed the incident or has any information, that has not yet spoken to us, to call us on 101 quoting Operation Tabloid or 44200416726. All calls will be dealt with in the strictest of confidence.

Alternatively people can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
