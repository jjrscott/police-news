We're appealing for witnesses following a garage burglary in Portchester.

It happened at a house in The Leaway sometime between 11.45pm Wednesday 23 October and 12.20am Thursday 24 October.

A young man returned home on his moped at around 11.45pm. He opened his garage door and found four men inside.

The men pinned him to the floor and stole his moped keys and another off road bike.

They rode them away from the vicinity of Cosham Train station towards Port Solent.

The men were wearing dark clothing with black balaclavas covering their faces. One of the men was wearing black and white Adidas shoes. Two of the men were in possession of kitchen knives.

The bikes are described as a white and blue moped, registration HK18 FCD and a white and blue Yamaha off road motorbike with no registration plate.

The bikes that were stolen are pictured.

If you witnessed this incident, have seen the bikes or been offered for sale any bikes matching these descriptions, please call us on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44190380607.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
