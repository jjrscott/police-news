Do you recognise the man pictured?

We know it's not the best quality image but you may recognise him from his build or his clothing.

We want to speak to him in connection with an incident where a member of the public was verbally abused in Festival Place, Basingstoke.

The 19 year old victim was outside Gourmet Burger Kitchen at 2.26pm on Monday, December 30.

He was approached by the suspect, who was unknown to him. The suspect shouted homophobic abuse at the victim before walking away with two other males.

Do you recognise the man in the red jacket? Did you witness the incident? If you have any information, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44190466550.

Alternatively, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
