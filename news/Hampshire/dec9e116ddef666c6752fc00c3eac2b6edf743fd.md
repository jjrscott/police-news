Can you help us identify this man?

We want to speak with him in connection with an attempted robbery in Eastleigh on Monday afternoon (June 1).

It was reported a man entered an office at the University of Southampton sports ground, on Wide Lane, before demanding the person inside hand over his belongings.

When the person inside told him he had nothing, the man left the building again.

Officers investigating the incident are keen to speak with the man in this CCTV image.

He is described as being white, in his mid 30s, around 5ft 10ins tall and of medium build, wearing a grey and blue Nike top.

If you recognise this man, or have any information that could assist our enquiries, please call 101, quoting the reference 44200195512.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
