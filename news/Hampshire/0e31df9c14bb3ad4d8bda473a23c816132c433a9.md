Detectives investigating the incidents on River Walk, Southampton on September 5 and the death of 20-year-old Sol Hemy, have arrested a man.

A 27-year-old man from Gosport has been arrested on suspicion of murder.

He remains in police custody at this time.

The arrest comes after we received reports of gun shots being heard in River Walk just after 1am on Thursday 5 September. Shortly after, an address on River Walk was found to be cultivating cannabis, and a vehicle left in Riverside Park was found to contain the a large amount of cannabis.

Just after 6.30am, the body of Sol Hemy was found in the water at Riverside Park. Sol was not shot, but his death remains unexplained. Officers investigating his death and the incident that happened on River Walk a few hours earlier, will question the 27-year-old man today as part of their enquiries.

Officers continue to urge anyone with information around the circumstances of Sol's death to call 101 and quote Operation Telly.
