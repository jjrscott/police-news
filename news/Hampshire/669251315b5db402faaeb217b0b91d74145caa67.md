We are appealing for witnesses following a road traffic collision in Churchill Way West, Basingstoke, which has sadly resulted in the death of a 34 year old man.

The incident took place at 5.37pm on May 19. A brown Honda moped was travelling Westbound on Churchill Way West when it was in collision with a grey Scania lorry, close to the Victory Roundabout.

The moped driver was taken to hospital with a serious head injury but has since died.

If anyone witnessed the collision or has dash cam footage, they should call 101 quoting Operation Chartered.
