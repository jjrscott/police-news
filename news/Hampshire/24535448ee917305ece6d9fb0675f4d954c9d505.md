A Southampton man has been jailed for 27 months after breaking in to two homes and damaging a CCTV camera at a police station.

Thomas Anthony Wellman forced entry to houses in Fairisle Road and Alderney Close, Southampton, took car keys and stole an Audi A3 and Volkswagen Beetle.

When the 23-year-old, of Mardale Road, Southampton, was arrested on March 13, he also caused damage to a CCTV camera in a cell at Southampton Central police station.

Appearing at Southampton Crown Court on Friday (May 15), Wellman was jailed for 27 months.

The court heard he had stolen the Audi A3 from Fairisle Road on February 24 around 2.15am.

Around 20 minutes later, he stole the Beetle from Alderney Close.

He pleaded guilty to two counts of burglary and one of criminal damage.

Speaking after the sentencing, DS Simon Price said: "These residential burglaries understandably caused much concern and distress for the occupants of both addresses.

"Wellman showed no regard for their property, and I hope this sentence serves as a warning.

"We take burglaries and vehicle thefts very seriously, as it has a considerable effect on those who find themselves victims of it."
