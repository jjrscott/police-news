We're appealing for witnesses following a road traffic incident in Beaulieu.

Officers were called to a collision between a car and a cyclist at 4.36pm on Monday 27 August on the B3054.

The cyclist was taken to Southampton General Hospital who suffered serious injuries, including a laceration to their knee.

Enquiries into how the accident occurred are ongoing, but we're also turning to the public for help.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you see what happened? Or maybe you have dashcam footage available.

Anyone with information is asked to call us on 101, quoting 4200328630.

Alternatively, you can phone Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
