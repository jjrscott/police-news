We are investigating the death of an 84 year old man who was found at an address in Manners Road on Friday morning (8 November).

The body is confirmed to be that of Anthony Ronald Berry of Manners Road.

Police have been conducting a number of enquiries and have subsequently arrested three people on suspicion of manslaughter.

They are two 15-year-olds and a 16-year-old, all from Portsmouth. All three have been released from custody but remain under investigation.

Our enquiries remain ongoing and officers would like to hear from anyone who knew Mr Berry, or has information about any suspicious activity in Manners Road that could assist our investigation.

Superintendent Steve Burridge, District Commander for Portsmouth, said: "At this time, we do believe this was an isolated incident. We are currently working to establish the full circumstances of the death.

"Local officers are focusing patrols in the area to reassure residents and are continuing to make enquiries, so if you live in the vicinity and have any concerns or any information, do not hesitate to speak to them. Or you can call 101, quoting Operation Satchel."
