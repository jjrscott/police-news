We're appealing for witnesses following a robbery at Central Stores on Botley Road, Romsey.

The incident happened between 5.10pm and 5.12pm on Saturday 7 December.

It was reported that a man wearing a black balaclava entered the store holding a claw hammer. He approached the cashier and demanded money from the safe. He led the cashier to the rear office and stole approximately Â£2700 from the safe.

During the incident, he threatened a customer with the hammer before leaving with the money.

The man is described as being white, approximately 5 feet 10 inches tall and well built. He was wearing a light grey tracksuit, dark trainers with large black heels. He also has a small mark or tattoo on the right side of his neck.

We are keen to speak to the owner or driver of a VW Golf that was parked near to the scene at the relevant time as they may have information that will assist our investigation.

We're you in the area around this time on Saturday 7 December? Did you witness anything suspicious? Do you know anyone with a small mark or tattoo on the right side of their neck?

If you can help please call 101, quoting 44190440460.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously
