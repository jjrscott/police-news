We are appealing for witnesses following an incident where an elderly man was threatened at knifepoint in Alton.

At 5.54pm on Thursday 9 July, an 81-year-old man was held up at knifepoint at the local cricket grounds in Four Marks.

He was approached by the suspect, who subsequently pulled out what the man believed to be a knife and threatened him. Nothing was taken from the gentleman during the encounter and he did not receive any injuries of any kind.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you see what happened? Or perhaps you have dash cam footage?

Anyone with any information about this incident is asked to get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200253438.

Alternatively, call the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
