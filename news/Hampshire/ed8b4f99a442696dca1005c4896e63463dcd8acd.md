Wesley Walters, age 32, of Rampart Road, Southampton, was sentenced yesterday (27 January) to 13 years in jail for robbery.

The sentence comes after Walters pleaded guilty to one count of robbery at Southampton Crown Court on Tuesday, 14 January.

Walters followed an 82-year-old man from a post office in St Mary's Street, back to his home address on Saturday 21 July 2018.

The man unlocked the front door to his flat and when inside, became aware of Walters standing in his hallway wearing a balaclava and holding a knife.

Walters threatened the man with the knife and demanded money. He assaulted the elderly man before taking cash from his back pocket.

The man received serious injuries during the incident, including a fracture to his right wrist and torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder. These injuries have left him with permanent limited movement in his right arm.

He also sustained extensive swelling and bruising to the right side of his body.

The sum of money stolen was Â£850.
