We are appealing for dashcam and CCTV footage in connection with a burglary in Andover.

Between 4.35pm and 5pm on 6 December, a house was broken into on Winchester Road.

Jewellery and a safe were stolen from inside.

This is a busy main road in Andover, and officers would like to hear from anyone along this road that has CCTV, or any motorists who passed through this road between the times stated who may have captured footage of the people responsible on dashcam.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44190439187.

Alternatively you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org
