A 17 year old boy who was accused of shooting another teenager, paralysing him from the waist down, has been found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent following a trial at Winchester Crown Court.

Following a two week trial, the jury decided the teenager was not guilty of attempted murder but came to a majority verdict that he was guilty of causing GBH with intent.

The 17 year old from Blackwater, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had denied both allegations.

The 17 year old was accused of shooting the teenager, who was 17 at the time but is now 19, at a garage block in Hearsey Gardens, Blackwater, on February 10, 2018.

Sentencing for the 17 year old will take place on November 15 at Bristol Crown Court.

The jury was unable to come to a verdict on a further two offences of assisting an offender against 51 year old Samantha Binfield from Blackwater and Glen Johnson, 43, of no fixed address.

A hearing has been set for Thursday, October 31, at Winchester Crown Court, to decide whether a re-trial will take place.
