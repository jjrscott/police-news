We are appealing for information after an altercation in Southsea on Sunday 4 August.

A number of men were involved in the incident, which took place outside The Portsmouth Foyer on Greetham Street at about 10.45pm.

Two of these men are known to have received hospital treatment for their injuries.

The incident is believed to have been motivated by racial and homophobic hatred and we are exploring this as part of our investigation.

We believe that members of the public recorded the incident on their mobile phones. If you have any footage or other information, please call 101 quoting 44190275165.

Alternatively you can call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.

Three people have been arrested and released as our investigations continue:

• 19-year-old man from Portsmouth

• 21-year-old man from Southampton

• 19-year-old man from Havant
