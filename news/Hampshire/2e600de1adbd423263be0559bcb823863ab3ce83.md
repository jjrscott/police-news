We are appealing for information after a fail to stop collision in Milton Road, Portsmouth, on Wednesday 2 October.

A cyclist was waiting in the right filter lane at the junction with Tangier Road at 7.15am.

A van travelling south over Copnor Bridge was in collision with the cyclist, a man in his 50s.

He sustained leg and arm injuries after he was thrown from his bike, which was badly damaged.

The driver of the van failed to stop at the scene.

The junction is very busy at that time of day and we are appealing for witnesses or dash cam footage.

If you have any information about this incident, please call 101 quoting 44190351308.

Alternatively you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
