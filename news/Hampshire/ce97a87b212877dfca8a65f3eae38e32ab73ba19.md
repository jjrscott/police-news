We are furthering our appeal for witnesses after a fatal collision on Downend Road, Fareham, this morning (25 June).

We were called at around 12.40am to reports of collision involving a Ford Fiesta that had left the carriageway.

A passenger, a 21-year-old woman from Fareham, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

The driver, a 22-year-old man from Paulsgrove, was taken to Queen Alexandra Hospital to be treated for his injuries. They are described as serious but not life threatening.

We are investigating the exact circumstances of the collision, and will today be making a number of enquiries in the area.

Officers investigating are keen to speak to the driver of a silver Ford Transit van who we believe was on the road at the time, and may have seen the Fiesta prior to the collision.

Inspector Andrew Tester, of the Roads Policing Unit, said: "We are grateful for the responses we have already received from our earlier appeal, but we would like to continue our appeal for witnesses to this tragic incident.

"From witnesses in the area, we believe a light coloured Ford Transit style van was behind the Fiesta on Downend Road before the collision.

"I am now making a direct appeal to the driver and any other occupants of that van to please make contact with the police.

"Whether you saw anything or not, it helps us build a picture of what happened leading up to the collision.

"If anyone has any information, or dash-cam footage, to please get in touch via 101 and quote the reference 44200230693."
