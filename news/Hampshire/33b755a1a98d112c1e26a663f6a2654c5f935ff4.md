We have charged a man following a burglary in Portsmouth on Tuesday night.

Abdul Ali, 30, of Milton Road, Portsmouth, has been charged with burglary following a break-in at the Stacey Centre on Tuesday evening (March 31).

Officers were called to the premises just after 7pm to reports of power tools being stolen from the centre.

Two men, a 23-year-old and a 39-year-old, both from Portsmouth, were arrested later that evening.

They have since been released from custody but remain under investigation while our enquiries continue.

Abdul Ali is due to appear at Portsmouth Magistrates Court today (April 2).
