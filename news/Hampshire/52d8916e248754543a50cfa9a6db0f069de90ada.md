Officers have seized hundreds of cannabis plants after carrying out two warrants in Farnborough.

Around 300 cannabis plants were seized by Rushmoor's Neighbourhood Policing Team after they were found at houses in Tile Barn Close and Abbey Way on Monday 1 February.

No arrests have been made and our enquiries are ongoing.

It follows a separate incident on Saturday 30 January, in which officers responding to a report of a burglary found around 150 plants in a flat in High Street, Aldershot.

Modifications had been made to the electrical supply and heating and lighting equipment were found.

An investigation is underway. No arrests have been made.

Inspector Kirsten Troman said: "This all forms part of our ongoing work to disrupt drugs supply in the Hart and Rushmoor districts.

"Some people may dismiss this as being just a bit of cannabis, but we want to stress that any production of drugs is linked to hidden harm. Large scale operations are often run by organised crime gangs. Those gangs are likely to engage in very serious violence involving weapons, such as firearms. They may also take advantage of vulnerable people, exploiting them or making them work in servitude.

"The electrical requirement to grow this many plants is also really dangerous and can be a huge fire risk, putting neighbouring properties, and lives in danger.

"It is not just a bit of cannabis, it's linked to serious criminality. That's why we are really keen to hear from people who suspect there is cannabis cultivation or drug related activity going on their neighbourhood.

"Every call you make to us is logged and helps us build up an intelligence picture about what might be happening in your community. This allows us to take action and prevent your neighbourhoods from harm."

If you can help, you can call 101 or go to www.hampshire.police.uk and report online.
