We are appealing for information after two men died in a collision near Corhampton.

A Ford Fiesta Zetec, an Indian FTR motorcycle and an MV Agusta motorcycle were involved in a collision at about 4.30pm on Sunday 2 February on the B3035 Corhampton Lane.

The rider of the Indian motorcycle, a man in his 50s, and the rider of the MV Agusta, a man in his 60s, died at the scene.

Their next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers.

The driver of the Ford Fiesta, a 17-year-old boy from West Meon, has been arrested on suspicion of:

 * Causing death by dangerous driving
 * Causing death by driving without due care and consideration while over the specified drug limit.

He remains in custody at this time.

Inspector Andy Tester, from the Roads Policing Unit, said:

"We are appealing for witnesses to this collision, which has resulted in the death of two men.

"If you were in the area yesterday evening and saw anything during or before this collision, please call us on 101 quoting 44200041761.

"You might have dash cam footage that would help our investigation."
