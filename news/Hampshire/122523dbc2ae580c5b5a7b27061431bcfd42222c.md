We are appealing for a potential witness to come forward as part of an investigation into a sexual assault in Ringwood.

The incident took place sometime between 9pm and 9.30pm on Thursday 19 September, on a footpath between Jubilee Close and Winston Way, Ringwood.

A 17-year-old girl was walking on the footpath when she was approached by a male she did not know.

He sexually assaulted her over her clothing. At this point, a member of public came forward and intervened, pushing the unknown male away, and the 17-year-old girl ran away.

The incident was later reported to the police.

Detective Constable James Pieri said: "An investigation is underway and we're following a number of lines of enquiry.

"We would particularly like to hear from the person who intervened during this incident.

"They may hold vital information about what happened and we would like to speak to them as a matter of urgency. If this is you, please call us.

"Officers will continue to make enquiries in the area - please speak to them if you have any concerns or information."

Anyone with information on what happened should call police on 101, quoting the crime reference number 44190335624.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
