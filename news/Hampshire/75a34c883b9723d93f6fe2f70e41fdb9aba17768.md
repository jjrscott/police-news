We're appealing for witnesses after an 11-year-old girl was sexually assaulted by a man in Chandlers Ford.

The incident took place in Fryern Recreation Ground, close to the play area, sometime between 8.10am and 8.30am on Monday, 22 March.

The girl was walking to school, through the recreation ground, when she saw a man sat on a bench between the basketball court and play area.

After the girl had walked past, the man approached her from behind and grabbed her upper thigh, over her clothing.

The girl ran off towards Highfield Road.

The man is described as:

• white
• aged between 30-50
• wearing a black coat and black shoes.

Detective Sergeant Will Whale said: "This incident happened in daylight at a busy time of day. We would like to hear from anyone who saw a man matching the above description in the Fryern Recreation Ground area of Chandlers Ford or anything suspicious at around that time.

"I would like to reassure the public that we continue to prioritise violence against women and girls and bring perpetrators of violent and sexual offences to justice.

"We have increased our patrols in the area. If you have any concerns please don't hesitate to speak to one of our officers.

"Anyone with any information about this incident should call 101 quoting 44210107929."

Please remain vigilant and if you see anything suspicious call us on 101. In an emergency, always dial 999.

Alternatively, people can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where information can be left anonymously.
