A burglar who assaulted his victim has been jailed.

On 13 February, a woman returned to her home on Porchester Heights, Fareham, and disturbed two burglars - one of whom was heavily pregnant at the time.

She was assaulted by the male burglar and then struck by the pair's vehicle as they drove off.

Computer equipment and jewellery were among the items taken. Items of the victim's jewellery were later recovered.

Benjamin Raymond Coates, aged 35, of Eagle Avenue, Waterlooville, pleaded guilty to assault causing actual bodily harm, burglary and driving whilst disqualified.

Coates was sentenced on 24 August at Portsmouth Crown Court to 30 months for burglary, six months for the assault and four months for the driving offence, to run concurrently. He was also disqualified from driving for 50 months.

Amy Cheeseman, aged 29, Hillfield Road, Chichester, pleaded not guilty to burglary, but was found guilty following a Crown Court trial.

She received an 18-month community order, 20 rehabilitation days and a six month curfew, and was ordered to pay Â£250 compensation to the victim.

Detective Sergeant Deborah Mason said:

"This was a very distressing incident for the victim, who sustained a broken shoulder blade.

"Thanks to the excellent work of the investigating team, the people responsible have been brought to justice.

"This will hopefully provide some comfort to the victim after her ordeal, as well as reassurance to the local community."
