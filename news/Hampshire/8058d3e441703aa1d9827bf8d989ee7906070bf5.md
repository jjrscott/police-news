We are appealing for information following two robberies in Eastleigh on Monday 26 October.

Between 3.55pm and 4.05pm three teenage boys threatened a second group in Eastleigh town centre, directly opposite KFC and stole a bike from a boy in the group.

The three teenagers then rode off towards The Point and turned left down Desborough Road.

Shortly afterwards, at around 4.45pm, a man had his bike taken from him at the Texaco Garage on Southampton Road.

We would like to speak to three boys in connection with both incidents.

The first is described as follows:

 * White
 * Aged between 16 and 18-years-old
 * Blonde hair
 * Between 5 feet 1 inch and 5 feet 4 inches
 * Slim build

The second is described as follows:

 * White
 * Aged between 15 and 17 years-old
 * Around 5 feet 5 inches
 * Slim build
 * Wearing a grey tracksuit and black 'man bag'

The third is described as follows:

 * White
 * Around 15-years-old
 * Around 5 feet 8 inches
 * Medium build
 * Wearing a dark jumper, blue face mask and black hat

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 with the reference 44200416210. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
