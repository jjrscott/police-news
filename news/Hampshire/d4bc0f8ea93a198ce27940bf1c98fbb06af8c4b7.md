We would like to appeal to public for information following an aggravated burglary at a home on Bonner's Field in Farnham on March 14 at 8.30pm.

It was reported four men with their faces covered entered the address, threatened the occupants, and stole a number of items of high value gold jewellery.

Some of the jewellery has been described as:

• Gold wedding ring, 22ct and inscribed with 'Baby'
• Gold wedding ring and inscribed 'Merin'
• Gold long flat chain, approx. 60g
• Gold chain with 'P' pendant

Images have also been provided of four of the necklaces stolen.

We would like to hear from anyone who has seen this gold jewellery recently, has been offered it, or know who it might have been sold on to.

Not only is the collection worth between £12,500 and £13,000, it has immense sentimental value to the family.

If you think you can help, please call on 101 and quote 44200097255.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and leave information anonymously.
