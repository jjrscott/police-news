Officers investigating a series of burglaries across Ringwood have arrested a man in connection with the incidents.

Properties in Swan Mead, Ashley Close, Westbury Road, Addison Square and Green Lane have been targeted since the beginning of November.

Specialist officers sighted a vehicle of interest which had been heavily linked to the recent burglaries - and after seeing the driver decamp the vehicle - officers made themselves known to the suspect and detained him.

A 27-year-old man from Dibden was arrested on suspicion of non-dwelling burglaries.

He was later release under investigation pending further enquires.
