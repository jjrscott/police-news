Officers investigating the theft of cash from an ATM in Sholing would like to appeal to the driver of a vehicle seen on Station Road just before the incident occurred.

At 1.52am on Wednesday 14 August, a small vehicle is seen on CCTV to be driving down Station Road, with Best One on its left. It then slowly turns right onto Cranbury Road.

At 1.55am, the cash machine next to Best One is believed to have exploded.

Officers are appealing directly to the driver of the small vehicle that turned right onto Cranbury Road.

Detective Constable Keith Evans from the Western Investigation Team said: "We are continuing to investigate the exact cause the damage to the cash machine and we are working with the Arson Task Force to achieve that.

"However, we are really keen to identify the person in the vehicle described. They would have been nearby just before the incident happened and may be able to help us identify those responsible."

"If this was you, please get in touch."
