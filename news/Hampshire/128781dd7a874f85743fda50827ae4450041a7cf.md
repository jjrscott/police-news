We are appealing for witnesses and information following a burglary in Aldershot.

We are particularly appealing to anyone who might have seen a man in a high visibility vest in Lower Farnham Road on the evening of Friday, January 17.

The burglary occurred between 4.50pm and 8.15pm on January 17. The suspect(s) broke into a property on Lower Farnham Road after smashing glass in a UPVC door.

A search of the premises was carried out but nothing is believed to have been stolen.

Were you in the area that evening, particularly around 7pm? Did you see anyone acting suspiciously or anyone in a high vis vest? If you can help or if you have dash cam footage, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200021020.
