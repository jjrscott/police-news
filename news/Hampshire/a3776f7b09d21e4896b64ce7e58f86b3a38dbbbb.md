## Man charged with county line supply to the Isle of Wight

A man from Surrey has been charged as part of a proactive investigation into a County Line being run from Surrey to the Isle of Wight.

On Monday 15 February, detectives investigating a county line running from Leatherhead to Newport, executed an early morning warrant in Fareham, as part of a wider operation looking into drugs supply.

The warrants were executed by officers from the Force's specialist department on county lines, Operation Monument, supported by officers from Surrey Police.

As result, Kieran Rainford, aged 37, from Cressall Close, Leatherhead, Surrey, has been charged with two counts of being concerned in the supply of crack cocaine and heroin.

He has been remanded in custody and is due to appear at Southampton Magistrates Court today (Tuesday 16 February).
