We are appealing for witnesses after a fatal collision on the A303 yesterday morning (28 January).

Officers were called at 7.33am to reports of a collision involving a black Volkswagen Scirocco and a white Volkswagen Luton Van on the westbound A303 near Shipton Bellinger.

The driver of the Scirocco, a 29-year-old man from Basingstoke, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. His family have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers.

Enquiries are being conducted into the exact cause of the collision, and we are keen to speak with any witnesses who may help our investigation.

Were you on the road at the time? Perhaps you have dash cam footage showing either vehicle prior to the collision?

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 with the reference 44210032680. Alternatively, you can phone Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
