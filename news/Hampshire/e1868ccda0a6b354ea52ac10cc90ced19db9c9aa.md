We're appealing for information following a robbery in Havant on Saturday evening (4 July).

Shortly before 7pm, a group of four teenage boys were walking from the town centre along Barncroft Way when they noticed two males following them.

The group walked up Purbrook Way until they reached Linkenholt Way, when one of the males approached a boy in the group, pushed him and demanded he hand over his earphones. The victim did so before running off to call police.

The three remaining boys continued up Rockbourne Close and cut across the grass to get to Hordle Road when they were approached again by the two males, who demanded one of the boys' phones.

The victim declined, and shortly after, on Hordle Road, one of the males tried to assault another boy in the group before stealing his mountain bike and making off in the direction of Park House Farm Way and ASDA.

A member of the public driving past stopped and spoke with the group of boys before driving after the males and retrieving the stolen headphones, which have been returned to the victim.

The mountain bike, which was not returned, is described as a dark blue Carrera, and at the time it was stolen it had a bag of groceries hanging from the handlebars.

One of the males was described as black, slim, aged between 16 and 20 years-old, around 6ft 2ins tall, and wearing a navy blue tracksuit with the hood up.

The second was described as white, fat, aged between 16 and 18 years-old, wearing a grey tracksuit with the hood up.

Do you know who these two people are? Do you recognise their descriptions? Did you see these two males in the areas mentioned on this evening, or did you witness any of these incidents taking place?

Have you seen anyone riding a bike matching this description, or found it discarded somewhere?

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44200245610.

Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111, or via their anonymous online form at crimestoppers-uk.org
