We're currently supporting our emergency service colleagues from the coastguard and fire service following a substantial cliff collapse at the southern end of Shanklin beach.

As a result of the collapse, access to the beach from Luccombe Bay is not safe for the public.

If you are out on your daily exercise please AVOID this area at all costs.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.
