A man was arrested last night after four emergency workers were assaulted in Portsmouth.

Officers were called just after 10pm by an ambulance crew who reported being assaulted by a man.

The crew had stopped in a layby near Anglesea Road.

One of the ambulance staff, a man, suffered a minor injury, the other three, a man and two women, were uninjured.

A 55-year-old man, from Portsmouth, was arrested on suspicion of four counts of assault by beating of an emergency worker.

He remains in custody at this time.
