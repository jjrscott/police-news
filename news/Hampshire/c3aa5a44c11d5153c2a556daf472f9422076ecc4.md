A man has been jailed for more than three years following an investigation into a burglary series in Hampshire.

Daniel Thornton, 36, of no fixed abode, appeared at Portsmouth Crown Court for sentence.

He had pleaded guilty to two counts of burglary, which took place in neighbouring properties in Gaylyn Way, Fareham on November 16, 2018. A watch and cash were stolen.

Thornton also pleaded guilty to two counts of handling stolen goods.

One count related to jewellery that had been stolen from a house in Gordon Road, Curdridge, sometime between November 10 and 11, 2018.

The other concerned property that had been stolen during a burglary in Lower Spinney, Warsash, sometime between March 20 and 21 this year.

Thornton admitted two house burglaries in Petersfield, and a handling stolen goods offence following a burglary in Fareham and them to be taken into consideration.

Today (Wednesday 25 September) at Portsmouth Crown Court, Thornton was sentenced to three years and nine months in prison.

The investigation was led by the Operation Hawk team at the Portsmouth Police Investigation Centre.

The court heard that officers found that Thornton had contacted online jewellery stores to exchange some of the goods he had stolen for cash.

Speaking after the hearing, police staff investigator Catherine Cole said: "Thornton's actions had a real negative impact on his victims, and I hope this result gives them some form of closure."
