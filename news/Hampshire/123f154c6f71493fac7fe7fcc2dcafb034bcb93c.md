Appeal to identify man after robbery at One Stop shop in Southampton

We are investigating after a man entered the One Stop shop on Butts Road on Sunday evening (Oct 27) and demanded money. He was carrying what has been described as a long barrelled rifle at the time.

The man managed to steal the metal till drawer and its contents, some £200.

No one was injured.

Armed response officers and a dog unit were deployed to the scene, however no one was located.

The man has been described as

• White
• Slim build
• Black jumper with hood up
• Black joggers with white, round logo or motif on the right thigh
• Black face covering
• Black and white Adidas trainers
• White socks

Having reviewed the store's CCTV, officers investigating the incident, which happened at 6.50pm on October 27, are hoping someone recognises the emblem seen on the man's right thigh of his black trousers or joggers.

Do you recognise this brand and do you know who might they belong to?

Where you in the area of Butts Road on Sunday evening just before 7pm and did you see anyone behaving suspiciously, or any suspicious vehicles in the area?

If you live nearby and have private CCTV, or where driving through and have dash cam footage, please call us on 101 and quote 44190385591.
