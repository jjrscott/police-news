Do you recognise the jewellery in these images? Have you seen them recently, or been offered them for sale?

If so, you may be able to help our investigation into a house burglary in Locks Heath.

It took place some time between 7.30pm and 11pm on Saturday 26 October in Northmore Road, Park Gate.

The house was broken in to while the homeowner was out and Â£50,000 worth of jewellery was stolen.

Among the items taken was 35 ear rings, 11 finger rings, 12 bangles, three bracelets, five 22 carat gold coins and biscuits, four pendants, six necklaces and two watches.

An investigation is underway and we have released images of some of the items that were stolen.

We are keen to hear from anyone who saw anything suspicious around the time of the burglary or in you have been offered any jewellery for sale.
