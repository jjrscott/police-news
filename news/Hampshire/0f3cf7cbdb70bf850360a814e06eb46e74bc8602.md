Can you help us identify this man? He was seen by members of the public masturbating in a public place in Totton.

The incident took place at approximately 6pm on Monday 13 July in the park behind Totton Library, where a man was caught masturbating on a park bench in the sight of a yoga class.

The male is described as white, approx. 5ft 10", aged between 50 and 60, of a slim build with grey hair. He was seeing wearing blue jeans and a grey short sleeved top with a black collar and black hemmed sleeves.
