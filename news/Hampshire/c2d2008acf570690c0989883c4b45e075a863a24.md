Officers are appealing for further information relating to a fail to stop collision in South Wonston on Sunday 23 June.

At around 11pm a vehicle, believed to have been travelling northbound, was involved in a serious collision with a pedestrian on Christmas Hill, opposite the junction with Connaught Road. The pedestrian, a 27-year-old man, sustained a broken leg and wrist.

The vehicle failed to stop at the scene.

We're looking to trace the driver of a Volkswagen Passat, registered from 2004 to 2011, that may have been involved in the collision.

PC Stephen Eadsforth, said: "We understand that you may be unaware that you were involved in the collision.

"Please cast your mind back to that date. If you believe that you were involved in a collision we would really like to hear from you; it could be that you thought you had hit a wild animal. We would urge you to come forward if you believe this to be you, as any information can help assist with our enquiries."

If you have any information relating to this incident, please contact police on 101, quoting 44190216853, or call the charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
