We are appealing for witnesses after a vehicle was set alight on Staplehurst Close, Southampton.

The fire was set to the white Ford Fiesta between 10pm and 10.30pm on Tuesday 17 November.

Enquiries have identified the vehicle, which we now know was stolen from Priory Road on the 28 October.

It is believed the car may have been driven around Bursledon prior to it being set alight on Staplehurst Close.

Officers investigating are keen to speak with anyone who may have seen the car since it was stolen, or who has any information into either the arson or the theft of the vehicle

Were you in the area at the time? Perhaps you have dash-cam footage of the car?

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 with the reference 44200446992. Alternatively, you can phone Crimestoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
