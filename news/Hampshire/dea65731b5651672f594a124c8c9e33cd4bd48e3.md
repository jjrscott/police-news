Today his family have paid tribute to him.

In a statement, they said: "Around midnight on the evening of Monday 16 December, our dearly loved son Harry Turner was involved in a fatal car accident.

"His death has left the whole family utterly heartbroken and we cannot find the words to express the pain we feel.

"Anyone that knew Harry will remember his caring, compassionate personality and his unique sense of humour.

"Our shining star will be deeply missed by all of those who knew him.

"Harry will forever have a place in our hearts and his memory will live on through us all, as a beloved son, brother, proud uncle and friend.

"We'd like to say thank you for the love and support we have received from those close to us, but, at this early, we kindly request we are allowed to grieve in private during this difficult time."

Investigations into the exact circumstances of the collision are ongoing.
