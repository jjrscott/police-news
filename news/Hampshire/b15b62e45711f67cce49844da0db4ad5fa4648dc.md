A 52-year-old woman from Winchester has been reported for summons in relation to a fixed penalty notice after her son breached Covid-19 regulations.

This comes after patrolling officers stopped three boys on Woolford Close, at around 9pm on 27 January.

After a search a 14-year-old boy, and a 15-year-old boy were found in possession of cannabis.

The 14-year-old had been dealt with the night previously for a public order offence and his parents warned about Covid-19 breaches.

His mum has now been reported for summons after her son was caught breaching restrictions two nights in a row.

He is being dealt with voluntarily for the public order offence, and for possession of cannabis along with the other boy.
