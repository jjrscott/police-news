We have charged a fourth person in connection with an incident that happened on River Walk in Southampton on 5 September 2019.

Just after 1am, it was reported that gun shots were heard in the street and a large amount of cannabis was found at an address and in a nearby vehicle, abandoned in Riverside Park.

As a result three men were charged last week with conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary and conspiracy to possess a firearm, plus being concerned in the supply of class A drugs.

Today (January 28) we have charged a 17-year-old boy from Southampton with conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary and conspiracy to possess a firearm.

He appeared at Southampton Magistrates Court today. He will next appear at Southampton Crown Court on Feb 7.

The investigation into the death of 20-year-old Sol Hemy (Operation Telly) continues. Sol's body was found in the water at Riverside Park a few hours after the incident on River Walk.

Enquiries are ongoing.
