We are appealing for witnesses following a collision between a BMW and pedestrian in Southampton last night (December 16).

Officers were called to Town Quay just before 10.40pm.

The pedestrian, a 47-year-old man from Sway, has sadly been pronounced dead. His next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers.

The driver of the BMW X5, a 39-year-old man from Southampton, has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by careless driving.

Investigations into the exact circumstances of the collision are ongoing and we are keen to speak with any witnesses.

Were you in the Town Quay area between 10.30pm and 10.40pm last night? Maybe you have a dashcam in your car that captured footage of a BMW X5 in the area?

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44190452028. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
