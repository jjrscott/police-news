Can you help us identify this man?

We are keen to speak to him in relation to recording device being fitted to an ATM at the former Natwest branch on Mengham Road in Hayling Island yesterday afternoon (December 6).

Officers have seized the device and investigations are ongoing.

However, they would like to speak to anyone who may have used this ATM from 3pm onwards yesterday.

PC Stuart Grover, of the Hayling Island Neighbourhood Policing team, said: "I appreciate this CCTV image is somewhat blurry, but we are keen to speak to this man in relation to a device being fitted to the ATM on Mengham Road.

"He has quite a distinctive blue puffer jacket and is wearing light blue jeans. Anyone who recognises the clothing, or who saw this man in Hayling Island yesterday should contact us.

"I would also like to encourage anyone who withdrew cash or used the ATM yesterday to check their accounts to ensure no transactions have occurred that you are unaware of.

"Anyone with concerns or who recognises the man in the picture should call 101, quoting 44190439123. Alternatively, if you wish to make an anonymous report, then call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
