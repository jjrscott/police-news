Officers in Southampton are issuing crime prevention advice after we received 10 reports of thefts from motor vehicles in the city.

Items have been taken from vehicles in locations including:

 * Derby Road
 * Queensway
 * Alfred Street
 * Lodge Road
 * Alma Road
 * Winton Street
 * Cambridge Road
 * Devonshire Road
 * Coleman Street
 * Union Road

The majority have taken place overnight between Saturday, 6 March and this morning, Tuesday, 9 March and in many cases small items such as loose change, sunglasses and ID documents have been taken.

Two Toyota Auris cars had catalytic converters stolen in Alma Road and Winton Street.

An Audi A3 and a Volkswagen Jetta had their number plates taken whilst parked in Coleman Street and Union Road.

We are encouraging anyone who has been affected to report it to us, so we can build up a bigger picture of the areas being targeted and when.

In addition, if you witnessed anyone acting suspiciously in these areas between these dates, or have CCTV covering these areas that may have caught something, please call 101 and quote 44210087438.

Some of the vehicles involved had been left unlocked. We take this opportunity to remind motorists to make sure you remove valuables from your vehicle and lock it.

It is also worth checking that any security lights you may have work, and if you have CCTV make sure it is functioning.
