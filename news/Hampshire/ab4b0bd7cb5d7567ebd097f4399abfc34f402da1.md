Tribute has been paid to a motorcyclist who died following a collision the A32 last month.

Jack Burgess, 22, of Hillside Close, Waterlooville, was involved in a collision with three other vehicles on June 29.

He died in hospital the next day.

Today his family have paid tribute to him. They said: "Jack was a funny, adventurous and caring person who was loved by all that knew him.

"He is sorely missed but will live on in our memories and in those to whom he selflessly donated his organs."

Investigations into the exact circumstance of the collision, which happened on the A32 at Warnford, just before 7pm, are ongoing.

The collision involved a black Vauxhall Zafira, a grey Audi A6, a large articulated white truck and Mr Burgess' motorcycle.

The driver of the truck, a 49-year-old man, from Horndean, was arrested. He has been released from custody but remains under investigation.
