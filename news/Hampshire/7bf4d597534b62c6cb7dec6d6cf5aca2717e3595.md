Do you recognise this man?

We would like to speak to him in connection with a theft from a shop in New Milton.

Between 2.35pm and 2.45pm on Tuesday 19 January, a man entered Superdrug on Station Road and began browsing the skin-care items.

When the aisle was empty of other customers, the man selected a number of Olay items and concealed them in a bag before leaving the shop without paying.

The man is described as being around 5ft 10ins tall and was wearing a green coat and beige shoes. He was carrying a backpack and a white bag for life.

Do you recognise him?

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101, quoting 44210022701.
