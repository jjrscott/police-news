We know the majority of them are wearing face masks but do you recognise these people? We would like to speak to them in connection with a robbery at Festival Place in Basingstoke.

You may recognise their build, their clothing or you may recognise them as part of a group who know one another.

The incident occurred on the afternoon of August 24. Three 15 year old boys were approached by a group of four males who followed them through the shopping centre and then intimidated them to steal property including a Gucci belt, Armani bag, a Hugo Boss bag, True Religion ban and cash.

If you recognise any of the males in the CCTV images, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200325750. Alternatively, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
