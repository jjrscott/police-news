We are issuing an E-fit of a man we wish to speak to in connection with a robbery in Fleet that happened in January.

The victim, a 33 year old man from Fleet, was walking from the train station at around 2.30am on January 24, when he was approached by three men who got out of a dark coloured Audi in Elvetham Road. One of the suspects was holding a knife.

They made off in the Audi in the direction of Reading Road North after taking two iPhones, a laptop, Bose headphones and a black Tommy Hilfiger jacket.

Do you recognise the man pictured? If you can help, please get in touch by calling 101 and quoting reference 44200029002.

Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
