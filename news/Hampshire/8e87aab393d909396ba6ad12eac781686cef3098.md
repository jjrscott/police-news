We're appealing for witnesses, or anyone with information, to come forward following a burglary at a store in Southampton.

The incident happened sometime between 2.20am and 5am Thursday, 28 January at Poundstretcher in Bitterne Precinct.

At around 2.20am, a safe was stolen from the store's office and taken to Peartree Gardens car park. It was left there for around two hours before being picked up and attached to a car with ratchet straps.

The car then drove off with the safe trailing behind. Officers believe at some point the safe came off and had to be put back on.

The safe was later located on Freemantle Common Road.

Officers have been carrying out a number of enquiries but we're now turning to the public for help.

Were you in the area at the time? Did you see a car in the Bitterne area dragging a safe behind? Perhaps you were driving in the area and have dash-cam footage? Did you see anyone carrying or concealing a safe?

Anyone with information is asked to call 101, quoting 44210032606.

Alternatively you can contact independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
