Detectives from Hampshire Constabulary's Operation Marmion team have charged a man with non-recent sex offences against children.

The offences relate to 11 children, who were under the age of 16, during Burgess's time as a choirmaster for All Saints Choir in Portsmouth and Westbourne Choir in Sussex between 1976 and 2009

Mr Burgess was bailed to appear at Portsmouth Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 3 March.
