The family of a man who sadly died following a collision in Portsmouth on Tuesday (February 5) have today paid tribute to him.

We were called to a collision involving a motorcycle and bicycle on Portsdown Hill Road at 8.35pm.

The cyclist, Brett Michael Thorne, 39, of Fareham, was taken to hospital, but he has now been pronounced dead.

His mother has now paid tribute to him.

In a statement, she said: "My darling son, I love you so much. I'm absolutely devastated, you'll always be in my heart.

"You shouldn't have gone the way you did and so young.

"All your family - mum Susan, brothers Darren and Paul, nan Rose, aunties Carol, Chris and Lisa, stepfather Ian and Ginete - all miss you so much and are broken-hearted.

"Love you so much my darling boy, always thinking of you. We were with you until the end. Mum."

Enquiries are ongoing into the exact circumstances of the collision.
