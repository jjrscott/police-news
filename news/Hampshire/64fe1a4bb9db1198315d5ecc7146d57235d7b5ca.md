Officers are appealing for information after a group of people were involved in a fight in Southampton.

At some time between 2am and 2.50am during the early hours of Sunday, 28 July an altercation occurred between a large group of people behind the nightclubs on Vernon Walk, Bedford Place.

Detective Constable Marzena Szyndler, said: "We're appealing for information to help us establish what happened in the lead up to, during, and after the incident. Were you in the Vernon Walk area of Bedford Place during the early hours of this morning? Did you witness this incident? Did you see anyone running from the area?"

Three men were arrested on suspicion of wounding with intent; two 19-year-olds from Southampton and a 24-year-old from London.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Hampshire Constabulary on 101 quoting 44190264818.
