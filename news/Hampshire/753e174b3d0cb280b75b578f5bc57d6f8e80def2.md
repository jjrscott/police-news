We are appealing for witnesses after a fatal collision in Andover.

We were called at 2.27am today, 22 December, to reports of a body being found between the on and slip on the A303, at Picket Twenty.

Officers investigating believe that a large goods vehicle was in collision with a pedestrian, and did not stop.

Despite best efforts of the emergency services, a 53-year-old man from Andover was pronounced dead at the scene.

His next of kin have been informed.

We are investigating the exact circumstances of this collision and are keen to hear from anyone who saw what happened, or anyone with dash-cam footage that may assist our investigation.

Do you have footage of a pedestrian on the A303 this morning? Perhaps you saw a large goods vehicle on the road around the relevant time?

Anyone with information is asked to phone 101 quoting reference 128 of today's date.
