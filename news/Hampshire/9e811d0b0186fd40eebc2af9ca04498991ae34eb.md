You might remember that just before the New Year we appealed for information after three teenage boys were robbed on Sandhill Lane within Alver Valley Country Park, Lee-on-the-Solent.

Officers have now made three arrests as part of this investigation.

A 17-year-old boy, a 15-year-old boy, and an 18-year-old man, all from Gosport, were arrested on suspicion of robbery.

They have been released from custody but remain under investigation as our enquiries continue.

We continue to encourage anyone with information to call 101 quoting 44190464891, or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
