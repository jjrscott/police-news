The family of Lisa Massey, who died following a collision on the M27 on Good Friday, have paid the following tribute to her

'She was one of a kind and was loved by everyone who knew her. She radiated love and life wherever she went and will be greatly missed as a mother, a daughter, a sister and a friend. She was a beautiful soul and she will remain that way in the hearts of all who knew her.'

The collision occurred between junction3 and junction 2 of the westbound carriageway of the M27. Lisa, who is from Bournemouth, was a pedestrian at the time of the collision with a lorry.
