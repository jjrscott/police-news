Officers in Basingstoke will be able to stop and search anyone in the area of the town centre on Friday 25 October after Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 has been authorised.

This power has been implemented following a number of knife point robberies that have happened in the area over the last seven days.

There have been four reports of robberies involving knives that have occurred on Cowdery Heights, Festival Place, Wote Street and Victory Park.

Section 60 can be implemented in areas where either serious violence has occurred or police believe serious violence is about to occur and gives officers the power to stop and search anyone in a designated location, looking for offensive weapons or bladed articles.

Section 60 is an enhanced power that means we can stop and search anyone within the defined area on the map between the times given without the 'reasonable grounds' required in a normal stop and search.

The power has been implemented between 6pm tonight (October 25) and 1am tomorrow (October 26)

We are telling you because we follow the national Best Use of Stop and Search guidance to inform communities why you may see an increased police presence and when we have enhanced powers.

We know that some will think this inhibits our ability to catch offenders, however it is important communities are informed we are taking action. It is also helps prevent other incidents of serious violence occurring and so helps us prevent crime.

Tackling offenders is important to us, but we want them to prevent them from offending to begin with.

Section 60 is an emergency tactic. We do not suggest that it is a long term solution to knife related crime, however we have received concerns raised by the community and this is our response.
