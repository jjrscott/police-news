We are investigating a report of a rape of a 31-year-old woman which happened this afternoon in Winchester (July 19).

Police were called just before 1pm following the incident, which happened in a wooded area behind Ivy Close and Honeysuckle Close, Badger Farm.

Since then, officers have been carrying out a search and making enquiries in the area, and you will continue to see a police presence.

The woman is being supported by specialist officers.

Detective Inspector Emma Crute said: "We want to appeal to anyone who may have been in the woodland behind Ivy Close and Honeysuckle Close, or who has driven in the nearby area, and believes they have seen anyone suspicious.

"The man is believed to have a northern accent and we want anyone who was in this area this morning, through to around 1pm, to cast their mind back or check any dash cam footage you may have.

"You may have important information that could be vital to our investigation. If you saw anything that looked suspicious or out of the ordinary, please contact us.

"Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the reference 44200268860, or approach any of our officers who are out making enquiries in the area."
