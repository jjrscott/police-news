We would like to speak to the man pictured in an E-fit image, in connection with an incident where a 12 year old girl was approached in Fareham.

The incident occurred between 3.30pm and 3.45pm on Thursday, August 8 in the vicinity of Fareham Leisure Centre grounds.

The girl was walking with her dog in Leigh Road and approaching the junction with Arundel Drive when she was passed by a silver car which parked up. The male driver got out of the car and grabbed the girl, telling her to get in the car.

She managed to get away from him and ran away.

The man is described as being a white male, bald with heavy stubble and wearing dark rimmed glasses. His build is described as being skinny, white, around 5'9" tall, aged between 40 and 45 years old. He was wearing a pink or red long sleeved casual shirt, blue jeans and trainers.

Neighbourhood Sergeant Lee Paddick said: "While this appears to be an isolated incident, we would always remind people to be vigilant. Officers will be carrying out extra patrols in the area."

Were you in the area at the time? Did you see anything or anyone acting suspiciously?

Do you recognise the man in the E-Fit picture? If you can help, please call 101, quoting reference 44190280519.
