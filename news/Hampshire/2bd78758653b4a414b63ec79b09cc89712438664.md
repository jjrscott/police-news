Updated News Post

We're appealing for witnesses after a teenager was stabbed in Portsmouth last night.

A 16-year-old boy and his 18-year-old friend were attacked by a group of boys as they walked through a car park on Nelson Road, at around 9.40pm.

The 16-year-old was stabbed several times in the leg and arm before the group run off.

One of the group then returned to steal his wallet.

The teenager suffered serious injuries but they are not life-threatening.

His 18-year-old friend was able to ran away uninjured.

Did you see a group of boys hanging around the area last night? Did you see what happened?

Officers have arrested three people as part of this investigation.

Two 16-year-old boys and a 17-year-old boy have been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder, conspiracy to commit robbery and conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm.

They remain in custody at this time.

Anyone with information is asked to call us on 101, quoting 44190287307, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
