Officers investigating a number of offences in Paulsgrove over the weekend have issued a dispersal order which will be in place until Tuesday 17 November.

This action comes in response to a series of incidents involving a small group of people on Saturday 14 November.

Officers were called to the Danny Mart store on Ludlow Road just before 7pm, where a man had assaulted a staff member and caused around Â£500 worth of criminal damage to the till.

While officers were attending this incident, it was reported to them that a 15-year-old girl had been sexually assaulted between 6 and 7pm at the Premier Store on Allaway Avenue.

Officers also responded to four reports of assault and a further report of criminal damage at a residential address shortly afterwards.

The Section 35 dispersal order will be in place in the outlined areas until 8.45am on Tuesday initially.

Police officers and PCSOs can disperse people found within these areas who are contributing or are likely to contribute to causing other members of the public harassment, alarm or distress and crime and disorder.

Enquiries are ongoing.

Anyone with information regarding either of these incidents should call 101 quoting the reference 44200442157. Alternatively, call CrimeStoppers 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111.
