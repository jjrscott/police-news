A man has been jailed for a total of 35 months for a range of offences in Swanmore and Eastleigh.

Josh Barnes, aged 26 and of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty at Southampton Crown Court to breaching a non-molestation order, a burglary, and a theft - all of which occurred between 10 and 11 December 2020.

The court heard how Barnes had carried out a burglary at an address on Dodds Lane, Swanmore, on 11 December, during which items including jewellery, cash, electrical items, and a coat were stolen. These items were later recovered at an address known to be used by Barnes, who was wearing the stolen coat when he was arrested.

On the same day, Barnes stole various items from an address he had been staying in on Twyford Road in Eastleigh. Most of the items, including crossbow bolts and clothes, were recovered by police.

Josh Barnes was sentenced at Southampton Crown Court on Monday (15 March) to two years and nine months in jail, and will have to pay a victim surcharge of Â£190.

He was also sentenced for breaching a non-molestation order on 10 December 2020.
