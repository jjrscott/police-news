We are appealing for witnesses after a 26-year-old man suffered life threatening injuries after a collision involving two vehicles in Winchester yesterday (January 15).

The collision, involving a Peugeot 206 and Volvo articulated lorry, happened at the crossroad junction of Longwood Road and Lane End Road around 2.40pm.

Three passengers in the Peugeot suffered injuries.

The 26-year-old man suffered life-threatening injuries and has been taken to Southampton General Hospital. A 24-year-old man suffered serious injuries and a 22-year-old man suffered minor injuries.

Officers are investigating the exact circumstances of the collision.

They are keen to speak with anyone who may have witnessed the collision? Were you driving on either Longwood Road or Lane End Road, close to the junction, and have a dash cam in your car that captured footage of the collision?

Anyone with information can call 101, quoting 44200018059. Alternatively, you can call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
