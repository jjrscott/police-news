The family of a man who died in a collision on the A34 on Monday 11 November have released a tribute.

Police were called to the southbound carriageway at Bullington Cross, approximately half a mile from Sutton Scotney services, after a collision involving a silver Toyota Corolla and a lorry occurred between 8.10pm and 8.15pm.

Ric Mboma, aged 60 years, of Bridlepath Way in Feltham, London, was driving the Toyota and was pronounced dead at the scene.

The passengers in the vehicle, a boy and girl aged in their teens, sustained serious but not life-threatening injuries.

The lorry driver was uninjured.

Mr Mboma's family have released the following tribute:

"Ric Mboma was a loving and caring husband, and wherever a beautiful soul has been there is a trail of beautiful memories."

Anyone who witnessed this collision or has any information that could assist our investigation is asked to contact police on 101, quoting Operation Mention.
