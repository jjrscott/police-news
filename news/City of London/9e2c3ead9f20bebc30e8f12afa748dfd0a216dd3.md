This information is for the benefit of victims of crime who have been contacted by the City of London Police to take part in a survey, namely the Victim Satisfaction Survey.

**Why do we survey victims?**

The City of London Polce are committed to gaining input from you via feedback/surveys to help us understand the needs of the public and whether we are meeting their expectations as well as providing a measurement for police performance within the Policing Plan.

Asking victims about the service they received means we can find ways of improving the service that we provide and adapting our approach to suit the needs of the community.

**How do we decide whom to contact?**

All victims of crime may be contacted however exclusions may apply for various reasons such as if the incident was of a sensitive or serious nature, is under the age of 16 etc. The intention is to invite all eligible participants to maximise responses.

**How do we contact victims?**

Invites to participate will be sent to mobile phone numbers provided by the victim during initial contact with police.

The satisfaction monitoring will be conducted by way of Short Message Service (SMS) victim satisfaction survey.

A text will be sent inviting the person to participate and if they respond then a number of questions will be sent in sequence as individual messages.

**Who conducts the survey?**

The City of London Police employ an independent approved research company to act on our behalf (Esendex Limited). We are confident in allowing them to contact victims for us. The survey company operates under strict controls of confidentiality and all data is used for the purposes of our research only.

The information passed to the survey company is the minimum required to conduct the surveys; this data can only be used by the company for the purpose of conducting surveys and any future re-use is not permitted.

The survey is free of charge.
