Officers from the City of London Police are asking for the public's help in identifying a number of men believed to have information that could assist their investigation into violent disorder that occurred at Madison rooftop bar, EC4, on Saturday 11 July 2020.

Eight arrests were made on the night but officers are keen to identify and speak to a further three people pictured in CCTV images released today (Thursday 23 July 2020).

A number of people were injured at the rooftop bar, located in One New Change shopping centre, when a fight broke out at around 23.00hrs between two large groups and tables, chairs, and glass bottles were thrown. Two men were hospitalised - one with a broken jaw and the other, a bleed on the brain.

Anyone with information should call the City of London Police on 0207 601 2999 quoting reference 20*355541. Alternatively, you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, via their website or by calling 0800 555 111.
