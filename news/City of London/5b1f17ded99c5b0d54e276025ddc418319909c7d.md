This festive season 2020, the City of London Police and the Cheapside Business Alliance are inviting you to bring a little more Christmas cheer into the lives of children across the City with the launch of the City of London Police Charity for Children Christmas Appeal.

The City of London Police Charity for Children (Registered Charity No. 294362) is run for the benefit of children and young people; relieving sickness, crisis, disadvantage and disability. Established in 1972, the charity provides funds for individual kids and groups, enabling them to access the following support:-

 * Specialist equipment - for learning (computers, toys) or for around the home (adapted furniture).
 * Activity courses - to help improve social and communication skills or provide respite breaks for those who would otherwise not be able to get away.
 * Play areas - providing equipment for disabled children, enabling them to enjoy activities they otherwise would not be able to enjoy.
 * Schools - upgrading computers or purchasing specialist equipment.

Thank you taking the time to read this page and **all donations are appreciated.**
