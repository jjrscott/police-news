We continue to clampdown on cycle theft across the City and we've had a number of successes, resulting in the seizure of several stolen bicycles. While we have been able to return some of the bikes we've seized to their owners, we still have several outstanding bikes that we're keen to return. Please see below the galleries of the bikes and e-scooters we've seized.

If you think one of these is yours, **please email us** and provide as much of the information as possible listed in the email.

Once you have submitted your email to us, we will review it and notify you of the outcome. If we believe the bike or e-scooter is yours, we will make arrangements with you to return it. In some cases, we may require more information and will inform you of this.
