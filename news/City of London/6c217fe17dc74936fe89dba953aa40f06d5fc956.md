A significant 'cannabis factory' of 826 plants has been dismantled and destroyed by officers from the City of London Police.

The initial discovery was made on the afternoon of Wednesday 13 January, following reports of a strong smell of cannabis, and a warrant was obtained to enter the premises on Thursday 14 January.

 **Temporary Detective Inspector Andy Spooner, who is leading the investigation, said:**

"This is the first cannabis factory in the City, no doubt being set up in response to fewer people being out and about during the pandemic who might have noticed any unusual activity. However, this demonstrates that City of London Police continues to actively police the Square Mile, bearing down on any crime committed here.

"We have made two arrests and our enquiries continue."
