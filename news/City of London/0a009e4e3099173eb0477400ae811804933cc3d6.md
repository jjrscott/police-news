A habitual thief who has amassed over 100 convictions has been sentenced for a total of 36 months for his most recent crimes.

Paul Roy Kennedy, 63, of Boone Street, Lewisham, was jailed on Tuesday 16 June 2020 at Isleworth Crown Court for five handbag thefts and a number of fraud offences, after he used the victim's bankcards for numerous transactions.
Kennedy would regularly prey on tourists around popular attractions such as St Pauls Cathedral and the Tower of London, and pick their pockets for cash, bags and wallets.

Following three thefts in the Square Mile on 10 January 2020, 28 January 2020 and 1 February 2020, officers from the City of London Police recognised Kennedy from CCTV footage and quickly arrested him at his partner's property.

Due to his repeat offending, at the sentencing the City of London Police applied for a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) against Kennedy which would ban him from entering the Square Mile and put conditions on his behaviour for up to 10 years.

The judge remarked that a CBO was definitely needed to protect the public and was very much in support of the order, however, court will resume in September to formalise the details of the conditions.
