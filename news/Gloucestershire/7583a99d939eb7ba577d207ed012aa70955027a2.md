Officers are appealing for witnesses after numerous vehicles were damaged in an incident in the Tredworth area of Gloucester earlier this afternoon.

Shortly before 1.30pm today (Friday 20 December), Police attempted to stop a white Range Rover linked to a theft investigation.

The vehicle failed to stop for officers after causing damage to a number of vehicles including two police cars and a pursuit ensued.

After a search in the area, the vehicle was subsequently found abandoned on Bathurst Road and has now been seized.

The driver has not yet been located and enquiries are ongoing to find them.

Anyone who witnessed what happened or has relevant dashcam footage is asked to call police on 101 and reference incident 166 of 20 December.

Officers would also like to hear from anyone whose car was damaged in this incident.
