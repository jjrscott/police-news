Three women were arrested this morning (Monday 14 December) as part of Operation Kracker which aims to tackle shoplifting, theft and ASB as Christmas approaches.

The women who are from Cheltenham and aged, 23, 30 and 33 were arrested on suspicion of shoplifting and remain in police custody at this time.

The arrests follow intelligence that was gathered after a number of recent incidents of shoplifting in Cheltenham and Tewkesbury.

A large quantity of items were seized during the arrests and enquiries into identifying where they were stolen from continue.

Sergeant Julia Martin-Jones said: "It is believed that these women have been involved in between 15 and 20 incidents of shoplifting recently so ensuring that they were arrested was a priority for the Cheltenham and Tewkesbury Neighbourhood Policing teams.

"We will now be working to gather and secure the evidence that is needed to hopefully bring charges against them."
