A man has died following a two-vehicle collision in Lydney yesterday afternoon, 25 March and police are appealing for witnesses.

Police were called at 12.20pm with a report of a grey citeon C3 colliding with a silver Vauxhall Zafira on Lydney Highstreet.

Emergency services attended and a 73-year-old man from Lydney was pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin and the coroner have been informed.

Officers investigating the collision are keen to hear from anyone who may have relevant dashcam footage or who witnessed the incident and have not yet spoken to police.
