A man who deliberately coughed in the face of a paramedic during an incident in Stroud last month has been jailed.

Jonathan Brunsdon, 43, of Mason Road, Stroud was arrested following the incident on 28 March during which he made threats to infect the emergency worker with COVID19.

He initially denied the offence but when he appeared at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court yesterday (by video link) he changed his plea to guilty.

He has been sentenced to 20 weeks in prison and ordered to pay Â£100 compensation to the paramedic.

PC Russ Burgess, the investigating officer in this case, said: "This was a deliberate assault on an emergency worker who was carrying out his duty during a particularly stressful time.

"We will take robust action against anyone who is found to be behaving in this way and I am pleased that the court has supported our action and given this sentence."
