Officers are appealing for the public's help to identify a burglar who may have sustained facial injuries following an incident in Quedgeley.

At approximately 1.30am yesterday, Monday 17 February, an offender entered a home on a road off The Holly Grove.

The offender is described as being a man, around 6ft tall with facial hair. He was wearing dark clothing, grey shoes and a beanie hat.

He searched the property and it is not yet known whether anything was stolen.

An occupant within the property tried to detain the man and hit him in the face, the man then fled the address. It is believed the man will likely have facial injuries and police are appealing for any information which could help to identify him.

Anyone with information, or who saw anything suspicious in the area which could help the investigation, is asked to call police on 101 and quote incident 18 of 17 February.

Information can also be given anonymously to Crimestoppers by calling 0800 555 111.
