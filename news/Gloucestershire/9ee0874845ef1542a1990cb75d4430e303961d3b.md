Officers are appealing for witnesses as a man sustained serious injuries after being involved in a collision with a car towing a trailer in Fairford.

It was reported that a man was cycling along Roman Road at around 12.30pm yesterday (Wednesday 22 April) when he was overtaken by a Range Rover type vehicle towing a trailer.

The trailer struck the cyclist causing him to fall from his bike and sustain a serious head injury.

The cyclist, a man from the local area, was taken to Swindon Hospital where he remains in a stable condition.

The driver of the vehicle did not stop and anyone who may have witnessed the incident is asked to contact police and quote incident 511 of 22 April.
