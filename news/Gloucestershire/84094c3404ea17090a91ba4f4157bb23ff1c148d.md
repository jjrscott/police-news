Police are appealing for witnesses following the theft of a Land Rover Defender and a number of items from a property in St Briavels earlier this month.

The green car, registration ending M532 YRN, was taken from a farm between 5pm on Sunday 1 November and 7am on Monday 2 November.

Officers believe the thieves were able to gain access to two barns at the property. They also took golf clubs, electric caddy and charger, steam cleaner, two chainsaws, a drill, a combi chainsaw and hedge strimmer and a quantity of diesel.

It is being linked to similar thefts that have taken place in Gwent at around the same time.
