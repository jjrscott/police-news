Officers have issued CCTV images of two people they would like to speak to in connection with a theft at a model railway shop in Bourton-on-the-Water.

It was reported that the Bourton Model Railways store was targeted by unknown offenders at approximately 3.15pm on Tuesday 3 March with two model railway engines and a pack of coaches costing the store £595 being stolen.

The stolen items are as follows: a Bachman 31 - 519 (Class 158 766 2 car DMU GWR) worth £230, a Bachman 31 - 517 (Class 158 849 2 car DMU BR Reginal railways) worth £230 and a Graham Farish three coach set worth £135.

The man and woman pictured are believed to be from the West Midlands area and may have been travelling in a silver Peugeot.

It is believed that unknown offenders have targeted multiple model shops, including those in other counties, before stealing high value items and officers are asking model shop owners and traders to remain extra vigilant to this type of crime.

Investigating officers want to speak to the two people pictured as they may have information which could help with the investigation.

Anyone who recognises them is asked to call police on 101 and quote incident number 109 of 8 March, information can also be given anonymously to independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers by calling 0800 555 111.
