Police are asking residents to please be vigilant after two reports of scammers defrauding people out of money after creating fake pet for sale adverts have been reported.

The incidents which involved people paying deposits for the sale of puppies were reported in Gloucester earlier this week and saw people from out of county arrive at an address after an online advert fraudulently provided the location.

The scammers are targeting those all around the country asking for deposits to be paid before providing a random address that can be used to collect the animals.

It is believed that the scammers are using a different address to where they live when posting the online advertisements so that they cannot be traced.

Action Fraud have issued a warning about this and officers are asking everyone to be cautious when arranging to purchase pets/items online or paying deposits as the lockdown now means that you are unable to meet the seller in person or confirm their true identity.

More information as well as advice from Action Fraud can be found here: https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/news/animal-lovers-looking-for-pets-in-lockdown-defrauded-of-nearly-300000-in-two-months

Anyone who believes they have been the victim of this can report it to Action Fraud online or by calling 0300 123 2040.

Alternatively information can be reported to police by calling 101 or using our online reporting tool: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/soh/something-youve-seen-or-heard/
