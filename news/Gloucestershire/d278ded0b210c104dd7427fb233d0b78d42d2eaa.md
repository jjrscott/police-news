Three men from Wales have been issued with Coronavirus tickets after officers conducted enquiries into reports of hare coursing in Dumbleton yesterday (Wednesday).

Officers from the Neighbourhood Policing and Specialist Operations teams were called to an estate in Dumbleton last night after concerns were raised about men in the area and upon attendance they were found to be taking part in hare coursing.

The men were issued with Coronavirus tickets as regulations which came into effect on 5 November mean that no person may leave or be outside of the place where they are living without a reasonable excuse.

A number of items of hunting paraphernalia were seized under the Poaching Prevention Act and officers from the Rural Crime Team will now be interviewing the men under caution as part of their enquiries.
