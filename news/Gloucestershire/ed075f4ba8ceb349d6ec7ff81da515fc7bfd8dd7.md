Two men who were found hiding in a Wendy House last night were arrested after a member of the public reported seeing suspicious activity in the Benhall area of Cheltenham.

Police were called to Miserden Road shortly after 11.50pm after two men had been seen trying the handles of cars parked on the road.

Officers from the Specialist Operations team attended and a containment was put on the area whilst searches were conducted along with assistance from the National Police Air Service.

Searches resulted in two men being located hiding in a Wendy House within a garden on Swanswell Drive and they were subsequently arrested.

The men, who are from Cheltenham and aged 21 and 24, were arrested on suspicion of vehicle interference and remain in custody at this time.
