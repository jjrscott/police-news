Officers in the Forest of Dean are investigating a number of reports of nuisance motorbikes over the past few weeks.

Working with Forestry England the officers are keen to receive information about offenders, but also to remind members of the public of their rights and responsibilities as they enjoy the forest.

On Thursday 30 April two adults were seen riding off-road motorbikes in the Nagshead Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), near the road from Cannop to Parkend.

When they spotted a Forestry England ranger they made off, riding off-track for the length of the site and then along a stone road where they narrowly missed a dog walker.

PC Cath McDay, rural and wildlife officer in the Forest of Dean, said she regularly receives reports about offences being committed in Tidenham, the Forest of Dean nature reserves and the Offa's Dyke trail.

She said: "Reports like this are very worrying. Not only are these bikers breaking local byelaws they are threatening the safety of other members of the public and putting nesting birds and other wildlife at risk.

"We are lucky to live in such a beautiful area, with all this woodland on our doorstep to enjoy, but it is everyone's responsibility to stick to the rules and protect it for others.

"I would like to hear from anyone who has information about offenders to come forward and report them so that we can take appropriate action."

A spokesperson from Forestry England said:

"Riding motorbikes in the forest is against our byelaws and therefore anyone who does so is committing an offence.

"Causing damage to an SSSI is also an offence, and particularly important at this time of year as birds are nesting in the area.

"We are pleased to be working with local police officers to prevent these incidents, and would encourage members of the public to report anyone committing offences."

Anyone with information is asked to contact Gloucestershire Constabulary on 101 or via the website https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report
