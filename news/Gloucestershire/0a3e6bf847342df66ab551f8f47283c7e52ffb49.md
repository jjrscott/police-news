Officers in the Cotswolds are appealing for witnesses to a robbery which took place in Chipping Campden yesterday (Thursday).

Police were called to a shop on High Street shortly before 7.10am yesterday following reports of an armed robbery.

It was reported that two men, who were wearing balaclavas and carrying knives, entered the shop before threatening staff, demanding keys for the safe and taking a quantity of cash from inside.

They are believed to have left the shop in what was described as a dark blue/black Mercedes Benz and drove in the direction of Dover Hill.

No-one was injured during the incident.

The men were described as follows:

1) A tall black man of proportionate build who was wearing a green jumper, dark gilet, white gloves, a blue scarf which covered his lower face, blue jeans and white trainers.

2) A shorter black man who was wearing a white hoodie underneath a black bomber jacket which had green cuffs, dark coloured gloves, black trainers, black trousers and was carrying a dark coloured rucksack

Both of the men are believed to have been carrying knives.

Investigating officers would like to hear from anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity in the area or who may have CCTV/dashcam footage of the incident taking place.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting incident 43 of 30 January or completing the 'update a crime report' on Gloucestershire Constabulary's website by referencing the incident number: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/
