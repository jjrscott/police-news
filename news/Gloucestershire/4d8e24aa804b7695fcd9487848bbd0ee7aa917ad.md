Members of the public are invited to attend an event which will be celebrating the 180th anniversary of Gloucestershire Constabulary.

This is taking place at the Gloucestershire Heritage Hub in Clarence Row, Alvin Street, Gloucester on Tuesday 10 December.

The event will be running from 5.15pm to 8.15pm and our staff, including Chief Constable Rod Hansen and archivist Sue Webb, will be available to show people around.

The Heritage Hub is the home of the Gloucestershire Police Archives and there will be a number of our fascinating collection of historic documents and artefacts on display.

Some of these go back to the very start of the Constabulary's existence (in the early days of Queen Victoria's reign) while others are more recent.

The event, which includes refreshments, is free and suitable for the whole family.

There will be a number of displays that will be of interest both keen historians as well as children and families.

Younger visitors will get the chance to dress up in police uniform, learn more about how children were punished for the most minor things, and even taste some old-fashioned prison gruel.
