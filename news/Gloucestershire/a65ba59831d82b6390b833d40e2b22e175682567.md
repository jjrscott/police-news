Officers in Gloucester are appealing for witnesses to a collision between a van and cyclist at the end of last month.

The collision happened on Cole Avenue at 6.40pm on Friday 30 October and took place at the traffic lights for the junction with Epney and Podsmead roads.

The cyclist left before the driver could speak to him and officers would like to identify him to check on his welfare. He was riding a dark coloured bicycle with white writing and wearing blue shorts which had a white band, a blue face covering and dark coat.

The cyclist or anyone who witnessed the collision and has dashcam footage is asked to submit this by calling 101 and quoting incident 248 of 2 November or by visiting: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/contact/af/contact-us/us/a-crime-that-has-already-been-reported/
