Officers in the Cotswolds are appealing for witnesses to an assault which occurred on Saturday (27 February) at around 8pm on the High Street, Bourton on the Water.

It was reported that the victim was walking near to The Chip Shed when an orange coloured 4x4 pick-up stopped.

The male driver and male front seat passenger got out of the vehicle and approached the victim.

The driver then punched the victim in the face before both the driver and front seat passenger returned to the vehicle which drove away towards Lansdowne and the A429 Fosse Way.

The victim sustained facial injuries which did not require medical treatment.

Investigating officers are asking anyone who witnessed this to get in contact quoting incident 525 of 27 February.
