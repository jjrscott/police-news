Officers are appealing for witnesses after a small Shiba Inu dog was attacked by another dog at Gloucester Park last week.

It was reported that the Shiba Inu was being walked in the park at around 6.30pm on Wednesday (29 April) when the attack took place.

A large grey dog, believed to be a Cane Corso which is similar to a large Pitbull or Mastiff, was tied up to a tree before it pulled with force snapping the lead and attacking the Shiba Inu.

The Shiba Inu was taken to a veterinary clinic where it received treatment for bite wounds, blood loss and concussion.

The offending dog was accompanied by a group of four/five men, including its owner, who were sat nearby at the time.

The owner of the larger dog has been identified, but officers are asking for anyone who was in the park at the time and saw the incident or the dog and men just before to call 101 quoting incident 312 of 29 April.
