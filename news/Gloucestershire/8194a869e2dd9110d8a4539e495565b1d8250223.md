Officers are appealing for witnesses to a robbery which took place in Gloucester last week.

Police were called to the Llanthony Secunda Priory last Monday evening (3 February) following reports that an 18-year-old man had been robbed by three unknown people.

This was reported to have taken place between 6.15pm and 6.30pm and saw the group approach the victim whilst he was walking along the canal path.

He was approached from behind before the group attacked him and stole his wallet and black Apple Watch.

The victim was treated by paramedics at the scene and did not require hospital treatment.

Two members of the group were described as being short males who were wearing all black outfits with their hoods up and the third person was described as being a female who was wearing a light coloured jacket with the hood up.

The Llanthony Secunda Priory is known to be a popular walking area and investigating officers are asking anyone who has information or witnessed this taking place to call 101 quoting incident 379 of 3 February.

Information can also be submitted by using the 'update a crime report' form on our website: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/

An 18-year-old woman from Gloucester was arrested in connection with the incident and has since been released on bail.
