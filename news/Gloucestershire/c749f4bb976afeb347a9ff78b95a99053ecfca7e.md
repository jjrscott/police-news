Officers from the Cheltenham Neighbourhood Policing Team are appealing for witnesses to garage breaks that have taken place in Benhall and St Marks.

Between last Tuesday and Friday (26 to 29 Jan), a number of garage breaks were reported in both the Winstone complex off Stanway Road and the Edgeworth complex off Miserden Road.

There were also a number of reports of garages being targeted in Benhall Gardens during the same dates.
