Officers are appealing for witnesses to an assault which happened during an altercation in Cheltenham town centre earlier this month.

Police were called to the Lower High Street at around 8.45pm on Sunday 12 July following reports that a group of people were seen to be fighting with items such as a cricket bat and bars.

Officers attended to find that a man had been assaulted and sustained facial injuries which required medical treatment. The windscreen of the victim's car was also smashed during the altercation.

Three people were arrested in connection with the incident and have since been released under investigation but officers are still keen to hear from anyone who was in the area or witnessed this taking place.

Several members of the public are believed to have been in the area at the time of the altercation and anyone who has information is asked to call 101 quoting incident 477 of 12 July.
