Officers are asking residents to be vigilant after a number of incidents of draught excluder thefts have been reported in recent days.

It was reported that unknown offenders have been removing all or part of draught excluders from the inside of letter boxes at a number of properties in Cinderford.

These incidents have been reported as taking place on Westerley Close, Belle Vue Road, Albion Road and Oakdene.

Officers are also aware of incidents that occurred towards the end of last year in Innsworth, Gloucester, and Mitcheldean.

Residents are encouraged to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity as it's believed that individuals may be doing this to gain better access to properties or to steal the keys to the home or car.

It is advised to keep house and cars keys out of sight and reach as offenders have previously used bamboo sticks to steal them from inside.

As well as this you shouldn't leave keys in the door as they can be reached and removed or the door opened from turning the key from the outside.

Anyone who believes that they have been the victim of this is or who has witnessed suspicious activity is asked to report this by calling 101 and quoting incident 276 of 7 January or by emailing PC Buckle on Lee.Buckle@gloucestershire.pnn.police.uk
