Officers are appealing for information following the theft of two quad bikes in Chepstow in the early hours of yesterday morning, Monday 11 May.

Between 2.45am and 5am offenders forced entry to an outbuilding in Tidenham, Chepstow and stole the items.

One of the bikes was later recovered from Tidenham Chase car park by police, however the other, a red Honda 300 quad, is still missing.

It is believed the vehicle was taken towards St Briavels on Tidenham Chase and investigating officers are asking for anyone who has seen the quad bike to contact police.

Anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area at the time is also asked to call police on 101 and quote incident 42 of 11 May.
