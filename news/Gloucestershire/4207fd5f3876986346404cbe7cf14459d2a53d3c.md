Officers are appealing for witnesses to a burglary which took place in Winchcombe in the early hours of this morning, Thursday 27 February.

Police were called to Evesham Road shortly after 4.30am with a report that three men had forced entry to a property.

The men stole jewellery and other items prior to being disturbed by the homeowners. The value of the stolen items is not yet known but is believed to be significant.

The men, who were wearing hooded clothing and face coverings, then left the premises, running towards the railway line leading to Winchcombe Steam Railway Station. No-one was injured in the incident.

Officers responded, along with the support of a police dog, however the offenders were not located and police are now appealing for information.

Anyone who was in the area at the time, has dashcam or CCTV footage, or saw the men who may have been involved is asked to call police on 101 and quote incident number 37 of 27 February.
