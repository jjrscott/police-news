Officers are appealing for information to identify a child cyclist and motorist after a collision in Cheltenham earlier this week.

A BMX and a vehicle described as a white car/van with an orange light on the top and a contractor logo on the side were in collision close to the central reservation on the A40 westbound carriageway at the Arle Court roundabout at around 5pm on Wednesday 17 March.

A witness has described how the cyclist was shaken and had a grazed arm and damaged jacket but told the driver he was okay.

The cyclist is described as a 15 or 16-year-old boy, white, with dark hair. He was wearing a black helmet, black bomber-style jacket and what looked like school trousers and shoes.

It is believed a pick-up truck also had to brake suddenly during the incident.

Officers want the boy and driver to come forward so we can check what happened and that the boy is okay.

Anyone with information about the incident should fill in the following online form, quoting crash reference 1029168 https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/contact/af/contact-us/us/a-crime-that-has-already-been-reported/.
