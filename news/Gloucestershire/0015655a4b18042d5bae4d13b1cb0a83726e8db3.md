Police are appealing for witnesses following a robbery on Great Western Road in Gloucester last weekend.

The incident happened between 9.30pm and 10pm on Saturday (16 May) when a man who was walking down an alley was forced to hand over alcohol by two men.

He was then threatened with violence unless he bought more alcohol and was walked from the alley onto Great Western Road and towards London Road.

Officers are keen to speak to a jogger who went past at the time as he may have witnessed what happened or have information that will help with enquiries.

Anyone who lives in the area and has information or CCTV footage is asked to submit this by calling Gloucestershire Constabulary on 101 and quoting incident 510 of 16 May.

Information can also be submitted via our online form: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/

Two men were arrested in connection with the incident and have since been released on bail pending further enquiries.
