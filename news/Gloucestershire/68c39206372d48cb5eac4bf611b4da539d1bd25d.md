Officers in Bishop's Cleeve are appealing for information after a catalytic converter was stolen from a car parked in a supermarket at the weekend.

It was reported that a catalytic converter was cut from a black Toyota which was parked at Lidl on Evesham Road between 1.30pm and 2.30pm on Sunday (20 September).

Commonly converters are stolen from vehicles parked on the road and offenders will pull up alongside their targeted vehicle before exiting and cutting off the converter with a saw or angle grinder.

Anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed this taking place or any form of suspicious activity is asked to call 101 quoting incident 265 of 20 September.
