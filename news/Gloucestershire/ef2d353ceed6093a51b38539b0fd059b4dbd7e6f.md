Officers are appealing for witnesses after bicycles were stolen from two teenagers in Churchdown at the end of last month.

Police were called to Churchdown Skate Park on Tuesday 28 July following reports that two teenagers had been threatened with a knife by another teenage before both of their bicycles were stolen.

This is believed to have taken place at around 4pm and saw the offender run in the direction of the Aviator Pub along with two other people.

The offender was described as being in a group of three teenagers who were all wearing dark clothing and face coverings.

Anyone who was in the area at the time and hasn't already spoken to police is asked to call 101 quoting incident 325 of 28 July.
