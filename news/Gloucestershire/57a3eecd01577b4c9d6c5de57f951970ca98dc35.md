Officers have issued an e-fit image of a woman they want to speak to about an an unprovoked assault in Cheltenham in September.

Local police have already appealed for information about the attack on Hanover Street on Friday 20 September.

Now an e-fit has been produced to help the enquiry.

The victim, a woman in her 30s, was approached at around 8.30am by a woman who punched her in the face.

She suffered bruising and swelling to her right eye and the force of the punch means her vision is still affected.

The offender is described as white, in her late 20s or early 30s, of slim build, with shoulder-length black hair.

Anyone who recognises the woman in the e-fit image is urged to call 101 and quote incident 230 of 20 September.
