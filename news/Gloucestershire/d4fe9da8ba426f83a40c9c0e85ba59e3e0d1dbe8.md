Officers in the Cotswolds are appealing for witnesses following an incident of dangerous driving in Cirencester.

Police were called at around 5pm on Saturday 2 May following reports that a silver BMW 1 series was being driven in a dangerous manner.

It was reported that the driver reversed a short distance down the right hand carriageway that is adjacent to the Beeches Car Park before making a 'J' turn manoeuvre.

The car hit the central reservation and mounted the pavement outside the Barn Theatre narrowly missing pedestrians and a wall.

Investigating officers are asking anyone who witnessed the incident, the car in the area or has dashcam footage to contact police on 101 quoting incident 325 of 2 May.
