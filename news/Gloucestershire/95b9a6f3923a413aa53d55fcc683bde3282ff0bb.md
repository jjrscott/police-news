Gloucestershire Constabulary is seeking the opinions of local residents as part of this year's local policing survey.

The survey, which was launched today (Wednesday 1 July) is live for two weeks and aims to gather the opinions of local residents about their views on the policing response to Covid-19 as well as finding out what makes an area a good place to live.

Senior Research Officer Amy Dyde said: "We are keen to learn lessons from our response to policing the COVID-19 pandemic and are also interested in residents' views and opinions of their local police in general, whether you have been in direct contact with us or not.

"We will use the information that we gather to help us understand what we do well and can build on as well as how we can improve the services that we provide in the future.

"I would be grateful if you could please spare 5-10 minutes of your time to answer the questions with the survey. All views and opinions will be treated anonymously."

(This survey has now closed).
