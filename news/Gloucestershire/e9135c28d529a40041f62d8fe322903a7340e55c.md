Police were called to the Heathfield area at around midday on Saturday (21 March) after members of the public witnessed a man burgling a house, the caller tried to detain the man but he ran away and left.

He was described as being in his 20's, 6ft tall, of a medium build and was wearing skinny black jeans and a black hooded top with 'PNP' on the front.

Officers want anyone who saw the incident as well anyone who has CCTV, or dashcam footage of the area at the time to contact them on 101 quoting incident 172 of 21 March.
