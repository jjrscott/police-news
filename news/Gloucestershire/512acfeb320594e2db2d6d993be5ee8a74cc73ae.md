A man has been arrested after he was identified on CCTV as part of an investigation into a burglary in Cheltenham and the use of a suspected stolen bank card.

Police were called to Brooklyn Road in Cheltenham on Monday (28 December) after it was reported that an unknown offender had broken into a property before stealing a number of items including bank cards, games consoles and mobile phones.

Officers from the Cheltenham Neighbourhood and Local Policing Teams conducted enquiries into the burglary and CCTV enquiries identified a man using a bank card which was believed to have been stolen during the burglary.

The man was identified by a local officer before being arrested by officers from the Force Crime Operations Team yesterday morning (Tuesday 29 December).

The 35-year-old from Cheltenham was arrested on suspicion of dwelling burglary and remains in police custody this morning (Wednesday 30 December). A number of suspected stolen items were seized as part of the arrest.

Sergeant Julia Martin-Jones from the Neighbourhood Policing Team said: "this arrest really shows how working together catches criminals and I would like to thank everyone who has been involved in this investigation.

"I understand that this incident gained a lot of attention from those living in the St Marks area of Cheltenham and we are now working to gather the evidence that is needed to hopefully secure a charge against the man."
