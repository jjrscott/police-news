"It was horrendous - we can't get the image out of our heads" says the owner of a Yorkie puppy killed in a dog attack on Sunday.

Officers are appealing for information about a dog walker after a Yorkshire Terrier was killed after two dogs attacked it in East Wood Nature Reserve on the outskirts of the Forest of Dean.

The incident took place at around 3pm on Sunday afternoon (21 February) after the unknown man's Pointer dogs attacked Ettie, the small Yorkshire Terrier, who died of its injuries the following day.

The Pointers surrounded Ettie, picked her up and violently shook her.

The owner of the two Pointers did not try to control his dogs and did not provide any contact details to the Yorkie's owner.

The first Pointer is described as being honey coloured and the second as being a brown or brindle colour.

The Pointer's owner is described as around 50 years old, 5ft 8ins tall, with dark grey hair and dark bushy eyebrows.

Mrs Burgess, from the Forest of Dean, was Ettie's owner and said: "We were on a Sunday walk in the woods and this man approached with his two dogs off the lead and it all just went horribly wrong.

"Our little Ettie panicked a bit and those two dogs surrounded her and the next thing you know she was in the dogs mouth and was just being thrown like a ragdoll. It was horrific to watch it happen.

"The whole scene was just horrible. We can't get the image out of our heads.

"We're devastated - we can't stop crying. She was such a perfect little puppy."

Investigating officers are appealing for witnesses and any information about the man who was out walking his two Pointer dogs.

Police are also asking the owner of the dog to get in contact quoting incident 331 of 21 January.

Officers would also like to speak to any witnesses of this incident or anyone who believes they may know the identity of the Pointer's owner.
