Police are warning residents in Stonehouse to be alert after a report was received of a fraudulent Amazon scam call at the weekend.

The daughter of an elderly resident contacted police on Saturday to report that their mother had been contacted by a bogus caller who stated they worked for Amazon.

The fraudster went on to tell the elderly woman that her account had been compromised and that she needed to provide her bank details for the issue to be fixed.

He advised the woman that she needed to create a unique code through her telephone banking app which she shared before her family noticed a pending transaction of Â£20,000 on her account.

On this occasion the victim's bank stopped the money from being transferred however we want to ensure that others are not targeted.

Offenders will often spoof their telephone numbers to appear genuine, or make it look like they are calling from a local phone number.

If you are concerned about the content of the message, please contact the company or organisation the call is claiming to be from via a trusted means.

Elderly residents are more likely to be targeted by this type of scam so please share this warning with them.

Anyone who believes that they have been the victim of a fraudulent phone call can report this by calling police on 101 or Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.

The Telephone Preference Service (TPS) is free and can help reduce the number of nuisance and scam calls you receive. To register, please visit: https://www.tpsonline.org.uk/register
