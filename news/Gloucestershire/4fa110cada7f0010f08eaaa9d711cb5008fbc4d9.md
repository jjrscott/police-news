Officers are appealing for witnesses after a number of antique items were stolen during a burglary near Cirencester earlier this week.

Police were called to a property in the Woodmancote area of Cirencester on Monday evening (13 January) following reports of a burglary.

It was reported that offenders had forced entry to the property at around 5.30pm before stealing a number of high value items of antique items from inside.

The stolen items included:

Four George 111 silver candle sticks (pictured)
A set of silver American Indian made cufflinks which have a turquoise eagle
A set of gold enamel cufflinks with diamond studs
A set of gold cufflinks with British Game Birds
A silver university ring from Claremont university in California
A gold school ring from AIS in Vienna, Austria
20 enamel silver pill boxes with various scenes on the lid
Four silver/wooden wine coasters (pictured)
Six small silver drink coasters
A silver bowl
Two solid silver partridges (8/9 inches tall)
A solid silver fox (3 inches x 1.5 inches)
A soft sided black Victorinox suitcase
Officers investigating the burglary would like to hear from anyone who saw any suspicious activity in the area or has been offered any of the stolen items for sale.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting incident 421 of 13 January.

We are currently running an anti-burglary campaign and would encourage the public to look at installing a 'WIDE' combination of security devices as they can provide 49 times more protection against residential burglary with entry compared to having no devices installed.

A 'WIDE' combination includes; Window locks, Internal lights on sensors, Double or door deadbolts and External lights on sensors.

More information on the campaign and ways to protect your home can be found by visiting: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/police-forces/gloucestershire-constabulary/areas/gloucestershire/campaigns/campaigns/2019/burglary/
