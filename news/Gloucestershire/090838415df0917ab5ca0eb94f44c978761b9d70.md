Officers are appealing for witnesses and dashcam footage of a collision where an elderly pedestrian suffered serious head injuries.

At 6.40pm yesterday, Wednesday 4 March, a collision occurred on Matson Avenue at the junction of Winsley Road, Gloucester.

The collision involved a Black Vauxhall Zafira and a 77-year-old male pedestrian.

Emergency services attended and the pedestrian was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital by the ambulance service. He was later taken to Southmead Hospital in Bristol due to the seriousness of his injuries and he remains there today.

A man aged in his 30s and from Gloucester was arrested on suspicion of driving while under the influence of drugs. He has since been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Police are appealing for any witnesses or drivers with dashcam footage of the incident to call 101, quoting incident number 378 of 4 March.
