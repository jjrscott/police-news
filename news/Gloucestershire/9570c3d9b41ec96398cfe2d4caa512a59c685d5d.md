Officers are appealing for help in identifying a man who held up a Nisa store at knife point.

Several hundred pounds in cash was taken in the incident, which happened in Beaumont Road, Cheltenham, just after 7pm on Sunday 19 April.

The man, who was wearing dark clothing, threatened a member of staff with the knife before running off with the money. Nobody was injured in the incident.

Police have described the suspect as a white male, aged 25 to 30, 5ft 11in tall, with dark hair.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or who can help identify the man should call police on 101 and quote incident 341 of 19 April. You can also give information to independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Alternatively, information can also be submitted to police by using the 'update a crime report' form on the Constabulary's website: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/
