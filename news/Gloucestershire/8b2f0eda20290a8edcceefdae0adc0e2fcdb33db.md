A man was injured as thieves tried to gain entry to a business property in Winchcombe last week and police are appealing for information to try to trace the offenders.

The incident happened at about 11pm on Monday 27 January.

The man had been in the Old Boys School in Gretton Road where Radio Winchcombe and British Bespoke Auctions are based.

On leaving the premises he was assaulted by five offenders who were trying to break into the building.

He was hit over the head, knocked to the floor and ordered to go back inside the building.

As a result he suffered a lump to his head but no serious injuries.

The offenders stole a bag containing the man's wallet and mobile phone, but the items were later found nearby.

The offenders also attempted to force entry to British Bespoke Auctions within the Old Boys School.

Internal security measures ensured that the offenders were unable to fully access the building and nothing was stolen.

Officers investigating the incident would like to hear from anyone who witnessed any suspicious people or vehicles in the area of Winchcombe, on Monday 27 January between 10pm and midnight.

They are keen to hear from anyone who may have dash-cam footage from the Winchcombe area within this date and time frame.

Since the burglary officers have been conducting extra patrols in and around areas which are likely to be targets for similar offences and have advised business owners to review their security.

Anyone with information is asked to call Gloucestershire Constabulary on 101 quoting incident 490 of 27 January.
