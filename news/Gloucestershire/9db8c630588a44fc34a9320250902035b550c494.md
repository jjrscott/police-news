A woman suffered serious injuries after being struck by a car in Gloucester yesterday evening (Sunday 5 January).

A black Mitsubishi Colt was in collision with the pedestrian on Finlay Road just before 5.30pm.

The woman, aged in her 50s and from Gloucester, was taken to Southmead Hospital in Bristol. She remains there in a serious condition.

The road was closed while a serious collision investigation took place and reopened later that evening.

Two people were arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice and remain in police custody today, Monday 6 January.

Any witnesses who haven't spoken to police should call 101 and quote incident 266 of 5 January.
