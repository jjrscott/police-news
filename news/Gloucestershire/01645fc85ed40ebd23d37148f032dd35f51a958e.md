Shortly after 10.30pm on Tuesday 12 May a member of the public reported suspicions to police about a vehicle due to its manner of driving.

It had been travelling on the A4136 near Coleford and officers in the local area were advised.

The vehicle was located by police a short while later and two people were spoken to.

Two suitcases were found to contain human remains and two people, a woman aged in her 20s from Birmingham and a man aged in his 30s from Wolverhampton, were subsequently arrested.

They remain in police custody following a 36-hour extension granted by magistrates at around midday today, Thursday 14 May.

A vehicle was also seized.

Investigating officers believe there is one victim, a woman, and forensic examinations are ongoing to confirm her identity.

Senior Investigating Officer DCI John Turner said: "The nature of this incident is distressing and we're working around the clock to fully understand what has happened.

"Someone's life has been lost and our priority is to identify the victim and get answers for her family.

"Searches have taken place in the surrounding area for evidence gathering and contrary to media reports no remains have been found as part of these searches.

"Our Major Crime Investigation Team is working in collaboration with the West Midlands Police homicide team to carry out further enquiries."
