Between Thursday 7 May and Friday 8 May three bikes belonging to NHS workers were stolen from hospital grounds at Gloucestershire Royal.

At around 3pm last Thursday a white Giant women's road bike, with black taped handles and worth around £500 was stolen from the bike shed (incident 386 of 7 May).

A second bike worth around £1,200, a Cube Agree GTC which was black with blue tape on the handles, was also stolen (incident 409 of 7 May).

The following morning police received a report that a black electric bike worth around £1,000 had been stolen between 5pm on Thursday and 6.10am on Friday.

Anyone with information about the thefts or who has seen these items advertised for sale online is urged to call police on 101.
