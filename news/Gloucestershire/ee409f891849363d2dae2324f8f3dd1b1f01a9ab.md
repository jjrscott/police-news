Officers have been granted a 36-hour magistrates' extension to continue questioning two people who were arrested on suspicion of murder.

Overnight a 12-hour custody extension had been granted for both the woman aged in her 20s and from Birmingham and the man aged in his 30s and from Wolverhampton.

The further 36-hour extension was granted at around midday today and means they can remain in custody for further questioning.

Forensic testing is ongoing to establish the identity of the victim after human remains were found by police shortly after 11.30pm on Tuesday 12 May.

A post-mortem examination is also taking place.

Due to the ongoing investigation road closures and scene guards are likely to remain in place for at least the rest of today.

We would like to thank local residents and those impacted by the cordons for their patience during this time.
