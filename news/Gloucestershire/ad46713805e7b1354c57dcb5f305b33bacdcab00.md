Officers are appealing for information after two teenage girls were followed by a man in Gloucester last week.

The incident began as the girls were in McDonald's on Westgate Street at around 4.25pm last Tuesday (26 November).

The girls were sat inside when they noticed that a man was hanging around outside.

They left McDonalds and walked into Poundland where they were followed by the man.

The girls then went to Primark and were followed around the shop by the same man before leaving and walking through Kingswalk.

The girls continued to the Entertainer and this time the man carried on walking.

A few minutes later, the girls left the Entertainer and walked towards GL1 leisure centre when they spotted the man sat at the bus station.

He is understood to have followed the girls as they continued their journey before leaving when they went into GL1 and told a member of staff about what had happened.

The man was described as being in his mid-20s and had olive coloured skin; he was of a slim build and average height.

He was wearing a green padded jacket with a fur lined hood and dark coloured ripped jeans with trainers.

Anyone who was in the area at the time or has information is asked to call 101 quoting incident 86 of 27 November.
