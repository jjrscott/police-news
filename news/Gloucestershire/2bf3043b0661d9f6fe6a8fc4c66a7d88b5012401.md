In light of the current national situation in relation to the coronavirus and as a precautionary measure, the Keeping Young People Safe Online, An Adults Guide" event due to take place at Dursley Community Fire and Rescue Station tomorrow (Saturday 14 March) has been cancelled.

We will look to rearrange this event at the earliest opportunity.
