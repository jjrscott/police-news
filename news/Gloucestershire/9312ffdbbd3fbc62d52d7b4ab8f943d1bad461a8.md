Officers are appealing for information that may help to identify a body which was found in Gloucester earlier this week.

Police were called to the River Severn near Maisemore shortly after 11.30am on Thursday following reports that the body of a man had been found in the water.

Officers have made a number of enquiries to try and identify the man and there are no reports of missing people matching his description.

The man is believed to be white, between the ages of 25 to 35 and had short brown hair with a tidy beard.

When found he was wearing dark blue jeans and a beige t-shirt with a dark blue top.

The death is being treated as non suspicious and officers are asking anyone with information to call 101 quoting incident 165 of 9 April.
