A cannabis grow with more than 350 plants has been dismantled after it was discovered at a premises in an industrial unit in Lydney yesterday, Tuesday 4 August.

On Tuesday morning police were informed that a strong smell had been coming from the unit, which was rented, and the owner noticed a sudden increase in electric bills.

The local policing team attended and more than 350 plants were discovered, as well as two beds suggesting people had been living inside the unit.

No-one was there when police arrived and no arrests have been made at this stage with the investigation ongoing.

The find was dismantled after it was made safe by electricians.

Anyone with information about this is asked to call police on 101 and quote incident 75 of 4 August.

If you believe drug activity is taking place you can report this to police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111.
