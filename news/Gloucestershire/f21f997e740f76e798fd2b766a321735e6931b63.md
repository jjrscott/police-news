We're appealing for information that may help to locate 56-year-old Michael Stock who has been reported missing from Stroud.

Michael was last seen near Stroud's Vue Cinema on Merrywalks at 2.30pm yesterday (Thursday) and hasn't returned home since which has caused concerns for his welfare.

He is described as being 5ft 8ins tall, of a stocky build, has short dark brown/grey hair and is unshaven.

When last seen he was wearing a burnt orange puffer jacket, blue checked short sleeved shirt, blue fur lined long sleeved checked lumber jacket, black jogging bottoms and light brown trainers.

It is believed that Michael may be travelling to London.

Anyone who has seen Michael since yesterday or has information on his whereabouts is asked to call 101 quoting incident 361 of 21 January.
