A man has been charged in connection with an incident where officers were abused whilst attending reports of a house party last month.

Last Thursday (21 May), Igor Kompus aged 41 and of Nelson Street in Gloucester was charged with one count of racially/religiously aggravated harassment and one count of using threatening/abusive/insulting behaviour to cause harassment, alarm or distress.

He was released on bail to appear at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 17 June.

The charges relate to an incident where police were called to Hatherley Road in Gloucester on Thursday 2 April after a resident reported concerns about a house party that was taking place.
