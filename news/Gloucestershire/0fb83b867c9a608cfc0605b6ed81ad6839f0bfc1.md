A man has been sentenced to ten months in prison following an investigation by the Cheltenham Neighbourhood Policing and Local Investigation teams.

Lee Henry, 38 and of Compton Road in Cheltenham appeared at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court yesterday (Wednesday) where he was sentenced after pleading guilty to 13 counts of shoplifting, three counts of theft of a pedal cycle, one count of assaulting a police officer and one count of a non-dwelling burglary.

Officers first became aware of Henry's offending when they were conducting enquiries into incidents reported as part of a spate of shed/garage breaks and thefts from motor vehicles around Cheltenham earlier this month.

Inspector Rich Smith from the Cheltenham Neighbourhood Policing Team said: "We welcome the sentence as it represents a clear message about the impact that Lee Henry has had on the local community.

"The recent enquiries to deal with him have drawn upon all the strands of Neighbourhood, Investigation and Response Policing to ensure that we could deliver the best possible evidence to the court.

"We also worked to ensure that those who believe that they can assault officers in the course of their duties are supported by the courts, in the sentences that are given out.

"By securing this conviction we have made the people and property of Cheltenham far safer."
