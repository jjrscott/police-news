A Cheltenham man is due to reappear in court next month after being charged with two burglary offences.

Ben Jones, 31 and of Vittoria Walk was arrested on Saturday (22 February) after officers from the Cheltenham Neighbourhood Policing Team were conducting enquiries into burglaries which had been committed at two businesses.

Jones was subsequently charged with two counts of burglary with intent to steal and appeared at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court yesterday (Monday) where he was remanded to reappear on Tuesday 11 March.
