Police are appealing for witnesses after Â£1,500 worth of antiques were stolen from a store in Moreton-In-Marsh on Sunday 1 March.

At about 2.15pm a man was seen apparently leaning against a cabinet in the store, but is now believed to have been trying keys in the lock, whilst using his mobile phone almost constantly.

He is described as 6ft tall, quite stocky and with a London accent and police believe that he was accompanied by two other men. He is known to be using his mobile phone almost constantly.

Investigating officers would like the public and in particular antiques dealers to remain vigilant to this type of crime.

They are asking anyone who recognises the man pictured, the stolen items or who witnessed anything suspicious regarding this incident to call police on 101 and quote incident 94 of 2 March.

Alternatively, information can also be submitted to police by using the 'update a crime report' form on the Constabulary's website: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/

You can also give information to independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
