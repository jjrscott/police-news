Officers in Stroud are appealing for witnesses to an assault which took place last month.

Police were called to Paganhill Lane at around 9.15pm on Saturday 11 July following reports that two men were fighting.

Officers attended and it was found that one of the men had been punched which resulted in him needing hospital treatment for a fractured jaw.

The offender was described as being a white man who was 5ft 9ins tall, of a slim build and had short black hair. It is understood that he left the area on foot.

Anyone with information is asked to submit this by calling 101 and quoting incident 489 of 11 July or emailing PC Horwood-Jones on 252457@gloucestershire.police.uk
