Officers investigating an incident of criminal damage in Cheltenham have issued CCTV images of a man they would like to speak to in connection with this.

Police received a report that windows of a flat at Amberley Court on Goldsmith Road had been smashed by a man with a wooden bat.

It was reported that the man arrived at a block of flats before using the bat to smash the windows of one property. He then ran down the stairs before leaving the area in a silver Mazda which is believed to have since been scrapped.

This took place at around 2.40pm on Sunday 9 February.

Officers have conducted a number of enquiries but have been unable to identify the man pictured and anyone who recognises him is asked to call 101 quoting incident 367 of 9 February.
