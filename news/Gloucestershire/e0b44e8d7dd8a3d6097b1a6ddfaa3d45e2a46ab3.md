Officers are trying to locate two cars that were stolen during a burglary in Dursley over the weekend.

Police were called to a property off Dursley Road where it was reported that unknown offenders had gained entry at some point between 10.45pm on Saturday and 8.45am on Sunday before stealing two cars; a silver Peugeot 308 with the licence plate OY19 KJE and a red Seat Alhambra with the licence plate AO65 YJL as well as a wallet from the property.

If you were in the area and witnessed any suspicious activity or have information on the whereabouts of the cars please call 101 quoting incident number 53 of 22 March.

If you see the cars being driven please call 999.

Alternatively, information can also be submitted by using the 'update a crime report' form on the Constabulary's website: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/
