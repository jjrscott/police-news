Investigating officers have released CCTV images of a man they want to identify in connection with an assault which left a man requiring hospital treatment.

The victim was attacked and suffered facial fractures in the incident which happened in Gloucester.

A man, who said he had travelled from Swindon, had tried to gain access to a block of flats on Claremount Road where he was not a resident.

When this was refused the man pulled the victim aged in his 40s into the street and punched him in the face causing injuries which required hospital treatment.

Following CCTV enquiries, investigating officers would now like to speak to the man pictured in connection with the incident which happened around 1.42am on Saturday 26 December.
