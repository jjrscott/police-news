We are asking residents of Cheltenham to please be vigilant following a number of catalytic converter thefts in the town _._

Since the start of the year, there have been 12 reported incidents involving catalytic converters being stolen from vehicles whilst they were parked predominantly in public, business and residential car parks.

The majority of these offences have occurred in the Hatherley area of Cheltenham, with a disproportionate number of Honda Jazz models made between 2002 and 2008 being targeted.

It is believed that this model is targeted by thieves as the catalytic converter is easily accessible.

Vehicles with a high clearance off the ground, such as 4x4s are also at greater risk.

To reduce the risk of having your catalytic converter stolen, the following should be considered:

• Keeping your vehicle in a garage when possible

• Parking in such a way as to make access to the underside of your vehicle difficult - such as parking close of fences, walls or a kerb with the exhaust being closest to the fence, wall or kerb

• Parking in busy or well-lit areas

• Using a Park Mark safer parking approved car park. You can find one near you by visiting: www.parkmark.co.uk/car-park-finder

• Looking out for people working under cars in unusual locations such as car parks or individuals who are acting suspiciously

• Fitting a Thatcham approved alarm system- the type that activates when the vehicle is lifted or tilted

• Using a catalytic converter protection device or marking system

• If your catalytic converter is bolted on, you can ask for your local garage to weld the bolts to make it more difficult to remove
