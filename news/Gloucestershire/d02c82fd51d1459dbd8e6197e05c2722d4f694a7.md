Officers are appealing for witnesses to an assault which took place in Cheltenham last night (Thursday).

Police were called to Andover Road in Tivoli at around 11.15pm following reports of a collision.

It was reported that the victim had witnessed a collision where a vehicle had hit a parked car but the occupants were not in the area.

The occupants then returned to the vehicle and confronted the man as they had heard him calling police to provide information about what he had seen.

The victim was approached by a man who is believed to have been the passenger of a Ford Fiesta before being punched.

This caused bruising and swelling to the victim's face and officers would like to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time or witnessed the assault.

If you can help please call 101 quoting incident 438 of 12 December.

Alternatively information can be submitted by emailing PC Marley on Robert.Marley@gloucestershire.pnn.police.uk
