Officers are appealing for witnesses after distinctive jewellery was stolen during a burglary which took place in Stinchcombe earlier this month.

Police were called to a property near The Avenue at around 2.15pm on Thursday 19 December following reports that offenders had gained entry before stealing a quantity of jewellery from inside.

The burglary is believed to have taken place at some point between 4.30am on Tuesday 17th and 2pm on Thursday 19th and saw offenders leave with a number of distinctive pieces.

These include a solid silver ring with a dragon design (pictured above), a gold sovereign necklace, a signet ring, a silver banded ring which is inscribed with "forever mine" and a Rock branded watch.

Anyone who witnessed suspicious activity in the area or has been offered items matching the above descriptions is asked to call 101 quoting incident 215 of 19 December.

We are currently running an anti-burglary campaign and more information as well as tips on protecting your property can be found here.
