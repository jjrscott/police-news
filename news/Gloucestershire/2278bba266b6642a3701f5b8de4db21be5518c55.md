A three ** ** month closure order has been secured for a property on Gwen Davies Row in Tewkesbury following a hearing which was held at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court yesterday (Thursday 13 August).

The application, which came from the Tewkesbury Neighbourhood Policing Team, was granted after the judge heard concerns that had been raised by local residents about the behaviour of the tenants.

The order will be in effect until 12 November and prevents anyone other than staff of Bromford Housing, agents acting on their behalf and the emergency services from entering the address.

Inspector Cheryl Godwin said: "My team secured this order in conjunction with Bromford Housing as local residents had reported anti-social and nuisance behaviour from the tenants on a number of occasions.

"Anyone who is found in the property or attempting to enter is committing an offence and I would like to ask those living in the area to let us know if they see this happening by calling 101."

Closure orders are a fast, flexible power that can be used to protect victims and communities.

The orders are designed to tackle serious and persistent forms of antisocial behaviour, they close a property completely or partially, preventing access by anyone for three months, with a possible extension to six months.
