Officers are appealing for witnesses after damage was caused at a Gloucester sports ground a couple of weeks ago.

On the evening of Saturday 24 October, unknown people are believed to have gained access to the site of Longlevens Rugby Club before setting several pieces of wood on fire which caused damage to the first team pitch.

The damage was noticed last week and it was also reported that a mattress and shopping trolley have been dumped at the site recently.

Witnesses are asked to call 101 quoting incident 349 of 29 October or submit information online: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/soh/something-youve-seen-or-heard/
