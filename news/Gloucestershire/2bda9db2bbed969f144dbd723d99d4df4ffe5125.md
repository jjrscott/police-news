Police are appealing for information and witnesses following an attempted robbery in Cheltenham this morning, Thursday 3 September.

At around 6.50am a woman was approached from behind by a man in an alleyway which runs from Harp Hill down into Pillowell Drive with Wessex Drive to the rear of it.

He said that he wanted money and when she declined he grabbed her, ripping items of her clothing in what is believed to be an attempt to take her shoulder bag.

She was able to run away from the man as he then ran back up the alley towards Harp Hill.

He is described as a white man, around 5ft 7 or 8 ins in height, of a slim build, aged in his early 40s with dark hair and stubble.

The man was wearing a black zip front hooded top with the hood up and black jeans which appeared to be dirty.

The victim was not physically injured in the incident, although is understandably shaken by the ordeal.

Officers are investigating and appealing for anyone with information which could help the investigation to come forward.

Police are keen to hear from anyone who lives in the area who may have captured the man on CCTV or dashcam footage, or saw someone in the area that matches the description given.
