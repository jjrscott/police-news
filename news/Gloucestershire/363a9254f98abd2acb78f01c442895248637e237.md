Police are warning residents to be vigilant following a number of reports of fraudulent HMRC phone calls being received so far this week.

At least 16 scam phone calls have been reported county-wide since Monday with fraudsters claiming to be from the HMRC.

The fraudsters have been calling residents before stating that a warrant is out for their arrest after their national insurance number had been used fraudulently.

The caller was asked to press 1 to be transferred to a customer service agent.

Fortunately those who were called recognised that this was a scam however we are asking for this message to be shared to prevent anyone from being scammed in the future.

Telephone numbers can easily be spoofed (faked) so anyone who gets a call which they are suspicious about is advised not to give any information but to tell the caller to write to them as they will have all their personal details.

The Telephone Preference Service (TPS) is free and can help reduce the number of nuisance and scam calls you receive. To register, please visit: https://www.tpsonline.org.uk/register

More advice to help stop you from becoming a victim of fraud is below:

• If you believe you are being targeted by a scammer hang up the phone and use a different phone line to call Action Fraud or the police, as scammers have a way to stay on the line and will pretend to be the police when you call back.

• If you don't have access to a different phone line, wait for a period of time and try calling a family member or friend first to make sure the scammer is no longer on the line.

• Just because someone knows basic details about you like your address or date of birth, it doesn't mean they are genuine employees/callers.

• Always question suspicious phone calls and report them to Action Fraud or the police.

• Always have a pad and pen next to the phone, if you get a suspicious call, take details, don't get flustered, get names addresses and contact numbers then disconnect the call.

Anyone who believes they have been the victim of fraud can report this to police by calling 101 or calling Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.
