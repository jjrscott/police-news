Police in Cheltenham are warning residents to be wary of rogue traders operating in the area targeting elderly and vulnerable residents.

A number of incidents have been reported of a company canvassing streets and delivering a service which they overcharge for.

One incident took place on 17 February when men conned an elderly resident out of £720 to chop branches off a tree. They claimed to work for Gloucestershire County Council and left after approximately 20 minutes of work.

Another incident was reported the following day where the same men canvassed on Fleckers Drive and caused £1500 of damage to a vulnerable man's roof before providing a quote to return and fix the damage caused.

They then left and continued down the street asking other residents for large sums of money for work which wasn't required.

The men were described as being white and in their late twenties or early thirties.

One was 6ft tall, of a round/plump build, with short dark brown messy hair, shaved sides and dark brown facial hair.

He was believed to be the leader of the group and wore a bright blue hoodie which had "Skyline" written on the back.

The other man was approximately 5ft 10, of a medium build, had longer messy dark brown hair and patchy facial hair.

It is reported there were approximately five men who operated out of two white vans.

Officers are asking anyone who has recognises the men pictured, thinks they have been a victim of this or who has any information to get in contact.

This can be done by competing the following online form and referencing CR/06671/21: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report or by calling 101.

Trading Standards advice is to:

• Never agree to have work done or part with money on your doorstep.

• Always get written quotes from at least two traders for any work.

• Always agree a price/payment arrangements along with start and finish dates in writing before any work starts.

• Remember that you don't have to pay in full until you're completely satisfied with the work.

If you think you have been the victim of fraud then please ring 101 or 999 if the offenders are still in the area.
