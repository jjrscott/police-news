Three people were arrested yesterday (Monday) after a large quantity of Cannabis was found in Stonehouse.

Officers who were out on patrol proactively stopped a vehicle after it was found to have no number plate before searching the individuals and finding a quantity of cannabis wraps on them.

The group fled from officers and were located at a nearby property where officers then went on to find a larger quantity of Cannabis in a shed.

A 19-year-old man from Stonehouse was arrested on suspicion of the supply of class B drugs and driving whilst under the influence.

Two women, also from Stonehouse and aged 21 and 23 were also arrested on suspicion of the supply of class B drugs.

They remain in custody at this time.
