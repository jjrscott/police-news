Thousands of pounds worth of model trains and cars have been stolen from the home of an elderly men in Hardwicke.

At some time between 6pm on New Year's Eve and 11.15am the following day unknown offenders forced entry to the property on Elmgrove Road East.

The victim, aged in his 80s, has spent years accumulating the collection of Rolls-Royce Franklin Mint Precision models and Bachmann Brassworks locomotives.

Jewellery was also stolen in the burglary and officers are appealing for anyone who has seen these items for sale, or has any information which could help with enquiries, to contact police.

Information can be given by calling Gloucestershire Constabulary on 101 and referencing incident 298 of 1 January.
