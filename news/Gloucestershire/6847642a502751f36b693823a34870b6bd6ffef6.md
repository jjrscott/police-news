We've issued an appeal to locate 38-year-old Ezekiel Foster who is wanted in connection with drugs supply offences.

Foster has no fixed address but is known to frequent Gloucester, including the Tredworth area.

He is described as a black man, of a stocky build, is 5ft 5ins tall and clean shaven.

Anyone who has information on Foster's whereabouts, or sees him, is asked not to approach but to call police on 101 and reference crime 38281/19.
