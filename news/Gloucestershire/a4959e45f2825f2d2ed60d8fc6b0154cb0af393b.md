A man has been sentenced following an investigation into a burglary in Cheltenham earlier this year.

Terrence White, 43 and of Sussex Avenue appeared at Gloucester Crown Court last week where he was sentenced to two years and four months in prison.

Police were called to Buckingham Avenue in Rowanfield on 15 January after it was reported that a member of the public had seen a man break into a property.

Officers from the Cheltenham Neighbourhood Policing Team attended and located White nearby before seizing an electric bicycle from him as it was suspected to have been stolen.

White was subsequently charged with dwelling burglary and theft and pleaded guilty to the offences last month. The seized bicycle will be returned to its rightful owner in due course.

Investigating Officer Bethany Philpott said: "Terrence White has been known to cause issues in Cheltenham after previously committing burglaries.

"We most recently became aware of his offending after an incident in Rowanfield which caused a lot of concern for the local community.

"The Cheltenham Neighbourhood Policing Team were great in responding to the public's concerns and I am pleased that White has been convicted and will now not be offending for a while.

"I hope that this sentencing shows our commitment to tackling burglary and bicycle theft."
