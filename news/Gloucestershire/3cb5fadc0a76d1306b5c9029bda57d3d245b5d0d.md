Police are appealing for witnesses to an attempted burglary which took place at a housing development site in Brockworth earlier this week.

At around 8pm on Monday, a member of the public spotted a suspicious looking car driving up De Havilland's Gardens close to a local housing development.

It was reported that the occupants of the small black car attempted to gain access to a porta-cabin on the site.

They did not gain access and drove off in the direction of Peregrine Road.

CCTV enquiries show that a number of dog walkers were in the area at the time and anyone who witnessed this or has information on the offenders or their vehicle is asked to call 101 quoting incident 434 of 2 November or submit it online at: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/contact/af/contact-us/us/a-crime-that-has-already-been-reported/
