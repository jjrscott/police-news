Officers from the Cheltenham Neighbourhood Policing Team are trying to locate the owners of a number of seized bikes that are believed to have been stolen.

11 bikes have been seized so far this week as part of Operation Zodiac which was launched following a recent spate of bicycle thefts and officers would like to return them to the rightful owners.

Sergeant Steve Benbow said: "We have put extra patrols into place due to an increase in the theft of bicycles in Cheltenham in a bid to reduce offences and identify any potential offenders.

"The team have been running the operation this week and I would like to reassure the public that we are working hard to identify the offenders who commit these offences.

"As well as Operation Zodiac we are also running a number of crime prevention events and bicycle marking initiatives to help prevent these crimes from happening.

"Last week, officers held a marking event on the High Street which saw 73 bicycles being security marked and 40 coding kits being given out.

"Further events are taking place at Charlton Kings Library from 10am to 2pm tomorrow (Saturday 11 July) and Cheltenham Lido from 10am to 3pm on Saturday 25 July and I encourage bike owners to come along."

Anyone who recognises a bike is asked to call 101 quoting incident 270 of 9 July or submit information via our online form: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/
