Officers are appealing for witnesses to a burglary which took place in Gloucester last week.

Police were called to Stroud Road last Tuesday evening (18 February) following reports that four stocky men had gained entry to a property before stealing jewellery from inside.

It was reported that the men forced entry to the house at around 6.20pm before locating the jewellery and being disturbed by the homeowner.

The men, who were wearing dark clothing and face coverings, then left via the front door and ran along Stroud Road.

Anyone who was in the area at the time, has dashcam/CCTV footage or saw the men is asked to call 101 with incident number 349 of 18 February.
