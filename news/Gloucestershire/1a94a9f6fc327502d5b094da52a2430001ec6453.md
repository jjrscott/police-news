We would like to speak to the owner of two female dogs, believed to be Bull Mastiffs, which were seized by officers last week.

Police were called to Matson Lane in Gloucester at around 1.55am on Sunday (1 Dec) where it was reported that the two dogs had attacked a Jack Russell Chihuahua cross.

The dogs were seized as the owner could not be found and officers are asking for them to come forward so that the dogs can be returned.

It was reported that the two dogs, which were loose, had attacked the victim's dog and that the owner sustained hand injuries whilst separating them.

If you own the dogs or know who they belong to please call 101 quoting incident number 43 of 1 December.
