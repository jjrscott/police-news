Officers are appealing for witnesses after a trailer was stolen from Slimbridge earlier this month.

Police were called to Moorend Lane in Slimbridge at 9.30am on Saturday 6 February where it was reported that an Ifor Williams trailer and farm equipment had been stolen overnight.

It is believed that this took place between 8.30pm and 11.30pm the night before (Friday 5 February) and that offenders accessed the site by travelling along Station Road in Berkeley, Halmore Lane and Riddle Street in Purton, Slimbridge Lane, Tyndale Road and Moorend Lane in Slimbridge before doing the same in reverse.

The trailer was found abandoned four miles away on a road in Berkeley along with a car, both of which have been seized for forensic enquiries to take place.

Investigating officers are asking anyone who lives in the area and witnessed this taking place or who may have CCTV footage to get in contact quoting incident 138 of 6 February.

This can be done by completing the following online form or calling 101: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report
