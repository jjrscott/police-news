A man has been remanded in police custody after being charged with drugs offences.

Benjamin Theyer, 31 and of Millbrook Street in Cheltenham was arrested on suspicion of the supply of class A drugs yesterday afternoon (Tuesday) after officers found a quantity of drugs in his possession.

This morning (Wednesday), Theyer was charged with possession with intent to supply a controlled class A drug and is due to appear in court later today.

Investigating officers executed a warrant to search Theyer's home address and a quantity of crack cocaine was seized as part of the investigation.
