Police are appealing for information following an unprovoked assault on Cleeve Common last month.

A man aged in his 50s was stood outside a parked car in a layby on Aggs Hill on Tuesday 8 September when he was approached by four unknown men.

The incident happened around 9.20pm where two of the men assaulted the victim by pushing him into the car door and punching him in the side of his head.

Nothing was stolen during the incident however one of the offenders shouted about "recording".

Investigating officers believe the offenders may have misconstrued the victim's actions, as he was using radio equipment to listen to broadcasts due to doing amateur radio/ham radio.

After the assault the four men left the scene together in a Land Rover.

Anyone with information is asked to submit this online by completing the update a crime report form on the Constabulary's website here https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/ quoting incident 2 of 9 September.

You can also call police on 101.
