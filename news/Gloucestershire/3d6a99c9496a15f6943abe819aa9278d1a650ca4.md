Officers are appealing for witnesses after a woman had her vehicle damaged while she was parked in Winfield Hospital, Longford.

At around 2pm yesterday (Wednesday 18th March) police were called to a report of criminal damage in which three young men had damaged a red van that was parked at the back of car park.

It was reported that the group attempted to open the back door of the van but it was locked as the driver was sat inside at the time. They then went on to smash the drivers window before running off.

They were described as being teenagers, wearing black or black and white tracksuits and with one of them wearing a red hat.

Officers are asking anyone who witnessed the incident or anything suspicious to contact police on 101 quoting incident 186 of 18 March.

Alternatively, information can also be submitted to police by using the 'update a crime report' form on the Constabulary's website: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/

You can also give information to independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
