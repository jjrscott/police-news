A man from Cheltenham has given a guilty plea after being charged with burglary and fraud offences.

26-year-old Mason McConnon of Vittoria Walk was arrested on Thursday (19 March) before being charged with three counts of fraud by false representation, two counts of dwelling burglary and theft and one count of dwelling burglary with intent to steal.

He gave the plea at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court this morning and was remanded to appear at Gloucester Crown Court on Friday 23 April.

The charges relate to incidents which took place in a number of areas of Cheltenham last week.
