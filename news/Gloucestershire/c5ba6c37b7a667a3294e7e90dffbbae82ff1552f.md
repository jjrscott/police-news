Officers from the Cheltenham Neighbourhood Policing Team contributed over 200 hours of patrols last week as part of Operation Lift.

The operation took place from Monday to Sunday (15 to 21 June) as part of the reopening of non-essential shops.

Officers conducted hi-visibility patrols in the town centre and at local retail parks to reassure the public, reduce any potential offending and encourage engagement following the easing of government guidelines around shopping.

The operation saw a number of positive outcomes such as a noticeable reduction in reports of anti-social behaviour and the seizure of a vehicle after the owner was seen to be driving anti-socially on Tuesday (16 June).

The Community Engagement Vehicle was also in the town centre from Monday to Thursday and officers answered questions and concerns from around 250 members of public as well as providing support where needed.

Sergeant Steve Benbow said: "The operation was well received by our partner agencies and the public with numerous comments being made about the visibility of officers who were on patrol in the town centre.

"We ran this operation to provide reassurance to the public, reduce any potential offending and encourage engagement and the neighbourhood team were able to demonstrate this thanks to the effectiveness of partnership working.

"I would like to thank everyone who worked alongside us for helping to make the operation a success."
