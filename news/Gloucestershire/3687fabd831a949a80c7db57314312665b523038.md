Officers are appealing for witnesses after a woman was inappropriately touched in Gloucester last weekend

It was reported that a woman was walking from Great Western Road through the underpass towards Gloucester train station at around 5.25pm last Saturday (8 February).

It is believed that a man who was walking in the opposite direction smiled and laughed as he walked past before inappropriately touching the woman.

He was described as being a white man with long brown hair and a goatee style beard. He was wearing a burgundy crew neck jumper, grey/black work trousers, beige boots and was carrying a backpack over his right shoulder.

A number of people were in the area at the time and anyone who saw this taking place or has information is asked to call 101 quoting incident 174 of 8 February.
