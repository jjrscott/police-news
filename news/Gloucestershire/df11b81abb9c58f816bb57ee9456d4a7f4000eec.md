Three women from Cheltenham have been charged with shoplifting after being arrested yesterday morning (Monday 14 December).

Jade Stevens, 30yo of Ashlands Road was charged with seven counts of theft from a shop, Cerise Theyer, 33yo of Pates Avenue was charged with six counts of theft from a shop and Victoria Wakeley-Jones, 23yo of Mount View Drive was charged with one count of theft from a shop.

They have been released on police bail to appear at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court on 12 March 2021.
