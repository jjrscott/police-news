A man was arrested by officers from the Tewkesbury Neighbourhood Policing Team yesterday (Monday) in connection with burglaries at businesses over the weekend.

Officers were called by a number of businesses in the town centre on Sunday (26 July) who reported that someone had forced entry before conducting searches and stealing a number of items from inside.

A 33-year-old man from Cheltenham was arrested on suspicion of burglary and has since been released under investigation pending further enquiries. **â€‹**

The arrest was a result of CCTV enquiries that were conducted by investigating officers.
