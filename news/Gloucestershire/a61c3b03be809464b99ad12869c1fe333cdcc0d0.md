Gloucestershire Constabulary has released pictures of suspected stolen jewellery in a bid to return it to the rightful owners.

Officers recovered the items last month after they had been discarded following a pursuit of a vehicle which failed to stop for police in Cheltenham.

The items, which include rings, watches and a set of car keys were seized and investigating officers believe they may have been stolen some time prior to the incident on 19 February.

A 25-year-old man from Cheltenham was arrested on suspicion of burglary and was later released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Anyone who recognises the items pictured below or knows who they belong to is asked to please call police on 101 quoting incident number 98 of 19 February.

Alternatively information can be submitted online through the Constabulary's website and the update a crime report, quote the incident number: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/
