Officers in Cheltenham are warning residents to be vigilant after a number of reports of shed and garage break-ins or attempts this week.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, six burglaries or attempted burglaries of sheds and garages were reported.

The first incident was reported on Swindon Street on Tuesday after a resident had disturbed someone who was trying to gain access to the rear of their property.

This took place last Friday (12 June) and the offenders did not steal anything on this occasion.

The second incident was reported on Montpellier Parade on Tuesday after offenders forced entry to a garage before stealing a hybrid racing bicycle and searching the victim's car.

This is believed to have taken place between Saturday afternoon and Sunday evening (13/14 June).

The third reported incident took place on St James' Walk at 12.50am on Wednesday after two men were seen to be attempting to break into a garage.

The fourth incident took place on Naunton Park Road overnight on Wednesday after offenders forced entry to a garage before stealing a mountain bike, chain saw and drill.

The fifth incident was reported on Laxton Road on Wednesday when a homeowner reported that offenders had broken into their shed before stealing fishing equipment and a bicycle.

A further three incidents were also reported on Wednesday after three sheds at the allotments behind Leckhampton Primary School were broken into.

This took place overnight on Tuesday and it is currently unknown if anything was stolen.

Inspector Rich Smith said: "Criminals are often opportunistic and will target locations where they can offend whilst going unnoticed.

"I am urging residents to please ensure that their homes and sheds/garages are locked when unattended and to remove any valuable items

"My team will be conducting proactive patrols across the town and will be available to speak to anyone who has concerns as well as working with colleagues from other departments to provide the fullest response in terms of prevention, reassurance and detection."

Homeowners are advised to install a 'WIDE' combination of security devices as well ensuring that back gates are secure. Advice on how to protect your shed, garage and outhouse can be found here: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/cp/crime-prevention/non-residential-burglary/secure-shed-garage/
