Two men have been charged with drugs offences following the proactive work of officers from our Force Crime Operations Team.

Usama Mohamed Hassan, aged 28 and of St Georges Road in Cheltenham and Karl Bruton, aged 57 and of Tetbury Road in Cirencester were arrested after officers witnessed what they believed to be a drug deal between the two men yesterday.

Hassan was subsequently charged with possession of criminal property and being concerned in the supply of both cocaine and heroin whilst Bruton was charged with possession of a class A drug.

Hassan was remanded in custody to appear at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court today and Bruton was bailed to appear at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court on Monday 17 February.

The charges relate to the arrests of Hassan and Bruton and subsequent searches which saw officers recover a quantity of drugs and money.
