Gloucestershire Constabulary is warning local contractors to be alert following burglaries at building sites in the county.

A number of burglaries have been reported at sites in the past two weeks with items such as tools and appliances being stolen.

One of the incidents was reported at a building site in Hardwicke on Sunday 7 June after offenders gained entry before entering eight properties and stealing gas boilers from inside.

This is reported to have taken place at around 3am on the day and CCTV footage shows a man in the area who had short blonde hair and was wearing an orange coat, white trainers and carrying a rucksack.

Another burglary was reported to have taken place at a property in Gloucester which is currently under renovation.

It is believed that offenders forced entry at some point between 4.30pm on Friday 5 June and 8am on Monday 8 June before searching the property and stealing two petrol disc cutters, a concrete breaker, battery operated drills and hand tools.

A further incident was reported at a building site in Standish near Stonehouse on Friday 12 June and it is believed that offenders gained entry overnight before forcing their way into five properties and stealing items from inside.

It was reported that three Valiant Boilers, five Flue Adaptors, three Bosch 60cm cooker ovens and three gas hobs were stolen. Ten windows and doors were also damaged during the burglary and radiators were drained to allow for the boilers to be taken.

Anyone who witnessed the incidents, suspicious activity or has CCTV footage is asked to call 101 with one of the following incident numbers:

 * Incident 70 of 7 June- building site in Hardwicke
 * Incident 126 of 7 June- house under renovation in Gloucester
 * Incident 56 of 12 June- building site in Standish near Stonehouse
