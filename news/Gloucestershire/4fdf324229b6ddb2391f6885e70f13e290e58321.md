A cyclist suffered serious injuries in a collision in Tewkesbury yesterday (Wednesday 5 February) and we're appealing for those who helped to come forward.

The cyclist had been on the Gupshill roundabout on the A38 Gloucester bound at around 11am when there was a collision with a vehicle, possibly a black car. The vehicle did not stop at the scene and we're keen to identify it.

The man, aged in his 70s, sustained serious injuries and was kindly helped by a woman in a grey pick-up type vehicle who stopped to assist.

Officers would like this woman, and anyone else who stopped at the scene, to contact police as they may have information which could help the investigation.

The injured man later went to hospital where he remained overnight. His injuries are not believed to be life threatening.

The woman who helped, or any witnesses who have information about the collision or who have dashcam footage, are asked to call police on 101 and quote incident 379 of 5 February.

Information can also be submitted to us online through the 'update a crime report' form on our website: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/
