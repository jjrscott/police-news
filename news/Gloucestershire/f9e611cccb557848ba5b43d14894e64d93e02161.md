A former Chief Fire Officer has been charged via way of postal requisition to appear in court in connection with an allegation of fraud by abuse of position.

Stewart Edgar, 52 and of Braehead Drive, Carnoustie, Angus in Scotland is due to appear at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 10 March.

The charge follows consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service after an investigation by Gloucestershire Constabulary into the alleged sale of a Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service Land Rover in April 2018.
