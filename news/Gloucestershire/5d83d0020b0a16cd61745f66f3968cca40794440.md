Two teenagers were arrested on suspicion of the theft of a moped last night thanks to a quick thinking member of the public who reported seeing suspicious activity.

Police were called to Laxton Walk in Cheltenham shortly after 10.45pm yesterday after a resident had seen four youths take a moped from the drive of a property before pushing it down the road.

Officers attended and two teenagers, aged 16 and 17 were located nearby before being arrested on suspicion of the theft of a motor vehicle.

The moped has been recovered by officers and will be returned to the owner in due course.

They remain in police custody today and anyone with information who hasn't yet spoken to police is asked to call 101 quoting incident 462 of 4 August.
