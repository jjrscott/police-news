Last month officers from our Force Crime Operations team issued a photo album to identify the rightful owners of seized items that are suspected to have been stolen.

Investigating officers are now trying to identify over 250 additional items which include paintings, jewellery, silverware, pottery and furniture amongst other items.

Members of the public are asked to please take a look at the album and let police know if they recognise any of the items or know who they may belong to.

Anyone who recognises something is asked to submit information via our online form referencing incident 81 of 1 April and include a description of the item/items: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/

Information can also be submitted by calling 101 and quoting incident 81 of 1 April.

Note- we have been unable to add the photos due to the number of them but a Facebook album can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/129004250495/posts/10157342947065496
