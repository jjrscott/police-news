Officers in Cheltenham are appealing for information following a number of reports of lewd acts being committed in St Peters Park/St Moors Park in the past week.

The first incident was reported to have happened at around 6.30pm last Tuesday (17 March) when a member of the public reported seeing a man masturbating.

The man, who was described as being white, tall and slim, was stood amongst trees along the stream that backs onto Moors Avenue.

The second incident was called in to police shortly after 3.30pm on Monday (23 March) after a man was seen to be exposing himself earlier in the day.

It was reported that the man was stood in the park near to the Shell Garage and was described as being white, in his 20s-30s and was wearing a dark coloured hoodie with white trainers.

The third incident was reported to have taken place again by the stream that backs onto Moors Avenue at around 3pm on Monday (23 March) when a man, described as being white, in his 30s to 40s and of an average build, was seen to be masturbating.

He is believed to be around 5ft 11ins tall and had dark trousers/jeans which were around his ankles.

Acting Sergeant Ed Garlick from the Cheltenham Neighbourhood Policing Team said: "It is not yet known if these acts were committed by the same man and I would like to ask anyone who has information to let us know.

"I understand that incidents like this can be alarming for members of the public who are going about their days and anyone who has photographs or footage that identifies the individual/s involved is asked to submit this to us.

"I would also urge anyone who witnesses similar acts in the future to report this to the team so that we can take part in patrols of these areas."

Anyone with information is asked to report this by calling 101 quoting one of the below incident numbers:

 * Incident 307 of 17 March- Stream backing onto Moors Avenue
 * Incident 214 of 23 March- Near to Shell Garage on PE Way
 * Incident 232 of 23 March- Stream backing onto Moors Avenue
