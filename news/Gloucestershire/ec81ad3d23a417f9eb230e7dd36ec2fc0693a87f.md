Officers are appealing for witnesses and dashcam footage following a fatal collision on the A436 near Cheltenham yesterday, Sunday 26 January.

We were called to the A436 near Seven Springs at 8.36am following reports of a collision involving a grey Volkswagen Polo and a blue Vauxhall Insignia estate.

This took place between the Seven Springs roundabout and the A40 at Andoversford, close to the large lay-by at the bottom of the intersection for the A436 and A435.

The driver of the Volkswagen Polo, a woman in her 30s and from Oxfordshire, sustained serious injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene. Her next of kin have been informed.

The occupants of the Vauxhall Insignia sustained injuries and were taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital for treatment.

It is believed that the Volkswagen was travelling from the double roundabouts at Seven Springs towards the A40 at Andoversford when the collision took place and that the Vauxhall was travelling in the opposite direction.

Collision investigators would like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed what happened, or who has relevant dashcam footage and has not already spoken to police.

Officers would also like to speak to anyone who may have been walking along the Cotswold Way footpath at around 8.30am yesterday or anyone parked in a lay-by near to where the collision happened.

Anyone witnesses, or anyone with information, is asked to call police on 101 quoting incident 117 of 26 January.
