Gloucestershire Constabulary recognises the work of all our staff who respond when people need us - whether that's taking calls, attending incidents and crimes or addressing neighbourhood concerns and wider policing issues.

That's why we support the National Police Chiefs Council's Response Policing Wellbeing and Recognition Week of Action, which aims to highlight specifically the challenges faced by those officers who are often the first to arrive at a scene.

Dealing with potentially difficult or dangerous situations while keeping people safe from harm, carrying out duties to the best of our ability and keeping the victim at the centre of our thoughts can be both physically and mentally draining - and Covid has added another dimension to this.

Officers never know what situations they will be faced with when they come into work each day. They have to be prepared to handle a wide range of incidents, including complex and sometimes confrontational situations.

So this week, on top of the support we usually offer to officers internally, we'll be promoting a range of resources available from the NPCC and other national bodies.

A huge thanks to all our officers who respond to incidents, and all our staff who respond to demand more broadly.
