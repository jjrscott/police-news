Gloucestershire Constabulary is appealing for witnesses to a collision in Stow-on-the-Wold in the early hours of this morning, Tuesday 24 December.

At approximately 1.15am there was a collision involving a pedestrian and a green Volkswagen Golf on the A436 Oddington Road, near to the King Georges Field junction.

The pedestrian, a man aged in his 20s, sustained a broken leg and was taken to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford for treatment.

Road closures were put in place while emergency services were at the scene and these have since been lifted.

Police are appealing for anyone who saw the man prior to the collision, or who saw the collision take place, to call 101 and quote incident 27 of 24 December.
