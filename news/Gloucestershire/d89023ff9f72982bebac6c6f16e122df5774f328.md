A man was arrested by officers from the Cheltenham Neighbourhood Policing Team yesterday (Wednesday) following intelligence that had been gathered on drug dealing.

Officers were patrolling in the Arle area last night when they stopped the man, who was acting suspiciously, before finding a quantity of cannabis, mobile phones and a quantity of cash in his possession.

A further search was conducted at an address linked to the man and a bicycle that was suspected to have been stolen and a quantity of cocaine was recovered.

The 20-year-old who is from Cheltenham was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A and B drugs as well as theft of a bicycle.

He remains in police custody today (Thursday) pending further enquiries.
