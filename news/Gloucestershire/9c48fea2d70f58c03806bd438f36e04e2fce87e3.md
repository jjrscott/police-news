A man is due in court today, Wednesday 26 February, charged with causing criminal damage to eight police cars and theft of a cash machine in the Cotswolds.

In the early hours of Saturday 9 November, 2019 officers responding to a report of a burglary at a garage in Moreton-in-Marsh found that tyres on vehicles parked at Stow-on-the-Wold police station had been slashed.

Officers from the Force Response Unit and Crime Operations team, who were on patrol in the area, attended the burglary and found that the cash machine and a number of cash cassettes had been stolen.

Frankie Butler, 29, was arrested in Worcestershire yesterday (Tuesday 25 February) in connection with the incidents.

A 30-year-old man was also arrested in connection with the incidents.

Butler, of Pershore Lane, Hindlip, Worcester was remanded in custody overnight to appear before magistrates in Cheltenham today.

The 30-year-old man, also from Worcestershire, has been released under investigation pending further inquiries.
