Officers arrested four men following a burglary at a shop in Longford on Thursday night (2 April).

Police were called to a report of a break-in at the Co-op on Longford Lane at around 11.30pm.

Offenders had forced entry and stolen a number of cigarettes and alcohol products.

Officers were able to locate the offending vehicle and two men, aged 59 and 32 and both from Gloucester, were arrested as they ran through residential gardens.

A further two suspects, a 52-year-old man and a 18-year-old man, both from Gloucester, were arrested the next day at an address in Churchdown where the stolen goods as well as a stolen vehicle believed to be used in the commission of the offence were recovered.

All four men were arrested on suspicion of burglary offences and have been bailed to return to police on dates at the end of April or beginning of May.

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has information and has not already spoken to police, is asked to call 101 quoting incident 441 of 2 April.
