Officers investigating an incident of racial abuse are appealing to identify two potential victims.

Police were called to Watermint Drive in Tuffley shortly after 3.50pm last Thursday (25 February) in connection with an assault by a man on two women.

Upon attendance it was reported that the man had also shouted racist abuse to a passer-by and made racist comments to a woman who attempted to help.

Investigating officers have been unable to identify those who had racial abuse aimed at them and are asking them to come forward.

This can be done by calling 101 or completing the following online form and referencing incident 333 of 25 February: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report

A 24-year-old man from Gloucester was arrested and charged in connection with the assaults on the women and in connection with assaults on officers who attended the incident. He will be appearing at Gloucester Crown Court on Monday 22 March.
