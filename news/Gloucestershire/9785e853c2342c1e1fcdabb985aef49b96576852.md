Officers seized cannabis, money and drug related paraphernalia after executing a drugs warrant at a property in Prestbury yesterday (Tuesday).

The Cheltenham Neighbourhood Policing and Force Crime Operations teams obtained and executed the warrant after information was gathered about suspected drug dealing from the property.

A 25-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of the supply of class B drugs and has since been released under investigation whilst further enquiries are conducted.

Sergeant Julia Martin-Jones said: "dealing drugs in our communities will not be tolerated and I am pleased that we have been able to prevent the cannabis that we seized from getting into the wrong hands.

"Anyone who has concerns or information about drug dealing that they would like to make us aware of is asked to complete the following online form: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/a/your-area/local-policing-team-contact/contact-your-local-policing-team."
