Our officers are working with colleagues from other agencies to monitor and respond to flooding in the county today.

We're working with @GlosRoads to put signage in place for roads closed due to flooding but please bear with us as demand is high.

We have had a number of reports of people removing signs and driving through the water - please do not do this.

Appropriate advice when driving on roads that aren't closed but affected by flooding can be found here: https://www.theaa.com/…/seasonal/driving-through-flood-water

A number of flood warnings and alerts remain in place in the county this morning. Latest picture can be found here: https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/warnings

If you have been flooded, remember that accidents happen in fast flowing floodwater so avoid walking or driving in or near floodwater. Take care if you must go into flood water as there could be hidden dangers like sharp objects, raised manhole covers and pollution. Also wash your hands regularly and do not eat food that has touched flood water.

When cleaning up after a flood, ensure good ventilation if using portable indoor appliances to dry out rooms. The exhaust fumes from such generators can contain carbon monoxide which can kill in a confined space such as a home. Never use outdoor generators indoors even in the event of a power cut. Also, remember not to turn on gas or electrics until they have been checked by a qualified technician, and check with your local water company if you notice a change in your water.
