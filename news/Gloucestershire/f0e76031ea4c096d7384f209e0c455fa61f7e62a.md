Officers from the Cheltenham Neighbourhood Policing Teams are asking dog owners and walkers to remain vigilant following recent reports of harmful food and items being left in parks.

A member of the public contacted police on Saturday (9 January) after they had found roughly four kilograms of raisins (which are harmful to dogs) dumped within Queen Elizabeth II park on Saxon Way, Charlton Kings.

The food was found at the edge of the dog walking path near to the car park and is harmful to dogs if digested, officers have fortunately not received any reports of dogs digesting the raisins.

Officers have also received a number of reports of food with knives inside being found in the Pittville area over the past month.

At this time officers believe that the items were left on purpose and are asking dog walkers to be vigilant of any food or other items that their dogs may approach.

Anyone who has information is asked to submit this by completing the following online form: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/a/your-area/local-policing-team-contact/contact-your-local-policing-team

Alternatively you can call 101 or 999 if it is an emergency.
