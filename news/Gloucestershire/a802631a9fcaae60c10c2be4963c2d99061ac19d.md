Police are reminding residents to please be vigilant following a number of reports of thefts from motor vehicles over the weekend.

Between Friday and Monday (4 to 7 Sept), 17 incidents were reported with these taking place in all areas of the county.

It's believed that these crimes were committed overnight whilst vehicles were parked on driveways or on public roads and the incidents are broken down as follows:

• 8 in Cheltenham

• 3 in Gloucester

• 1 in Stroud

• 1 in Tewkesbury

• 1 in the Forest of Dean

• 3 in the Cotswolds

Officers are asking the public to please check that car doors are locked and that personal belongings/valuables are removed from vehicles where possible as a lot of incidents can be opportunistic with unlocked vehicles being entered and searched.

Items that have been stolen include Sat Navs, sunglasses, change and bank cards.

Anyone who witnesses suspicious activity or is targeted by a vehicle break-in is asked to call 101 or 999 if a crime is in progress.
