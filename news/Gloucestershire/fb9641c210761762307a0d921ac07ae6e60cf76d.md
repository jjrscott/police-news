Officers are appealing for witnesses to an assault which took place in Cheltenham over the weekend.

Police were called to the Lower High Street on Saturday afternoon (22 February) following reports that a teenage girl had been assaulted.

It was reported that the victim was walking along the road at around 2.30pm when she was approached by another teenager before being punched, pushed into a wall and having her hair pulled.

Two women intervened before helping the victim and officers would like to speak to them as they may be able to help with their investigation.

If you were the women who helped or were in the area at the time and witnessed this taking place please call 101 quoting incident 274 of 22 February.
