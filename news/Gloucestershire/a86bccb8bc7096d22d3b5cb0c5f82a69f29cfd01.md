Members of the public are being asked to report any suspicious looking vehicles that they see driving in the early hours of the morning.

It follows the theft of four 4x4 vehicles across the county overnight between 10.30pm on Sunday 3 May and 2am on Monday 4 May.

The incidents took place in Gloucester, Cotswolds and Tewkesbury.

It was reported that a dark blue vehicle - possibly a BMW or Mercedes - was seen in the areas at the time of the thefts.

Gloucestershire Constabulary is now asking people to let them know if they see any suspicious cars on the road overnight.

Detective Superintendent Steve Bean said: "It is unlikely that any vehicle with multiple occupants that is driving in the small hours of the morning will be doing so for essential travel or because they are key workers.

"I would ask that anybody who has seen a vehicle with multiple occupants who they do not recognise, driving in their area overnight, reports it to us."

Anyone with information can report this to police by calling 101 and quoting incident 318 of 7 May.
