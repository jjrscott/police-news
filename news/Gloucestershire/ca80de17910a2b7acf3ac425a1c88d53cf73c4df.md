One lane has reopened past the scene of a serious collision that took place on the M5 northbound near Quedgeley this morning.

Two cars collided between junction 12 and junction 11A at around 8.10am today (Thursday 2 January).

The air ambulance attended but a Gloucester woman was declared dead a short time later.

Her next of kin has been informed.

The driver of the other vehicle suffered non-serious injuries.

Two lanes of the northbound carriageway remain closed past the scene while a serious collision investigation takes place and the junction 12 entry slip road for the Northbound carriageway is also still closed.

The southbound carriageway is open.

Any witnesses who haven't yet contacted police should call 101 and quote incident 67 of 2 January.
