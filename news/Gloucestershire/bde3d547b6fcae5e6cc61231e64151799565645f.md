Officers investigating a distraction theft at a supermarket in Cheltenham have issued CCTV images of a man they would like to speak to in connection with the incident.

Police received a report that an elderly woman's handbag had been stolen whilst she was shopping at Tesco's on Colletts Drive.

It was reported that the woman was shopping with her handbag placed inside of a trolley when she was stopped by a man who started asking her questions.

The woman began a conversation with the man when a child who is believed to have been with him grabbed her bag before running out of the supermarket.

The man followed the child and also left the supermarket.

This is reported to have taken place on the afternoon of Saturday 22 February

Officers have conducted a number of enquiries but have been unable to identify the man pictured and anyone who recognises him is asked to call police on 101 and quote incident 327 of 22 February.
