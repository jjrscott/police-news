A Cheltenham man has been sentenced after pleading guilty to two burglaries that he was linked to following forensic enquiries.

Jonjo Thompson, 28 and of Wymans Road appeared at Gloucester Crown Court on Friday (24 January) where he was sentenced to two years and four months in prison.

Police were called to Highfield Road in Lydney at the end of August after a homeowner returned to find that their property had been broken into.

It was found that someone had gained entry before conducting an untidy search and stealing a large quantity of jewellery.

Officers noticed that a screwdriver had been discarded inside the house and this was seized by the Constabulary's Forensic Services team and resulted in the recovery of DNA linking Thompson to the incident.

Police were also called to a burglary on Apple Tree Close in Woodmancote on the afternoon of Thursday 27 October where the circumstances were very similar.

An untidy search had also been conducted and a number of items of sentimental jewellery were stolen.

Thompson was later forensically linked to the burglary after DNA matching his was recovered from a garden fork discarded within the scene.

The positive forensic matches led to a wanted appeal being issued for Thompson in mid-December and he was arrested a few days later, before being charged with both of the burglaries.

Crime Scene Coordinator Martin Cuffe said: "This is yet another excellent example of the joined up working within Gloucestershire Constabulary, and demonstrates our commitment to the investigation of burglary offences.

"The identification and recovery of the forensic evidence at the crime scenes, which linked Thompson to these offences; the work to bring Thompson into custody, and the extensive work of the investigating officers all contributed towards this successful prosecution and a custodial sentence for a prolific offender.

"This intervention will prevent Thompson from committing further offences, and in turn will help keep the people of Gloucestershire safe."

Crime Operations Detective Sergeant Darren Godwin said: "Breaking into someone's home and invading their privacy is an unspeakable crime and one that needs to be dealt with professionally and robustly.

"These charges and subsequent convictions will show Gloucestershire homeowners that we will leave no stone unturned to detect and bring the perpetrators to justice.

"With this sentence Thompson won't be in a position to cause anymore misery to the communities of Gloucestershire."
