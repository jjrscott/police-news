Due to an ongoing police investigation road closures and scene guards are in place on the A4136 between Monmouth and Coleford.

Shortly after 11.30pm last night, Tuesday 12 May, officers discovered suspected human remains.

Cordons are likely to remain in place for the rest of the day while enquiries continue to establish what has taken place and further forensic tests are being carried out on the remains.

A woman from Birmingham aged in her 20s and a man from Wolverhampton aged in his 30s have been arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with the investigation and remain in police custody today, Wednesday 13 May.
