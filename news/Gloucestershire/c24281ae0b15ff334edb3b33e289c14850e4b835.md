Three people are in police custody after two simultaneous drugs warrants were executed this morning (Thursday).

Officers from the Force Crime Operations, Support Group and police dogs teams conducted the warrants at properties in Hucclecote and Churchdown after intelligence had been gathered about suspected drug dealing at the addresses.

Three people from Gloucester; a 32-year-old woman, 35-year-old man and 32-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of the supply of class A drugs.

A quantity of cocaine was seized from both addresses as part of the investigation.
