A teenage boy has been arrested in connection with two knifepoint robberies in Gloucester over the past two days.

The first incident happened at a store on Eastern Avenue shortly before 11.15pm on Thursday 14 May.

Staff were threatened with a knife when the suspect got behind the counter and stole money from the till. He fled and despite a thorough search no-one was located.

Yesterday morning (Friday 15 May) police were alerted to a knifepoint robbery that was taking place at a store on Askwith Road at around 8.45am where money had been taken from the till.

Officers attended and with the support of the National Police Air Service a male was located and arrested in connection with the incident.

Hundreds of pounds worth of cash has been recovered as part of the investigation following searches which involved officers and their police dogs.

The teenager from Gloucester has been questioned in connection with both robberies and has since been released on police bail until 12 June.

Thankfully no-one was physically harmed in the incidents.

Anyone with information about either incident is asked to call police on 101 quoting 487 of 14 May for Eastern Avenue or 70 of 15 May for Askwith Road.

You can also give information anonymously to Crimestoppers by calling 0800 555 111.
