Wildlife officers are appealing for information after a swan was fatally injured in Over on Monday (27 April).

The swan was one of a pair nesting in reeds by the canal near the Wharf where a member of the public noticed that it had been injured and reported it to police shortly before 5.50pm.

The swan was taken to Vale Wildlife Hospital and Rehabilitation Centre, at Beckford, but its head injuries were so severe it had to be put to sleep.

Its partner was not injured but has abandoned the nest and their eggs are no longer viable.

Officers investigating this incident would like to hear from anyone who witnessed it or has any information about it.

Two teenage boys were seen nearby shortly before the swan was found and they may have information about the incident.

PC Cath McDay, wildlife officer for the Forest of Dean, said: "This is a very sad incident, and a meaningless act of violence.

"A beautiful bird has been killed and its chicks, which would have hatched soon, are believed to have died as well.

"We are keen to speak to anyone who may have information about this, especially the two teenage boys who were nearby at the time, and will do all we can to bring the offenders to justice.

"We are grateful to the Vale Wildlife Hospital for their help, trying to save the swan and providing us with information about its injuries."

Anyone with information is asked to call Gloucestershire Constabulary on 101 quoting incident 349 of 27 April.
