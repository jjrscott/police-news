A man sustained serious injuries following a two vehicle collision on the M5 this morning (Thursday 21 January).

Shortly after 8.45am emergency services responded to multiple reports of a collision on the southbound carriageway in lane one.

The incident happened between junction 13 (Stroud) and junction 14 (Falfield) and involved two large goods vehicles.

A man aged in his 50s and from Birmingham, who was driving one of the vehicles involved, suffered serious injuries and was taken to Southmead Hospital in Bristol.

The driver of the second vehicle was physically uninjured.

Officers from Gloucestershire Constabulary's forensic collision investigation unit attended the scene and the carriageway was closed.

No-one has been arrested in connection with the collision but investigating officers would like to speak to anyone who may have witnessed it or who may have dash-cam footage.

The Constabulary's Roads Policing Unit handed the management of the road closure and clean-up of the carriageway to Highways England south-west shortly before 3pm and the stretch of carriageway remained closed at that time.

Anyone who can assist with the investigation is asked to contact police online using the update a crime report form on the Force's website, referencing incident 77 of 21 January: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/
