The family of a woman who died in a collision on the M5 on Thursday 2 January has paid tribute to her.

Tracy Board, aged 51, died in a collision which happened between junction 12 and junction 11A northbound at around 8.10am.

Her family has said:

"Our beloved Tracy, 51, Daughter, Sister, Auntie and Great Auntie tragically passed away on January 2, 2020 during her usual commute to work.

"Tracy, originally from Cwmbran, South Wales who lived in Quedgeley, Gloucester worked in HMP Hewell. She was a Psychosocial Lead within the Substance Misuse, Drug and Alcohol team, which she truly adored.

"Her work was her life and if she wasn't working she was spending time with her family in Wales.
