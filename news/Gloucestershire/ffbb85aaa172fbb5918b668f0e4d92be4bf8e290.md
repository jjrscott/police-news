Four men have been arrested following a high profile policing operation in the Cirencester and Stroud areas this afternoon (Wednesday 22 January).

Just before 12.20pm police received report of a burglary at Western Computers in Cricklade Street, Cirencester where three valuable laptop computers had been stolen by a group of men who left the store and ran off down the street.

At some point they got into a grey VW Passat and made off.

Police officers on foot and in cars, as well as specialist dogs and a drone, were involved in the subsequent search which took place in Stroud, Harebushes, Painswick and the Salmon Springs estate.

Two men were arrested shortly before 1pm and the other two not long afterwards. They have all been taken into police custody.

A vehicle and the computers have been recovered.

Anyone with information about the incident should call Gloucestershire Constabulary on 101 quoting incident 156 of 22 January.
