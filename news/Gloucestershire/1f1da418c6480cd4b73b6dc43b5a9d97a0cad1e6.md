Police are appealing for information after a teenage girl suffered injuries when a piece of metal fell off a passing vehicle in Mile End, near Coleford on Thursday 3 September.

She had been walking along North Road, close to the junction of Woodville Avenue, at around 3.20pm when she was hit in the back with a large piece of metal reinforcement mesh which had fallen from a transit flatbed type truck.

The impact forced her over a garden wall and she required hospital treatment after suffering damage to her teeth as well as grazes on her face and body.

The vehicle was heading in the direction of Broadwell and police are keen to hear from the driver, anyone who witnessed the incident or vehicle or anyone who may have dashcam footage which could assist.
