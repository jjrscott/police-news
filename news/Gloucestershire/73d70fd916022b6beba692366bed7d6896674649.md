We're warning residents to be aware of a scam call where fraudsters are claiming to be from HM Revenue & Customs threatening arrest over unpaid taxes.

One woman in Stow-on-the-Wold was called this morning (Thursday 6 February) and told a warrant was out for her arrest and to press number one in order to speak to a police officer.

This is a common scam and thankfully the woman, aged in her 80s, was not tricked by the fraudsters.

This scam could have turned into a courier fraud and police are warning people to make their elderly or vulnerable friends, relatives and neighbours aware that this has happened today.

Fraudsters often choose a dialling code and target one area with numerous phone calls for a number of days before moving on to another location.

Anyone who receives a similar call should hang up the phone and do not follow their instructions. Police would not call someone for unpaid taxes, would never ask you to withdraw money from an account or ask you to hand over passwords or PIN numbers.

 * Neither police nor bank officials will ever ask you to withdraw money from your account, purchase anything or hand over your personal details or passwords.
 * If you believe you are being targeted by a scammer hang up the phone and use a different phone line to call Action Fraud or the police, as scammers have a way to stay on the line and will pretend to be the police when you call back.
 * If you don't have access to a different phone line, wait for a period of time and try calling a family member or friend first to make sure the scammer is no longer on the line.
 * Just because someone knows basic details about you like your address or date of birth, it doesn't mean they are genuine bank or police employees.
 * Always question suspicious phone calls and report them to Action Fraud or the police.

If you think you or someone you know has been defrauded, you can report it to Action Fraud online or by calling 0300 123 2040. For more advice about fraud please visit: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/advice/advice-and-information/fa/fraud/personal-fraud/
