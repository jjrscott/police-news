Officers are appealing for witnesses after a money box was stolen from a church in Gloucester on Boxing Day (26 December).

Police were called to St Peters Church on London Road shortly after 5.50am last Thursday where it was reported that a money box had been stolen from inside.

CCTV enquiries show that two teenagers forced entry to the church at around 4.10am before searching the nativity scene and leaving with the money box.

The youths are described as being white, around 5ft to 5ft 5ins tall and in their mid-teens.

One of them was wearing all black clothing with trainers which had white soles and the second was wearing a black coat, baseball cap with a white peak, red corduroy style trousers and dark coloured shoes.

Anyone who was in the area at the time or witnessed suspicious activity is asked to call 101 quoting incident 40 of 26 December.
