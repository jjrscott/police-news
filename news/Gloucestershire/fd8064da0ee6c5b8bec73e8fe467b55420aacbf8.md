A man has been arrested this afternoon (Thursday) in connection with incidents of indecent exposure at a park in Cinderford.

Police were called shortly before 2.25pm today after a man exposed himself to a woman in the park.

The Forest of Dean Neighbourhood Policing team had been doing a plain clothed operation in the area today in response to reports of similar incidents in Linear Park.

PCSOs and PCs had been patrolling the park at similar times to when incidents had previously been reported to police in recent days.

Following the call today police were able to quickly respond and a man started to run, however he was soon arrested.

Gloucestershire Constabulary issued a public appeal for information yesterday following two reports of a man exposing himself at the park on Sunday and Tuesday.

Similar incidents have also been reported since the appeal.

Forest of Dean Inspector Nick Cook said: "I'd like to praise the neighbourhood policing team for their quick response to these concerning incidents.

"We decided to do an intelligence-led plain clothed operation in the area today following reports we'd received from members of the public in the past few days.

"These types of crimes are alarming and I would like to thank those who have reported incidents to us which has enabled us to take action.

"If you have any information which could help the investigation please call us on 101 and quote incident 211 of 14 July or submit information to us online on our website."
