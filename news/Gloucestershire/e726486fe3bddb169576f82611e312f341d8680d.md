Officers investigating an incident at a Gloucester supermarket last month have issued CCTV images of a man they would like to identify.

Police were called to Tesco's on St Oswald's Road at around 8.10pm on Thursday 14 January following reports that a man had stolen a number of bottles of alcohol before threatening two security guards with a knife after they attempted to stop him from leaving.

The man ran away and attending officers were unable to locate him following the incident and that is why they are now appealing for help from the public.

Neither of the security guards were physically injured during the incident.

Investigating officers are asking anyone who recognises the man pictured or was in the supermarket at the time of the incident and has information to contact police by completing the following online form and referencing incident 469 of 14 January: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/

Information can also be submitted by calling 101 and quoting the same incident number.
