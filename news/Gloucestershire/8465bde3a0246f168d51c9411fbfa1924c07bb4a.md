Officers in the Forest of Dean are appealing for witnesses to an incident of dangerous driving which took place last week.

On Friday afternoon (31 July), it was reported that a car which was driving on the B4234 at Lydney East had been seen to dangerously overtake around 5/6 vehicles whilst on a bendy stretch of the road.

This is believed to have taken place at 2.50pm whilst travelling out of Lydney and involved a silver/grey car, possibly an Astra, which had a number of occupants inside at the time.

Another driver on the road reported that the car began overtaking vehicles from behind before swerving back in as vehicles were coming in the other direction.

Anyone who witnessed this taking place or was driving on the road at the time and has dashcam footage is asked to call 101 quoting incident 465 of 31 July.
