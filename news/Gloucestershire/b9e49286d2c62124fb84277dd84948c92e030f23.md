Officers in Gloucester are appealing for witnesses to an assault which took place in Barnwood last month.

It was reported that a woman was assaulted on Chase Lane at approximately 4.15am on Monday 4 November.

It is understood that the victim was on Chase Lane Industrial Estate when she was attacked by a man who got out of a 2011-2015 model white Vauxhall Astra GTC.

CCTV enquiries show that a 2003-2010 model silver Vauxhall Meriva and other vehicles were also in the area at the time and any occupants may have witnessed this taking place.

Anyone who was in the area at the time or knows the occupants of the cars is asked to call 101 quoting incident 247 of 4 November.

A 29-year-old man from Gloucester was arrested on suspicion of assault in connection with the incident and has since been released under investigation.
