A number of puppies that were recovered during the arrest of a man on Saturday are healthy and now being cared for in a secured kennel.

Between 30 and 40 puppies; consisting of Border Collies, Beagles and Jack Russell's were recovered from a van as part of the arrest of a man on suspicion of the theft of puppies over the weekend.

The puppies have been assessed and two remain in the care of a veterinary surgery.

Police were called to the Charlton Kings area of Cheltenham on Saturday (22 August) following reports that a man was seen to have been loading a number of puppies into a van.

Enquiries were conducted into the vehicle which was stopped on the M6 before a 24-year-old man from Durham was arrested in connection with the incident.

He has since been released under investigation pending further enquiries.
