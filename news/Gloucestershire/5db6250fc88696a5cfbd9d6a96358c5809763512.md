Officers are trying to locate a man who was involved in a collision with a car in Gloucester this afternoon (Wednesday).

Police were called to Mead Road in Abbeymead shortly after 5.15pm following reports that a pedestrian had ran away after being involved in a collision with a car.

The pedestrian was described as being a white man in his mid-20s who is believed to be 5ft 8ins tall.

He had an eastern European accent and was wearing a dark hoody with the hood up, dark jogging bottoms and trainers.

The collision took place near Turmut-Hoer pub and officers have been unable to locate the man despite conducting searches in the local area.

Officers are concerned for the man's welfare and would like to check that he is ok.

Anyone with information, who has seen the man or knows who he may be is asked to call 101 quoting incident 320 of 18 December.
