Officers in Cheltenham are appealing for information after a spate of burglaries in the Prestbury area overnight.

Five burglaries are reported to have taken place between last night (Thursday) and this morning (Friday) with offenders gaining entry before searching the properties and leaving with items from inside.

The first burglary was reported as taking place on Whitehorn Drive shortly after 2am when a homeowner woke up to find that unknown offenders had gained entry before conducting an untidy search and stealing a handbag and mobile phone.

The burglary is believed to have taken place between 11.30pm and 1.55am and officers who attended located the stolen items nearby.

Two of the burglaries took place on South View Way and were reported at 6am and 7am this morning.

In the first burglary it was reported that offenders gained entry to a conservatory overnight before searching the area however nothing is believed to have been stolen.

The second burglary on South View Way saw offenders gain entry between 11pm and 6.40am before searching the property and stealing the spare keys to two cars as well as a mobile phone.

A further burglary was reported on Maida Vale Road where offenders gained entry before stealing a number of items from inside, these include a North Face coat, multiple sets of keys and other items that have since been found nearby.

The last burglary took place on Finchcroft Lane between midnight and 6.45am when offenders gained entry via a window, it was reported that car keys and a purse were taken however these have since been found by members of the public.

It's believed the offender took a Tropicana orange juice carton (similar to the one pictured below) from one of the properties, and investigating officers would like to ask anyone who finds one discarded in the local area to not touch it but contact police in case there are any DNA opportunities to catch the thirsty offender.

Anyone who witnessed suspicious activity in the area or has information is asked to call 101 quoting the below incident numbers:

 * Whitehorn Drive: incident 13 of 20 March
 * South View Way: incidents 29 and 33 of 20 March
 * Maida Vale Road: incident 41 of 20 March
 * Finchcroft Lane: incident 44 of 20 March.

Alternatively, information can also be submitted by using the 'update a crime report' form on the Constabulary's website: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/

Most reported burglaries are found to be opportunistic and we would like to remind residents to check that their properties are secure and to report any suspicious activity or noises by calling 101 or 999 if an incident is in progress.
