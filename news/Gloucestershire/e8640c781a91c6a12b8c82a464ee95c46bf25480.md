The Cheltenham Neighbourhood Policing Team is running an operation in the Town Centre and at local retail parks as Christmas approaches.

From tomorrow (Thursday 10 December) through to Wednesday 23 December, officers will be conducting high visibility patrols as part of Operation Kracker to ensure that there is not a rise in incidents of anti-social behaviour or thefts as the area gets busier.

The operation will see officers target popular shopping areas such as the High Street and Brewery Quarter as this is where most of the shops are situated.

In previous years there have been issues related to anti-social behaviour such as street drinking/begging and the operation aims to tackle this too.

The Neighbourhood/Community Engagement Vehicles and CCTV vans will be utilised by officers to ensure that there is a proactive police presence and to help deter any offenders.

Officers will also be available to support businesses and the Cheltenham Day Safe Scheme should any issues arise within their premises as part of a multi-agency approach.

Acting Inspector Steve Benbow said: "It is anticipated that Cheltenham Town Centre will be a lot busier in the lead up to Christmas and we want to ensure that everyone stays safe and any issues are kept to a minimum.

"The team are aiming to provide reassurance to the public during what some may see as a stressful and busy time, reduce any opportunistic offending and encourage personal safety whilst out and about.

"Anyone who has concerns about anything they see whilst Christmas shopping can speak to a member of the team who is on patrol or at one of our engagement vehicles as we will be more than happy to help."
