Officers investigating an incident in Cheltenham where a teenager was reported to have been seen with a samurai sword are appealing for a number of people to come forward.

Following CCTV inquiries investigating officers are keen to hear from people who had been in the High Street by John Lewis and were approached by a teenage boy on a gold coloured bike between 12.30am and 1.30am on Monday 31 August.

Due to it being a Bank Holiday there had been a number of people in town that evening.

At around 1.20am on Monday police responded to a report that a teenager had been seen cycling on London Road with a samurai sword on his back.

Officers attended and a 14-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon. A short samurai sword was located in an alley and seized.

Gloucestershire Constabulary issued a public appeal for information on Monday following the incident and a knifepoint robbery of a takeaway delivery driver in Hester's Way at around 10.30pm on Sunday 30 August.

The 14-year-old boy was arrested in connection with both incidents and a 15-year-old boy was later arrested on suspicion of robbery of the takeaway delivery driver. Both boys, who are from Cheltenham, were released on police bail.

Anyone who was approached in the High Street or has any information which could help police with their investigation is asked to submit this online by completing the update a crime report form on the Constabulary's website, quoting incident 41 of 31 August: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/
