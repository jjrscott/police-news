Officers are appealing for information after a man attempted to defraud an elderly victim in Gloucester at the end of last month.

Police were called to Tuffley Avenue on the afternoon of Wednesday 27 January after a man was caught on ring doorbell footage approaching a vulnerable man's address and attempting to convince him that his wife had asked for their path to be jet washed.

The offender went on to discuss how the victim was going to pay him and offered to take his debit card to a cash machine in order to get money for him to pay if he did not have cash in the house.

The victim's daughter saw what was happening after watching on the ring doorbell app and a neighbour attended to speak to the offender who left shortly afterwards.

This took place at around 1pm on the day and officers want to ensure that no-one else was also targeted by the man.

The man was described as being of a medium build, had an Irish accent and thinning hair. He was wearing a blue quarter zip top, white polo shirt and blue jeans.

Investigating officers are asking anyone with information or who may also have been visited by the man to contact police quoting incident 317 of 27 January.
