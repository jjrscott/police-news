A man from Gloucester has been sentenced following an investigation by the Gloucester Neighbourhood Policing and Force Crime Operations teams into drugs offences.

Marc Shum, aged 30 and of Sandpiper Close in Quedgeley appeared at Gloucester Crown Court last Wednesday (11 March) where he was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison.

This follows his guilty pleas to possession with intent to supply class A drugs (cocaine), possession with intent to supply class B drugs (cannabis) and possession of criminal property.

As well as this Shum is also the subject of a Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) hearing which is due to be heard on Tuesday 21 July.

Officers became aware of Shum's offending when he was spotted acting suspiciously in the area of Brockworth Bypass in Hucclecote on Monday 13 January.

Acting Sergeant Allun Johnson from the Gloucester Neighbourhood Policing Team said: "Our joint working with the Force Crime Operations team allowed for the successful conviction of Shum.

"I hope that our investigation and the conviction shows our dedication to tackling drug dealing and keeping the public safe from harm.

"Any members of the public who have concerns about drug dealing in their local communities are asked to report this to us that the matter can be looked into further, this can be done by calling 101 or using our online reporting form: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/soh/something-youve-seen-or-heard/."
