Three men were arrested by Force Crime Operations officers this morning (Thursday 16 July) after a large quantity of cannabis was discovered in Cheltenham.

A drugs warrant was executed at an address in the Rowanfield area and 114 cannabis plants were found inside.

Two men from Cheltenham, aged 35 and 37, plus a 37-year-old man from Tewkesbury were arrested on suspicion of the manufacture and production of class B drugs and remain in police custody at this time.

In the last year, the Force Crime Operations Team have recovered more than one million pounds worth of cannabis plants.
