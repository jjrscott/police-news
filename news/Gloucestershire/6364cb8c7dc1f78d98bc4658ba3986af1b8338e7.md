Four people were arrested in Cheltenham during the early hours of this morning thanks to a member of the public who reported suspicious activity.

Police were called to Buttercross Lane in Prestbury shortly after 2.20am after a resident had seen a number of people acting suspiciously in what they thought was a burglary taking place.

Officers attended and identified four people trying to force entry to a property who ran away before they could be spoken to.

A foot chase ensued and the group were quickly located before being detained. A suspected stolen vehicle was also found nearby and is due to be returned to the owner in due course.

A 19-year-old woman and 17 year-old boy were both arrested on suspicion of burglary. A 22-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of burglary and theft of a motor vehicle and a 21-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of burglary, going equipped and theft of a motor vehicle.

All four remain in custody at this time pending further enquiries.

Officers are currently taking part in an anti-burglary campaign now that the darker nights are here.

Police encourage the public to look at installing a 'WIDE' combination of security devices as they can provide 49 times more protection against residential burglary with entry compared to having no devices installed.
