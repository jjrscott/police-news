A man has been charged in connection with the wounding of another man in Gloucester on Sunday afternoon (2 August).

Kevin McNeil, 19 and of Great Western Road was arrested on Tuesday (4 August) before being charged with attempted murder and possession of a bladed weapon during the early hours of morning (Thursday).

Three other men were also arrested on suspicion of attempted murder following information that had been submitted to police and have since been released on conditional police bail until Wednesday 2 September.

The bail conditions mean that the men have a curfew to stay at their home addresses between 10pm and 7am every day.

Investigating officers are continuing to look into whether a car fire in Abbeymead is linked to the stabbing and would like to yet again appeal for information that the community may hold and deem to be relevant to the investigation.

As part of the investigation, around 20 knives and machetes have been seized and neighbourhood policing officers have been conducting reassurance patrols in the local area.

The victim remains in hospital at this time where he is receiving treatment for leg injuries.

Anyone with information about the incident who hasn't yet spoken to police is asked to call 101 quoting incident 350 of 2 August.

Information can also be submitted anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or by visiting https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/forms/give-information-anonymously
