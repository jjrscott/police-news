A man has been sentenced to three months in prison and is now the subject of a criminal behaviour order after pleading guilty to his involvement in a bicycle theft.

Craig Mulcahy, 33 and of no fixed abode appeared at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court on Tuesday where he was sentenced after pleading guilty to the theft of a bicycle and resisting a police officer in the execution of their duty.

Mulcahy and another man were detained by officers last week following reports that a bicycle had been stolen from Gloucester Quays. Mulcahy struggled with the officer before running away.

He was arrested three days later where he admitted the offences and was remanded in custody.

As well as the prison sentence, Mulcahy received a criminal behaviour order, which is in effect for three years and bans him from being in Gloucester City Centre, the grounds of Gloucestershire Royal Hospital and from associating with a named individual.

PC Plant from Gloucester Neighbourhood Policing Team said: "Cycle theft is a serious issue for us and we want people to be able to come into town and leave their bike without the fear of it being stolen.

"We have pursued Mulcahy and restricted his criminal activity and my team are determined to target all cycle thieves in the same manner to make Gloucester City Centre a safer place."
