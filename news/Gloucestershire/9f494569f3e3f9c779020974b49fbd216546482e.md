Investigating officers have been conducting a number of enquiries since the weekend and are now asking three people who are believed to have spoken to the boy after the incident to come forward.

It is understood that the boy spoke to the people near to the Weaver's Shop Carpet Warehouse on Eastern Avenue at around 10pm on the night. They were described as being two white women and a black man who was wearing Nike Vapormax trainers
