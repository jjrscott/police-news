Two people were arrested as part of Operation Kracker yesterday afternoon after officers conducted a vehicle stop and found suspected stolen clothing inside.

A 33-year-old man and 20-year-old woman, both from Gloucester, were arrested on suspicion of theft from a shop and the vehicle was seized.

CCTV enquiries are ongoing to identify the shops that the clothing was stolen from and the pair have been released under investigation whilst this takes place.
