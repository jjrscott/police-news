Officers are appealing for witnesses to an aggravated burglary which took place in Tewkesbury yesterday (Sunday 29 December).

Police were called to a property on Newtown Lane shortly after 7pm last night following reports of an aggravated burglary.

It was reported that four men who were in possession of bolt croppers and a crowbar had forced entry to a property before attacking the victim and conducting a search of the property.

Fortunately the victim did not sustain any injuries and nothing is believed to have been stolen during the incident.

The offenders are described as being four men who were wearing dark clothing and had their faces and heads covered.

Enquiries conducted in the local area show that they left in a red pick up truck which was parked on the corner of Springfield Road and Ashchurch Road.

Officers would like to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and may have dashcam or CCTV footage of this taking place.

Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call police on 101 quoting incident 292 of 29 December.

Information can also be submitted anonymously by calling the independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
