A woman aged in her 70s had her purse stolen from her handbag while in Kings Square, Gloucester last week.

She was near to Iceland at around 1.35pm on Thursday (9 January) when she was forcibly bumped from behind, which nearly made her fall over. It's thought her purse, which contained cash and cards, was stolen during this.

When the woman turned around she saw a man quickly walking away. She described him as a black man who was tall in height and aged in his late 30s to early 40s. He had black hair, large sideburns and was wearing dark clothing.

Anyone who witnessed this incident or has any information which could help with police enquiries is asked to call 101 and reference crime 1059/20.

The woman was physically unharmed but understandably upset by what happened.

Please be wary of who is around you when using your card and pin number, keep your bag closed and with you at all times, rather than attaching it to a shopping trolley as thieves are opportunistic.
