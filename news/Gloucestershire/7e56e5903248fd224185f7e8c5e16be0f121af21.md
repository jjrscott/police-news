Investigating officers are appealing for the public's help to identify a man who they want to speak to in connection with a theft.

Earlier this year on 12 March at a shop in Dubridge, Stroud a man was stopped at the entrance by staff after attempting to leave without paying between 10.40am and 11am.

The man is described as being of a medium build, has scruffy black hair and was wearing a baseball cap and blue puffa jacket.

It is believed the man is linked to a blue transit van that was parked in the car park.

If you believe you know the man pictured, or have any information about the van, please contact police on 101 quoting incident 181 of 12 March.#
