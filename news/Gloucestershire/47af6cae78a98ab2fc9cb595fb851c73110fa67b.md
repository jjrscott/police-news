Officers are appealing for witnesses to an altercation which took place in Tredworth earlier today (Thursday).

Shortly before 2pm, we received a report of an altercation involving two men who were said to be in possession of an iron bar and knife.

Armed officers were deployed to Bathurst Road in Gloucester and conducted searches of the area.

Two men, aged 42 and 53, were subsequently located on High Street and arrested on suspicion of affray in connection with the incident.

It is believed that a number of people may have seen what happened and officers would like to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time or witnessed this taking place.

Officers would also like to hear from anyone who may have been approached or threatened by either of the men during the incident.

If you have any information please call 101 quoting incident 206 of 19 December.
