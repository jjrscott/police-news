Officers are still appealing for information to identify a motorist after a collision in Cheltenham two weeks ago.

A BMX and a vehicle described as a white car/van with an orange light on the top and a contractor logo on the side were in collision close to the central reservation on the A40 westbound carriageway at the Arle Court roundabout at around 5pm on Wednesday 17 March.

The cyclist, a 16-year-old boy who has been identified following an earlier social media appeal, was shaken and had a grazed arm and bruised leg but did not suffer serious injuries.

Officers still want the driver to come forward so they can speak to them.

Anyone with information should fill in the following online form, quoting incident 484 of 17 March https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/contact/af/contact-us/us/a-crime-that-has-already-been-reported/.
