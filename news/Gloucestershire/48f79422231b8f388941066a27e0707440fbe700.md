Police are appealing for the owner of a dog to contact police after it bit a child in Randwick woods, Stroud at the end of last month.

Between 3.40pm and 3.50pm on Sunday 24 January a family were walking through Randwick woods, when a scruffy, mixed breed, medium sized dog ran up to an eight-year-old.

The dog bit the child around the waist and shook them before letting go and returning to its owner, a woman believed to be in her 50s.

The dog's owner was described as being white, of a slim build with blonde hair, wearing jeans, walking boots with socks ruffled over the top, hessian type blazer or coat in green and brown and a scarf.

She apologised and left the area.

The eight-year-old victim suffered bruising.

Officers would like to speak to any witnesses of this incident or anyone who believes they may have had a similar encounter with this dog.

Police are also asking the owner of the dog to also contact police quoting incident 433 of 24 January.

Information can be submitted online using this form: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/

Or by telephoning 101 and quoting the incident number.
