We're reminding the public to please be vigilant following a number of catalytic converter thefts in the county.

In recent weeks there has been a number of reports of catalytic converter thefts taking place with a majority of these being in Cheltenham and Gloucester.

Reported incidents have included catalytic converters being stolen from vehicles parked in public car parks and it is believed that offenders will pull up alongside a vehicle before cutting off the catalytic converter with a saw or angle grinder.

There are a number of signs that you can look out for such as your vehicle making a loud rumbling sound as soon as the engine is turned on and this will normally get louder as you put your foot on the accelerator.

Residents are asked to report any catalytic converter thefts or suspicious activity around vehicles by calling 101 or 999 if a crime is in progress.

Information can also be submitted via our online form: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/soh/something-youve-seen-or-heard/
