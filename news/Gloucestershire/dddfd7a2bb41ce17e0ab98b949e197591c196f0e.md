Officers are keen to speak to two males who were seen being chased by a group of four people in Gloucester last month.

Police were called to Alvin Street in the city at 12.55am on Tuesday 22 September after a member of the public reported seeing two males who had been chased and possibly attacked by the group who ran off in the direction of London Road.

The victims left the area before they could be spoken to and investigating officers are asking for them to come forward.

The two victims remain unidentified and anyone with information is asked to submit this by calling 101 and quoting incident 38 of 22 September.

Information can also be submitted by completing the following online form and referencing the incident number: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/
