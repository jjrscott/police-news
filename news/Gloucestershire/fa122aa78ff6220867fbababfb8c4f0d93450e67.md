Officers in Cheltenham are appealing for information following an indecent exposure in the town centre at the end of last month.

Police were called to Poundland on High Street at around 12.45pm on Monday 30 December following reports that a man had exposed himself whilst inside the shop.

An 81-year-old man was arrested in connection with the incident and has since been bailed but officers are still keen to hear from anyone who was in the area or witnessed this incident taking place.

Anyone with information should call 101 and quote incident 168 of 30 December. Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be called anonymously on 0800 555 111.
