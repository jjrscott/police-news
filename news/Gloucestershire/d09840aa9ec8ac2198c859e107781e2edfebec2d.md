Officers from our Force Crime Operations team have shared a Facebook photo gallery of seized items in a bid to find the rightful owners.

It is believed that the items may have been stolen and investigating officers are asking members of the public to please take a look at the album and let us know if you recognise any of the items or know who they may belong to.

The seized items include a gold Rolex watch, silver Brietling watch, numerous rings and items of furniture such as antique style mirrors.

Anyone who recognises something is asked to submit information via our online form referencing incident 81 of 1 April and include a description of the item/items: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/

Information can also be submitted by calling 101 and quoting incident 81 of 1 April.

Please note that due to the number of images we cannot upload them so have created a photo album on our Facebook page and this can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/pg/gloucestershire.constabulary/photos/?tab=album&album_id=10157196144550496
