Shortly after 10.30pm on Sunday (30 August) police received a report that a takeaway delivery driver had their food order stolen whilst being threatened with a large knife at the rear of Coronation Square, Edinburgh Place in Hester's Way.

No-one was injured in the incident and despite prompt police attendance no suspects were located.

Following this, around 1.20am on Monday 31 August, police responded to a report that a teenager had been seen cycling on London Road with a samurai sword on his back.

Officers attended and a 14-year-old boy from Cheltenham was arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon.

A short samurai sword was located in an alley and was seized.

The teenager was further arrested on suspicion of robbery in connection with the earlier described incident on Sunday night.
