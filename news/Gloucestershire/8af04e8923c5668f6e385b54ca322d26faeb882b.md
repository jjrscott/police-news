Two people remain in custody today, Friday 15 May, in connection with the discovery of human remains in the Forest of Dean earlier this week.

A post-mortem examination yesterday was found to be inconclusive and further examinations are ongoing to establish the cause of death.

DNA testing is also ongoing to identify the female victim.

Searches have continued today around the area of Stowfield Quarry, near Coleford and some road closures remain in place in the surrounding area.

Police would like to thank local residents and those impacted by the closures for their patience throughout the investigation.

Searches have taken place at premises in both Birmingham and Wolverhampton following the arrests of a woman aged in her 20s and a man aged in his 30s.
