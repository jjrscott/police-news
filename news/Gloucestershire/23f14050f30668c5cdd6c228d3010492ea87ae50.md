Officers are appealing for witnesses to a fatal single vehicle collision which took place near Kemble last night (Thursday 2 April).

A member of the public found a white Audi S3 which had overturned on the A429 just outside the village in the direction of Cirencester shortly after 8.25pm.

A 53-year-old man from Kemble was treated at the scene by paramedics but sadly died at the scene.

The man's next of kin has been informed.

The road was closed for several hours whist a serious road traffic collision investigation was carried out.

Anyone who witnessed the collision is urged to call 101 and quote incident 392 of 2 April.
