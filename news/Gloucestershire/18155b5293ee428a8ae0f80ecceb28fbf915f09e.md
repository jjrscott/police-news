Officers are appealing for witnesses and information following an incident resulting in a pregnant sheep dying in the Stroud area.

At around 4.30pm on Friday 19 February three young boys were seen chasing sheep in a field in the Lypiatt area.

The ewes were all pregnant and last year's lambs were also in the field when it happened.

One of the ewes was seen to fall to the ground while being chased.

The three boys are all described as being dressed in dark clothing, with two aged around seven or eight years old and one older and taller.

The ewe that collapsed sadly died on Monday (22 February) night.

One of last year's lambs was also found the other side of the electric wire caught in some brambles.

It is currently unknown if any of the unborn lambs being carried by the other pregnant ewes have been harmed and the cost of this loss could be very harmful to the farmer's livelihood.

Police understand that these boys may be under the age of criminal responsibility however officers would still like to speak to them regarding this incident.

If anyone has any information or witnessed this incident please contact police using the following form and quoting incident 77 of 20 February:
