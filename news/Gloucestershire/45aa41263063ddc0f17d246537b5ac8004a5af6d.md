A man has died in hospital following a collision on the A40 near Whittington on Friday evening (4 December).

The 19-year-old from Longborough, Moreton-in-Marsh was driving a white Mitsubushi Colt when he collided with a wall at around 11pm.

He was taken to Southmead Hospital in Bristol with life threatening injuries and died yesterday afternoon (Sunday 6 December).

Investigating officers would still like to hear from anyone who saw the collision but hasn't yet spoken to police.

Witnesses are asked to contact police through the following link referencing incident 517 of 4 December: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/contact/af/contact-us/us/a-crime-that-has-already-been-reported/ or by calling 101.

Our thoughts are with the man's family who are now receiving support from specialist officers.
