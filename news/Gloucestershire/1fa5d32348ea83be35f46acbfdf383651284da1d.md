A teenage cyclist suffered head injuries after he was attacked in a suspected road rage incident in Tuffley, Gloucester earlier this week.

The incident started around 8.20pm on Tuesday 16 March when the 17-year-old was cycling through the tunnel on Tuffley Lane.

He was approached by a motorist driving a blue car heading in the opposite direction, and after the motorist drove past him they turned their vehicle around and followed the teenager.

The cyclist fled down Brookthorpe Close where it is believed three men exited the blue car and assaulted him.

Police are now appealing for anyone with dashcam footage who was in these areas at that time to contact them.

Investigating officers are also keen to hear from anyone living in Tuffley Lane or Brookthorpe Close who may have CCTV including doorbell footage.

The victim suffered numerous injuries to his face and head including fractures and was taken to hospital for treatment. He has since been discharged.

House to house enquiries have been taking place and police are keen to hear from anyone else who has any information which could assist the investigation.
