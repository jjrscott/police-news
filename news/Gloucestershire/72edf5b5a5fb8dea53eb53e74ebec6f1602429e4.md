Officers investigating burglars targeting rural and border areas of the county made five arrests last week.

The five males, aged between 16 and 21, were arrested at addresses in Cheltenham and Gloucester on Wednesday (13 May) on suspicion of a number of burglaries in Gloucestershire and other parts of the country.

All five were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary.

They are believed to be linked to the theft of keys for high value cars in other parts of the country as well as aggravated burglaries of a Morrison's in Cheltenham and a takeaway in Cirencester, both in September 2019.

All five have been bailed with conditions not to associate with each other while the investigation progresses. They will return to police in June.

The arrests were made as part of an operation that started in September last year following a spate of burglaries in areas like the Cotswolds. Top end cars like Golf R's and a number of Audi and Mercedes models were stolen and then used to help commit break-ins at shops and homes.

An operation was set up to tackle the rising problem, which is part of a wider regional and national trend.
