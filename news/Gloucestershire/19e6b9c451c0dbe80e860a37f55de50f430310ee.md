Officers investigating an assault where a man suffered a fractured eye socket have released an E-fit image of a man they would like to identify.

It's believed the man is aged in his early 20s and he had been with a group of people at the time.

The incident happened on Sunday 17 November at around 2.05am on Cambray Place, Cheltenham and the victim also suffered a broken nose.

We appealed for witnesses and information not long after the assault, and are now appealing for the public's help in identifying the suspect.

Anyone who recognises the man pictured below is asked to call police on 101 and reference incident 298 of 17 November or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
