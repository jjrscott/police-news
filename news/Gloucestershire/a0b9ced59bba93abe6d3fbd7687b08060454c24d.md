We've had a number of reports of lewd acts being committed in Cheltenham over the past week and we're appealing for information.

One incident happened last Thursday (23 January) at approximately 4.20pm where a schoolgirl saw a man committing a lewd act while sat parked in a dark coloured car on Whaddon Avenue.

The following day there was a report of a white man aged 30s to 40s sat on a bench masturbating in Sandford Park at around 5.15pm. The caller described him as being of a slim build, with fair balding hair and was wearing a long sleeved top. His trousers were around his ankles. We attended however the man was not located.

On Monday this week (27 January) a man exposed himself to a woman in St Peters Park, Chelt Walk opposite the Big Yellow Storage. He was described as being a white man, around 25-years-old, slim to medium build, 5ft 7ins tall and was wearing dark clothing with a red or brown bobble hat.

Yesterday (Tuesday 28 January) a white man was seen exposing himself with his trousers around his ankles while in a bush on the Honeybourne Line. He was wearing a grey puffer jacket, white long sleeved top and had short brown hair.

The Cheltenham neighbourhood policing team have been carrying out patrols and we're investigating the reports. It is not yet known whether they were committed by the same man.
