Officers from the Cheltenham Neighbourhood Policing Team are appealing for witnesses after a man indecently exposed himself in a park at the weekend

Police were called to Springfields Park at 9.30pm on Saturday (1 August) following reports that a man had exposed himself before committing a lewd act.

The man was described as being black, aged in his twenties and was wearing a burgundy jumper with black jeans and black Nike trainers with white soles.

He had a large diamond earring in his left ear and it is thought that he may have been drunk.

The park is located between Springbank Resource Centre and Hester's Way Road and it is believed that a number of people may have witnessed this taking place.

Anyone who has information and hasn't yet spoken to police is asked to call 101 quoting incident 509 of 1 August.
