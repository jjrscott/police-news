Police have released images of a man they want to speak to in connection with an incident where a shop worker was spat at last month.

It was reported that a man who said he did not have an exemption to not wear a face covering was offered one by staff, but he refused it.

He was then denied entry to the store on 19 January and it has been alleged that the man spat at staff while leaving the store in Gloucester.

Investigating officers would now like to speak to the man pictured in the CCTV images below in connection with the incident.

If you recognise the male pictured you can submit information to police online by completing the update a crime report form, quoting incident 322 of 19 January: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/
