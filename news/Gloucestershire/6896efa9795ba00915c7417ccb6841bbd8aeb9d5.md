Officers are appealing for witnesses after a car was damaged near Cleeve Hill on Monday evening (17 August).

Police were called to a track road near Upper Hill Farm at 6.35pm following reports that a black Volkswagen Golf which was parked in the area had been damaged with all of the windows being smashed.

This is believed to have taken place at around 5.45pm and a number of golf clubs were found inside the car which officers believe were used to cause the damage.

A 2008 plate silver Ford Focus, with four men inside, was seen to be leaving the area shortly afterwards and officers are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed this or has information.

Anyone with information about the incident who has not yet spoken to police is asked to call 101 quoting incident 409 of 17 August.
