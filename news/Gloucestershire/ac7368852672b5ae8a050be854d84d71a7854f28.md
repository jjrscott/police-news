Can you help? We're trying to identify and locate a woman after she was found in distress in Cheltenham just over an hour ago.

At around 1.40pm today (Friday), a member of the public called us to say they had come across a woman with facial injuries who was walking along Evesham Road.

The member of the public tried to speak to the woman and help, but she left while the caller was speaking to our control room.

We're concerned for her welfare and asking for anyone who has seen her to contact police on 101 and quote incident 219 of today. She was last seen heading towards Bishops Cleeve.

She's described as being a white woman, with brown hair, aged in her late 20s, 5ft 5ins tall and of a thin build. She also had a brown Staffordshire Bull Terrier.
