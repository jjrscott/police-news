One man is in custody and two stolen vehicles recovered after they were brought to a stop in Stow-on-the-Wold in the early hours of this morning, Friday 24 July.

Police spotted a suspected stolen 4x4 towing a caravan at around 3.20am and followed them while other police resources were deployed to assist.

Road closures were put in place as a stinger device was used to puncture the tyres of the vehicles in order to safely bring them to a stop.

A man then fled but was pursued by officers and a police dog and was subsequently located in a field minutes later and arrested.

The 4x4 and caravan have been recovered and a 40-year-old man from Evesham, Worcestershire remains in custody on suspicion of theft.

The caravan was found to have been stolen from a farm yard in Bampton, West Oxfordshire.
