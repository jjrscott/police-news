Police have released CCTV images of four people they want to talk to in connection with criminal damage and theft at a Cotswolds church.

The images were captured at St James Church, Chipping Campden at about 4.15pm on Tuesday 18 February where a wooden charity box was damaged as it was torn from the wall. The box is believed to have contained between £30 and £50 in cash, which was then stolen.

There was no forced entry to the Church Street building.

PC Sarah Crawford, who is investigating the incident, would like to hear from anyone who was in the area at the relevant time or recognises any of the boys.

She said: "I realise that the facial details are not very clear but I am hoping that someone may recognise these four boys from their body shapes or clothing.

"Anyone with information should call us on 101 quoting incident 100 of 19 February."
