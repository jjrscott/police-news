Police are appealing for the public's help to identify a man they want to speak to in connection with an assault in a Gloucester supermarket last month.

On 9 January at around 5pm a man was challenged by staff in the store about not wearing a face covering.

It's alleged that the man then became verbally abusive and was further challenged by a shopper.

Following that challenge the man then physically assaulted the shopper before leaving the store.

Police would now like to speak to the man pictured below in connection with the incident.

If you believe you know the identity of this man or have any information regarding this incident please submit this online by completing the following form, and quoting incident 336 of 9 January: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/

You can also call police on 101, quoting the same number.
