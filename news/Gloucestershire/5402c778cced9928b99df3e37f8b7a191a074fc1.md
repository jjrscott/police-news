Gloucestershire Constabulary will be escorting an abnormal load through the county on Friday morning (21 August), which may cause delays to drivers travelling in the area.

Two Buccaneer Aircrafts will be receiving a police escort from junction eight of the M5 to Kemble Airfield during the morning and drivers using the route are advised to allow extra time for their journeys.

The abnormal load will join junction 8 of the M5 at 9am before leaving at junction 11A and continuing along the A417 and A429 before arriving at Kemble.

Due to the size of the planes there will be a need for temporary road closures to help with manoeuvres and police would like to thank drivers in advance for their co-operation.
