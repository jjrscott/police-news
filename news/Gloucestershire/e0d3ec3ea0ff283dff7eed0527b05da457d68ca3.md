It has now been just over two years since the body of a man was discovered near the Bathurst Estate in Cirencester.

A forestry worker discovered the remains of a man close to the A419 Stroud Road on the afternoon of Tuesday 1 May 2018.

An appeal was launched for information on the man's identity last April (2019) as he remained unidentified despite all of the necessary forensic and DNA examinations being completed.

Officers are now able to provide an update on the information that was submitted by members of the public as a result of their appeal and accompanying video.

73 names were suggested by members of the public (this included varying levels of information from names to limited descriptions only) and to date 51 of these have been eliminated from the enquiry.

Enquiries are currently being made into 22 of the suggested names with further DNA analysis being considered.

Detective Inspector Alistair Hammett said: "I would like to thank everyone who submitted information following our appeal last year as this has allowed us to undertake significant follow-up enquiries.

"At this stage I am not appealing for further information on the man's identity as a number of lines of enquiry remain such as speaking to those who are known to the individuals and cross referencing against missing people and DNA databases."
