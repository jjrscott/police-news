Police are investigating a car key burglary in Cheltenham on Saturday night (29 February) and appealing for information to help identify the offenders.

Between 8.20 and 8.50pm thieves forced their way into the rear of a property in Leyson road in The Reddings and stole keys to a blue Ford Fiesta which they then stole from the driveway.

They also stole a gold banded engagement ring with one blue and two white stones, a 55" television, and a small black purse containing about Â£80 cash and a gift card.

Earlier in the evening police received a report of a burglary in Harrington Drive, Cheltenham where four males had been seen leaving the property in a car. They were wearing dark clothing and had their faces covered. One was carrying a long implement.

It was then discovered that the rear patio doors of the property had been smashed but it is believed that nothing was stolen.

Anyone who saw any suspicious activity in either of the locations on Saturday night, or has any information which would help officers, is asked to call Gloucestershire Constabulary on 101 quoting incidents 456 or 421 of 29 February.
