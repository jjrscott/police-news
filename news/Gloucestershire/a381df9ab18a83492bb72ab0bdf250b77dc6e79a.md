Police are warning people to be vigilant after a National Insurance scam was reported yesterday (Tuesday).

A resident living in Gloucester received a call from an automated number which stated to be HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and said that his details were being used fraudulently.

The man was advised to press 1 to speak to an advisor to provide his National Insurance number and prevent his assets from being frozen which he found to be suspicious so hung up.

Telephone numbers can easily be spoofed so anyone who gets an alleged call from HMRC is advised not to give any information but to tell the caller to write to them as they will have all their personal details.

The Telephone Preference Service (TPS) is free and can help reduce the number of nuisance and scam calls you receive. To register, please visit: https://www.tpsonline.org.uk/register

More advice to help stop you from becoming a victim of fraud is below:

• If you believe you are being targeted by a scammer hang up the phone and use a different phone line to call Action Fraud or the police, as scammers have a way to stay on the line and will pretend to be the police when you call back.

• If you don't have access to a different phone line, wait for a period of time and try calling a family member or friend first to make sure the scammer is no longer on the line.

• Just because someone knows basic details about you like your address or date of birth, it doesn't mean they are genuine police employees.

• Always question suspicious phone calls and report them to Action Fraud or the police.

• Always have a pad and pen next to the phone, if you get a suspicious call, take details, don't get flustered, get names addresses and contact numbers then disconnect the call.
