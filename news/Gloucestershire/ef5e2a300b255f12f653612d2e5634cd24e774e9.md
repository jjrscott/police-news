Officers are asking residents to please be vigilant following a recent rise in vehicle and shed/garage breaks in the Tewkesbury area.

Rural areas such as Bishops Cleeve, Winchcombe and Witcombe are amongst the areas that have been targeted by offenders.

10 thefts from vehicles have been reported so far this month and investigating officers believe that offenders have gained entry before conducting searches and stealing items from inside.

Criminals are quick to exploit any opportunity they are presented with, such as taking advantage of unlocked vehicles, and officers are urging owners to remove valuable items when leaving vehicles overnight as well as parking in well-lit areas where possible.

As well as this four shed/garage breaks have also been reported with items such as gardening equipment and bicycles being stolen.

With the summer months here homeowners are advised to ensure that their sheds and garages are kept secure and that valuable items are not on display.
