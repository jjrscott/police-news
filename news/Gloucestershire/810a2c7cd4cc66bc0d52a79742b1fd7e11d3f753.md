An off-duty officer and members of the public detained a male armed with a hammer following a robbery at a Tesco Express in Abbeymead.

Shortly after 8pm yesterday (Sunday 5 January) police were called with a report of an armed robbery at the supermarket on Mead Road where money had been taken from the till.

As the suspect tried to flee on a bike he was apprehended by off-duty Inspector Ross Fidoe, a Force Incident Manager in our control room, and assisted by numerous members of the public before officers arrived.

Gloucestershire Constabulary would like to thank all those who assisted.

No-one suffered physical injuries in the incident.

A 17-year-old from Gloucester was arrested on suspicion of robbery and remains in custody to be questioned.
