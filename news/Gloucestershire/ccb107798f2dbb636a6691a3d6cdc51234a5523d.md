Officers in Tewkesbury are appealing for information as the public toilets at the Spring Gardens car park on Oldbury Road have been vandalised.

It was reported that the public toilets have been vandalised on a number of occasions over the past couple of weeks.

The first incident is believed to have taken place between 12pm on 11 July and 6am on 12 July and the second incident was reported to have taken place at some point between 6pm on 13 July and 6am on 14 July.

On both occasions offenders forced entry before damaging sinks, blocking toilets and removing soap dispenser and toilet roll holders.

In the most recent incident, offenders forced entry by damaging the doors beyond repair.

This is believed to have taken place at some point between 6pm on Friday (17 July) and 7am on Saturday (18 July) and anyone with information or who witnessed this taking place is asked to call 101 with incident 108 of 20 July.
