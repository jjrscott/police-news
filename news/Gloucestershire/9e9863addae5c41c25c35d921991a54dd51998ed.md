A man has been sentenced to four years and nine months in prison after pleading guilty to a burglary which took place at a property in Gloucester earlier this year.

Matthew Portlock, 41 and of Matson Lane pleaded guilty to one count of burglary and one count of possession of cannabis after appearing at Gloucester Crown Court today, Friday 13 December.

He was also ordered to pay a Â£180 victim surcharge fee.

Police were called to St Mary's Square shortly after 11.45pm on Saturday 29 June following reports that the homeowner had disturbed a burglar who had made off with two bags containing personal belongings.

Officers attended and Portlock was located on Eastgate Street before being arrested.

Detective Sergeant Austin Parry said: "The quick reporting of the incident allowed officers who were on patrol in the area to locate Portlock nearby.

"The result of Portlock's activities greatly impacted on the victim and made her feel unsafe in her own home.

"Portlock was on release from prison on licence at the time of the burglary and I am pleased that we were able to get this outcome for the victim.
