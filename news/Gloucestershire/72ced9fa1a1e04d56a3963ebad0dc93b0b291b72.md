Officers in the Forest of Dean are appealing for witnesses after a parked car was damaged by unknown offenders.

Police were called to reports that a car had been damaged whilst parked in a lay-by close to Mosley Green near Parkend.

The victim reported that all of the windows of their black BMW 1 series had been smashed and that the BMW badge had been removed from the bonnet.

This is believed to have taken place at some point between 8pm on Sunday (19 July) and 8am on Monday (20 July) whilst the car was parked up.

Officers are asking anyone who witnessed the incident, anything suspicious or who drove past between the above times and has dashcam footage to please call police on 101 quoting incident 284 of 20 July.
