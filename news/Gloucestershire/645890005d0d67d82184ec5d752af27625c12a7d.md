Gloucestershire Constabulary is appealing for help to locate a man who has been reported missing since leaving an address in Stroud.

Concern is growing for the welfare of Mark Smith, 32 who was last seen leaving an address on Turner Road, Dursley on Monday 15 February at around 2.15pm.

Mark is thought to be travelling on foot and has a preference to travel to wooded or rural areas.

Mark is described as being white, 6ft tall, with brown eyes, short brown hair and beard, and of a slim build.

He is likely to be wearing a backpack.

Mark also has a number of tribal style tattoos.

Police are appealing for anyone who has seen him or knows of his whereabouts to call Gloucestershire Constabulary on 101 and quote incident 493 of 25 February.
