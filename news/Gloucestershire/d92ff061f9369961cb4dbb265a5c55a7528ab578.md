Gloucestershire Constabulary is asking people to remain vigilant following an incident in Charlton Kings where people claimed to be police officers.

Three people had knocked on the door of a property at around 7.45pm yesterday, Thursday 19 March, and refused to show identification when asked by the resident.

It has been reported that those at the door said they were there investigating Coronavirus related matters.

This was a scam and thankfully the resident, aged in his 70s, did not let them inside the property due to the unusual circumstances and their lack of willingness to show identification.

When refused entry the trio, two white men and a white woman, left. Their intentions are not known but this appears to be an attempt at a door step scam.

Sergeant Ash Shingler: said: "At a time where many elderly or vulnerable people may be self-isolating due to Coronavirus concerns, please remain vigilant.

"There is a tremendous amount of fantastic work happening locally within our communities, with people offering genuine support, and this is the only report we've had of its kind so far where people have claimed to be police.

"We'll continue to monitor the situation and we don't want people to be alarmed, just please always ask for identification as any member of our Force would be willing to prove they are genuine.

"If you are still unsure, close the door and call us on 101 to check and if they are genuine, they will not mind waiting for you to do this.

"Our Local Neighbourhood Policing teams are continuing to be present within our communities and will be ready to respond when needed. As the Covid-19 pandemic intensifies, please be reassured that policing continues as normal."
