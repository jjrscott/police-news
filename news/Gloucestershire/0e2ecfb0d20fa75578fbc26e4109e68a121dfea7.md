The Cheltenham Neighbourhood Policing Team are appealing for information and witnesses after cars were damaged in the Springbank area over the weekend.

It was reported that cars parked on Blake Croft and nearby Honeybourne Drive were damaged between 2.15am and 2.35am on Saturday with windows and windscreens being targeted.

It is believed that the vehicles may have been targeted by the same offenders due to the proximity of where they were parked.

Officers have contacted local residents and reviewed CCTV and dashcam footage from the time but are also asking for witnesses to come forward.

Anyone who saw suspicious activity in the area or has dashcam/CCTV footage which shows the damage taking place is asked to contact the team here: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/a/your-area/local-policing-team-contact/contact-your-local-policing-team
