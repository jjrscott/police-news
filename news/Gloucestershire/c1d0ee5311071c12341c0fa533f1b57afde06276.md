A man was arrested in Cheltenham last night (Thursday) thanks to a member of the public who called reporting suspicious activity.

Police were called to St Georges Square shortly after 9.25pm after a member of the public had spotted a man attempting to gain entry to a property that is currently under renovation.

Officers attended and located a man inside of the property.

The 35-year-old was subsequently arrested on suspicion of burglary and remains in police custody at this time.

Inspector Emma MacDonald said: "I would like to thank the vigilant member of the public who called our force control room and reported the suspicious activity that they had seen last night.

"Without this information our officers would not have been able to attend as quickly as they did and arrest the man found inside of the property."
