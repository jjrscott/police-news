Officers have released CCTV footage of two men they would like to speak to in connection with a burglary in Minchinhampton near Stroud last week.

Police were called to No 3 the Salon on West End shortly after 10.20am on Sunday (15 December) following reports of a burglary overnight.

It is believed that two people forced entry to the premises before leaving with two bicycles, a reel of copper cabling and loose change from inside.

The stolen bicycles are a red planet X triathlon bike and a white Carrera Virtuoso road bike.

Anyone who recognises the men pictured, has been offered the stolen bikes for sale or has information about the burglary is asked to call 101 quoting incident 147 of 15 December.
