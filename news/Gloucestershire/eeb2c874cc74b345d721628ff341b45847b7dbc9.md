A man has been arrested in connection with a collision in Newent in which a teenage boy was seriously injured and the driver failed to stop.

The 52-year-old man from Newent came forward after seeing media reports about the collision.

He was arrested last Wednesday, 4 March, on suspicion of being the driver of a vehicle which failed to stop after a collision and causing serious injury by dangerous driving.

A vehicle had been recovered for examination and the man has been released under investigation.

The collision happened on the B4215, near the 3 Shires Garden Centre, at about 8.15pm on Saturday 29 February as the teenager was walking along with two friends.

He suffered serious head and leg injuries and remains in Southmead Hospital, Bristol.

No-one else was injured.

Officers investigating the incident are still appealing for information from anyone who witnessed it or has information which might help their enquiries.

PC Kurt Ravenhill said: "We would like to thank members of the public who have already come forward with information and appeal to anyone who has not already spoken to us to get in touch.

"We are in regular contact with the injured boy's family, keeping them updated on the progress of the investigation, and wish him well for a full recovery."

Anyone with information is asked to call Gloucestershire Constabulary on 101 quoting incident 440 of 29 February.
