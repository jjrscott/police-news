Officers investigating a knifepoint robbery in Cheltenham have arrested and released three teenage boys on police bail in connection with the incident.

Police were called to a shop on Devon Avenue shortly after 11.20am yesterday (Tuesday 18 August) following reports that a number of teenagers had forced entry to the shop before threatening an employee with a knife and stealing cash.

The employee was uninjured but shaken during the incident and the knife used was found discarded within the store.

The teenagers left the area on foot and were located nearby after attending officers conducted searches of the area.

A 15-year-old was arrested on suspicion of robbery and the supply of class B drugs, a 13-year-old was arrested on suspicion of burglary, robbery and shoplifting and a 12-year-old was arrested on suspicion of robbery.

All three have since been released on police bail and have conditions not to attend the shop or be in contact with each other.
