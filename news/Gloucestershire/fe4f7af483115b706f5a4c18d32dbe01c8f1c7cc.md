Officers are appealing for witnesses to a fatal single vehicle collision which took place in the Chalford area of Stroud last night (Sunday 12 July).

Police were called to Tanglewood Way in Chalford at approximately 9.05pm following reports of a single vehicle collision involving a motorcyclist.

Paramedics attended but sadly the rider of a Honda motorcycle, a 24 year old man from the Stroud area, was pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin has been informed.

The road was closed for a number of hours whilst collision investigators remained at the scene and reopened during the early hours of this morning.

Investigating officers are appealing for witnesses to the collision who haven't already spoken to police as well as anyone who may have been in the area and has dashcam or CCTV footage.

Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting incident 496 of 12 July.
