Police are appealing for information after a man was seen to be in possession of a number of charity boxes that are believed to have been stolen.

On Sunday 29 November, a member of the public reported seeing an unknown man opening and emptying three charity boxes on Kiln Court in Gloucester and officers believe that they may have previously been stolen.

Investigating officers have so far been unable to identify where the charity boxes were stolen from and there is a chance that the thefts have not been reported to police.

Businesses in the area are asked to please contact police if they have had a charity tin or box stolen from their premises.

Anyone who has information can report this through the Constabulary's website quoting incident 108 of 29 November: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/contact/af/contact-us/us/a-crime-that-has-already-been-reported/

Alternatively you can call 101 quoting the incident number or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
