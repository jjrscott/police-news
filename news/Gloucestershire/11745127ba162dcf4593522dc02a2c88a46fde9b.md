Officers are appealing for information after a number of items were stolen during a burglary in Southam earlier this week.

Police were called to Southam Lane shortly after 3.15pm on Tuesday (2 February) after it was reported that offenders had gained entry to a property before leaving with money and jewellery.

The items of jewellery that were stolen include a Cameo brooch depicting 2 angels, a pearl floral spray brooch with a 48mm long safety chain, a Skagen Freja 2 handed silver tone steel mesh watch which has a blue face and was packed up in a box.

A number of rings were also stolen and are described as follows: a gold ring with two diamonds and one sapphire, a gold ring with three diamonds, two gold rings with five diamonds set into the band and one gold wedding band.

A beige holdall was also stolen and it is believed that this was used to take the jewellery away in.

Anyone who witnessed the burglary taking place or has been offered any of the stolen jewellery for sale is asked to contact police quoting incident 319 of 2 February.

This can be done by completing the following online form or calling 101: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/
