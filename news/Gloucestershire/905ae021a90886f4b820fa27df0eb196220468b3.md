A man was arrested yesterday (Monday) after police received a report that a homeowner in Bishops Cleeve had disturbed offenders in their property.

Officers were called to Moreton Close shortly before 1.10pm and conducted searches of the area after the individuals left in a car but were unable to locate anyone.

The vehicle was later stopped after being sighted on the M40 by our colleagues in Thames Valley and the 43-year-old man from Wolverhampton was arrested on suspicion of burglary and possession of class A drugs.

He currently remains in police custody whilst enquiries are ongoing.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police quoting incident 223 of 1 February.
