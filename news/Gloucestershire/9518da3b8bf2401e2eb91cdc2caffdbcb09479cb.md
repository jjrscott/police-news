Officers are appealing for witnesses to a burglary which took place in Lechlade yesterday afternoon (Monday).

Police were called to Downington near Lechlade shortly after 5.30pm following reports that a homeowner had returned home to find that someone had broken in.

The offenders are not believed to have stolen any items during the burglary which took place between 2.30pm and 5.30pm however officers would like to hear from anyone who witnessed suspicious activity in the area around these times.

If you have any information or would like to report suspicious activity please call 101 quoting incident 368 of 16 December.

We are currently running an anti-burglary campaign and would encourage the public to look at installing a 'WIDE' combination of security devices as they can provide 49 times more protection against residential burglary with entry compared to having no devices installed.

A 'WIDE' combination includes; Window locks, Internal lights on sensors, Double or door deadbolts and External lights on sensors.

More information on the campaign and ways to protect your home can be found by visiting: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/police-forces/gloucestershire-constabulary/areas/gloucestershire/campaigns/campaigns/2019/burglary/
