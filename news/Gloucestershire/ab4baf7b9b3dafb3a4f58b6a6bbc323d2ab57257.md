A man from Stroud has been sentenced to three years and four months in prison following an investigation by Gloucestershire Constabulary's Force Crime Operations team.

Everel Douglas, 36 and of Margarets Hill Place received the sentence at Gloucester Crown Court last Friday (20 November) after previously pleading guilty to possession with intent to supply Crack Cocaine.

Suspicions were raised about Douglas after officers received intelligence that a man using the name "Andre" was dealing class A drugs in Stroud, using a particular telephone number.

"Andre" was identified as Douglas after he had used that name in a previous drugs supply case in Stroud.

On Monday 19 October, an off duty officer saw a Black Vauxhall Astra, which is registered to Douglas parked in the Butterrow Hill area of Stroud and a suspected drug deal was witnessed.

Officers returned the following day and another drug deal was witnessed between Douglas and an unknown individual.

Due to this Douglas was stopped and searched by an officer where he was found to be in possession of two mobile phones and a quantity of bank notes, later counted to be over £500.

Officers conducted a search in the area and found a plastic chewing gum pot tucked into a tree which contained multiple wraps of believed class A drugs. These drugs were wrapped and prepared into 28 street sized deals with a street value of at least £580.

He was subsequently arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs before being charged with these offences.

Detective Constable Tom Medcroft said: "This was a simple possession with intent to supply Crack Cocaine case and the proactive patrols of my team have allowed us to take a prolific drug dealer off the streets of Stroud.

"We urge anyone who has concerns about drug dealing to let us know so that we can conduct enquiries and take the appropriate course of action that is required."
