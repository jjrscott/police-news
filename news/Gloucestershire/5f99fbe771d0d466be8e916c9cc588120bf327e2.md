Gloucestershire Constabulary is appealing for information after a man aged in his 60s was assaulted in Coopers Hill, near Brockworth on Monday morning, 17 February.

The man was walking up Coopers Hill at around 11am where there was a woman with a child who had around six dogs off lead, including a Bullmastiff. The dogs jumped up at the man who asked the female to make the dogs stop and there was a verbal argument.

As the man went to walk back to his car he was then approached by a male who punched him in the body, grabbed him and then stole his phone. It is thought the man was driving a red Citroen Berlingo or Peugeot Partner style van, with either a 54 of 64 registration plate.

This man is described as a white man aged around 40-years-old and was wearing tracksuit trousers and a blue or black waterproof jacket. The woman with the dogs is described as a white woman, also around 40-years-old and was wearing jeans.

Investigating officers are appealing for anyone who recognises the description of either the man or woman, or any witnesses to the incident, to call police on 101 and quote incident 161 of 17 February.

Information can also be submitted to police online through their 'update a crime report' form on their website: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/

You can also give information anonymously to independent crime-fighting charity Crimestoppers by calling 0800 555 111.
