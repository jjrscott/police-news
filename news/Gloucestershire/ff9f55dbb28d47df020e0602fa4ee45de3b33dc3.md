Officers from Gloucestershire Constabulary's Roads Policing Unit are appealing for witnesses to a serious collision which took place on the B4066 Taits Hill near Dursley shortly before 6pm yesterday.

The collision involved a single vehicle, a black Subaru Legacy estate, which was travelling from the A38 close towards Stinchcombe and Dursley when it left the road, hitting a tree and catching fire, trapping the occupants inside.

There are not believed to have been any other vehicles involved.

Officers from the Special Constabulary attended the scene within minutes of it being reported, and with the assistance of members of the public, attempted to extinguish the fire and managed to pull the driver and front seat passenger from the car.

The occupants of the car, a 39-year-old woman from the Swindon area and a 38-year-old man from the Dursley area sustained serious injuries and were taken to Southmead Hospital in Bristol where they remain.

Officers would like to speak to anyone who may have witnessed the collision, seen the Subaru shortly before the collision occurred or who may have travelled the route and has dash-cam footage that will assist with the investigation.

Witnesses are asked to call 101 quoting incident 400 of 23 October or submit information online: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/soh/something-youve-seen-or-heard/

Officers investigating the collision would like to praise the quick thinking actions of the members of public and their colleagues in the Special Constabulary and thank them for their assistance at the scene. None of the members of public or officers from the Special Constabulary sustained serious injuries as a result of the fire or assisting with the collision.
