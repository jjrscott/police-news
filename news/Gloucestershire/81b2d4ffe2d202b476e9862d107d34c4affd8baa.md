Several poorly dogs have been saved and a number of potentially stolen dogs recovered as part of a multi-agency operation this morning (Friday 12 February).

Responding to information received, the Constabulary, Stroud District Council and RSPCA joined forces to execute a warrant at a location on Naas Lane in Quedgeley.

A man was arrested on suspicion of theft in connection with the investigation.

The RSPCA has now taken the two poorly dogs to a vet for treatment while six stray dogs were seized by Stroud District Council.

Police have recovered 15 adult dogs whose ownership could not be proven.

Breeds and microchips are now being checked to try and establish who owns the dogs and enquiries continue.

Detective Chief Inspector Claire Nutland said: "If we establish these dogs are likely to have been stolen and cannot trace an owner then we will issue further details and pictures.

"I hope this demonstrates how seriously we take the wellbeing of all animals.

"As a part of the Police and Crime Commissioner's priority of 'A Compassionate Approach', officers will always investigate reports of dog theft and neglect."

A spokesperson from Stroud District Council said: "Stroud District Council takes the welfare of pets very seriously and our Animal Welfare Team worked in tandem with Gloucestershire Police and RSPCA in order to protect these dogs.

"Stroud District Council's Animal Welfare Charter supports the view that all animals have the right to a life free from cruel treatment and unnecessary suffering, and we will act on concerns anyone may have about animals in our district."

The arrested man, 55 and from Gloucester, remains in police custody at this time.
