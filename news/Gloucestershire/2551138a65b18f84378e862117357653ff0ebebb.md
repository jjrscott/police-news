Four men are in police custody today (Friday 3 July) after being arrested on suspicion of shoplifting offences last night.

Police were called to the BP Garage on Ashchurch Road in Tewkesbury shortly before 8.25pm following reports of an incident where four men had forced their way into the shop before stealing items from inside and leaving in a car.

Officers attended the garage and followed the car onto the M5 before the vehicle was located on the Golden Valley in Cheltenham.

The car was subsequently stopped by a single crewed officer and the men, aged 33, 36, 41 and 67 were arrested after a large quantity of food and alcohol was seized from within the vehicle.

The men remain in custody pending further enquiries.
