Two men sustained significant facial injuries following an altercation in Cheltenham earlier this month and police are appealing for further witnesses to come forward.

In the early hours of Sunday 18 October two men aged in their 20s and from Cheltenham were assaulted on Tivoli Road, near the junction with Andover Road, which has resulted in them both requiring ongoing hospital treatment.

Police are investigating the incident which is thought to have been a fight involving numerous people and started just after midnight and continued for up to 15 minutes.

After the fight three or four men left the scene in a white Vauxhall Corsa.

A 20-year-old man from Gloucester later attended a police station and was arrested on suspicion of assault. He was released under investigation pending further enquiries.

House to house enquiries have taken place and officers are appealing for anyone else who was in the area at this time and has not yet spoken to police to make contact.

Investigating officers are also keen to hear from any motorists who may have been in the area and have dashcam footage of the assault.

Anyone with information is asked to submit this to police online by completing the update a crime report form and referencing incident 11 of 18 October: https://www.gloucestershire.police.uk/tua/tell-us-about/cor/tell-us-about-existing-case-report/.
