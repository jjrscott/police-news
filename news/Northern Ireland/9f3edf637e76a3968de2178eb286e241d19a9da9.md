* Belfast

Earlier today, a 33 year old man from Belfast was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment, half to be served in custody and half on licence, after being convicted of domestic abuse offences.

The man pled guilty to common assault and attempting to choke his partner with intent to commit false imprisonment in December 2018.

Detective Constable Crawford said: "Domestic abuse is a terrifying crime and perpetrators should be aware that there are penalties and consequences for abusive actions within relationships including being locked up behind bars. I encourage anyone suffering from domestic abuse to come forward and speak to detectives in PSNI's Public Protection Branch. We will treat you with sensitivity and respect."
