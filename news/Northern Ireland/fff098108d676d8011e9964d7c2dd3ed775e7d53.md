Police in Bangor have arrested a 17 year old male on suspicion of a number of offences including attempted robbery, possession of a blade and burglary.

It follows an incident during which a knife was held to the throat of a man yesterday, Wednesday 28 March.

He remains in custody this morning assisting police with their enquiries.
