Earlier today, 32 year old Kevin McDaid was sentenced to four years imprisonment, half to be served in prison and half to be served on licence and was given a five year restraining order after being convicted of a catalogue of domestic abuse.

Kevin pled guilty to false imprisonment, making threats to kill, seven counts of common assault, two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (AOABH) and three of criminal damage in connection with incidents in 2017 involving his then partner. He also entered a guilty plea to another count of AOABH in relation to an assault on another person and was sentenced to nine months imprisonment to run concurrently.

Detective Sergeant Colin Neill said: "Domestic abuse is a terrifying crime which has a long lasting impact on survivors. It takes a lot of strength and fortitude to come forward and make a complaint, and to see that complaint through the criminal justice system. Perpetrators should be aware that there are penalties and consequences for abusive actions within relationships including being locked up behind bars. I hope anyone who is currently suffering is assured that they can come forward and speak to us and that detectives in PSNI's Public Protection Branch will treat you with sensitivity and respect."
