Detectives are appealing for information following the report of a paramilitary style shooting in the Pembroke Loop Road area of Dunmurry.

Detective Sergeant Wilson said: “Police are investigating the shooting of a 18 year old male in the area of Pembroke Loop Road, Dunmurry at approximately 8.15pm last night. The male was shot twice and was taken to hospital where he received treatment for leg injuries sustained during this violent crime. This was a brutal and despicable attack, which has left the young victim with potentially life changing injuries. It is yet another example of how criminal groups seek to control communities through fear and violence.”

“I would appeal to anyone who may have noticed any suspicious activity in the area of Pembroke Loop Road, to contact Detectives at Musgrave Criminal Investigation Branch on the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 1568 23/12/17. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.”
