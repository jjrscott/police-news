Detectives investigating the report of a burglary at a house in the Ballykelly area yesterday, Friday 19 October, are appealing for witnesses and information.

Detective Sergeant Chris Wilkinson said: "We received a call around 9:25pm last night that entry had been gained to a house in the Loughermore Road area. It was reported that rooms had been ransacked and a sum of money had been stolen. Jewellery was also reported stolen, including a wedding ring, a watch and earrings.

"It's believed this occurred sometime between 8:30pm and 9:10pm yesterday evening.

"I want to make a number of appeals today. Were you in the area between these times? Did you notice any strange activity in the area, including any vehicles being driven in a suspicious matter? Have you been offered jewellery for sale in suspicious circumstances?

“If you have information you believe may assist our investigation, call detectives in Coleraine on the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference number 1342 of 19/10/18.”

Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.
