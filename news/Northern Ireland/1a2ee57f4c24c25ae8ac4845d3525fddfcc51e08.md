* Derry City & Strabane

Detectives in Derry/Londonderry are appealing for witnesses following an incident where a shot was fired at a house in the area of Shearwater Way in the Waterside area last night, Sunday 20th August.

Detective Inspector Jack said: "It was reported that three masked men called to the house at around 10pm last night before firing a shot through the bedroom window. There are no reports of any injuries, however there were five children between the ages of three and eleven in the property at the time and they have been left traumatised by the incident having witnessed the attack.

"We are working with partner agencies to ensure that these children and the rest of the family in the home at the time, receive what support and assistance they need.

"Our investigation is at an early stage and we are following a number of lines of enquiry into a motive for the attack.

"We are appealing for anyone who may have CCTV footage in Shearwater Way or the surrounding area and anyone who was driving in the area who has dash cam footage available, or anyone with any information that may help the investigation to contact detectives in Strand Road on 101 quoting reference 1940 of 20/10/19."

Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.
