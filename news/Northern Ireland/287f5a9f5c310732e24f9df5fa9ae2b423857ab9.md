Police investigating the suspicious device found following a security alert in Seaforde over the weekend have confirmed it is a suspected component part of a mortar.

District Commander Superintendent Norman Haslett said: "Following forensic examination we can confirm the device is suspected to be a component part of a mortar although no explosives were found within the device.

"Whilst at this stage, it is too early to attribute ownership to any particular grouping, it is my belief that dissident republican terrorists are responsible.

"The matter remains under investigation and I would appeal for anyone with information to contact detectives on 101 or anonymously through the Crimestoppers charity on 0800 555 111."
