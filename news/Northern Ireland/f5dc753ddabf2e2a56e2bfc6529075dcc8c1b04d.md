* Belfast

Detectives are appealing for information following a burglary in Sharman Gardens in south Belfast on the evening of Wednesday 4 November.

Sometime between 9pm and 11pm entry was gained to the house through an unlocked front door. A handbag, purse, wallet and a number of other items were taken, some of which were discovered discarded a short distance away.

Detectives believe this burglary may be linked to another break-in in Sharman Close which also took place overnight.

Anyone with information regarding this crime can contact police on 101, quoting reference 651 05/11/20.

Detectives are also urging local people to be vigilant against burglars s the darker evenings draw in, and to take extra care to keep homes and belongings safe. Close and lock all doors and windows, consider security lights. To a burglar, a dark house is an empty house.

If you have older relatives or neighbours help them to keep their property and belongings secure.

Advice and assistance with crime prevention can be obtained by visiting the PSNI website or by calling 101 and requesting a visit from your local Crime Prevention Officer.
