Today, Monday, 3 February, at Laganside Crown Court 38-year-old Marek Sinko was sentenced for the manslaughter of his uncle, 53-year-old Eugeniusz Sinko, in the home they both shared in Rasharkin.

Marek was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment, half to be served in custody and half on licence.

Detective Chief Inspector Peter Montgomery from PSNI's Major Investigation Team said: "Eugeniusz and his nephew, Marek Sinko, had got into a fight with each other in their home on the night of Saturday, 21 October 2019. Eugeniusz sustained multiple blunt force injuries to his head, chest, back and arms.

"This was a senseless fight between an uncle and nephew which led to the death of Eugeniusz.

"I know that today's sentencing will not bring Eugeniusz back to his family, who have had to live through the nightmare of a nephew having killed his uncle, however, I hope it will bring some level of closure for them."
