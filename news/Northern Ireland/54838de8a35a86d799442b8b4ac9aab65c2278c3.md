As part of an ongoing operation into suspected drugs criminality linked to the INLA, detetives from the Paramilitary Crime Task (PCTF) assisted by officers from west Belfast Local Policing Team searched a house in the west Belfast area last night, (Tuesday, February 24).

During the search of the property, police seized a firearm, ammunition, a Taser, suspected Cocaine, amphetamine and Cannabis, quantity of cash and other items.

A 23 year old man was arrested on suspicion of suspicion of possession of a class A drug, possession of a class B drug and firearms offences and possessing criminal property. He is currently in custody at this time.

Detective Inspector Hamilton said: ""I am pleased to report the seizure of this firearm and ammunition to the people of west Belfast and indeed the wider community. We have removed the ability of these criminals to terrorise members of the community and our city is undoubtedly a safer place today as a result.

Drugs cause untold harm in our communities and last night's search is further evidence that PCTF are proactively pursuing drug criminals who prey on vulnerable members of our community. We will continue to listen to the public and act on the information they provide us, to target those criminals, involved in the sale and supply of illegal drugs at every opportunity.

I would encourage members of the public with information regarding criminal activity to call 101, or you can submit a report online using our non-emergency reporting form via http://www.psni.police.uk/makeareport/ .

"The independent charity Crimestoppers can also be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111 or online at http://crimestoppers-uk.org/."
