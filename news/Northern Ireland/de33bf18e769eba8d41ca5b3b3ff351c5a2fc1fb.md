* Antrim & Newtownabbey

A man has been arrested on suspicion of a range of offences after a taxi driver was robbed at gunpoint in Antrim.

The driver had picked up his fare of two males and a female in the Ballymena Road area at 00.30 this morning and took them to Junction One. Once there the male front seat passenger brandished a firearm and demanded money before striking the driver in the face with the weapon.

The trio then made off.

A short time later reports of a break in at a burger van in the Springfarm area and criminal damage at a shop on the Ballymena Road were received and a 20 year old man was arrested.

He remains in custody this morning.

Anyone with information that could assist the investigation is asked to contact the Reducing Offending Unit in 101, quoting reference 45 18/07/19
