Robbery - Boucher Road, Belfast

Detectives are appealing for information following an armed robbery of commercial premises at a retail park on the Boucher Road, Belfast this morning, Thursday, 21 April.

At approximately 7.05am Police received a report that four males armed with knives and what is believed to be a firearm entered the premises. Three men tied up the two members of staff and made off with a sum of money.

It is believed they left the scene in a white van in the direction of Boucher Crescent.

The members of staff were not injured, however they were left very badly shaken.

Detective Inspector Nigel Snoddy would appeal to anyone who was in this area and may have witnessed any suspicious activity to contact Detectives at Reactive and Organised Crime Musgrave on the non-emergency number 101. Or, if someone would prefer to provide information without giving their details they can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800 555 111.
