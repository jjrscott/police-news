* Newry, Mourne & Down

Police in Newry are appealing for witnesses to a serious road traffic collision on the A1 carriageway on Tuesday 18th July to come forward.

Inspector Denise Graham said: “Shortly after 12.30pm on the afternoon of Tuesday 18th July, police received a report of a single vehicle collision on the A1 carriageway, just outside Newry, near the Sheepbridge complex. A blue Toyota Rav 4 car, which had been travelling northbound, crashed through the central reservation, ending in the southbound carriageway. The driver, a man aged 50, was taken to hospital, where he remains in a critical condition. The A1 was closed in both directions for a number of hours following the collision.”

“ I am appealing today for anyone with any information or who witnessed the collision or has dashcam or mobile phone footage from the scene to contact police at Ardmore on 101 quoting reference number 512 18/07/17.”
