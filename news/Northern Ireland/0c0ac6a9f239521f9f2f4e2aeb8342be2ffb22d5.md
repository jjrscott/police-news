* Belfast

Detectives are appealing for witnesses and information following the report of an arson attack on a house in the Silverstream Parade area of Belfast at approximately 4.40 am this morning, Saturday, 30 March.

Detective Sergeant Corrigan said: "We are extremely fortunate that no-one was in the house at the time of this incident. Whoever carried out this reckless attack showed total disregard for the occupant and other residents in the area. They did not care who could be killed or injured.

"Did you notice any suspicious activity or vehicles in the area? If you did, please contact detectives at Musgrave on the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 319 30/03/19. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime."
