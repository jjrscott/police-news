A murder investigation has been launched following the death of a man who was assaulted in Belfast city centre early this morning, Sunday 2 April.

Detective Chief Inspector Geoffrey Boyce is continuing to appeal for witnesses, “We know that a large number of people were in the vicinity of the Donegall Street/Waring Street junction at around the time the altercation took place.

I would appeal to those people who have not yet gotten in touch with the investigation team to please do so. We are keen to gather as much information as possible about the circumstances and events that occurred here early this morning.

Investigators can be contacted by calling 101 and quoting reference number 94 02/04/17.”
