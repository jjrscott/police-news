* Belfast

Detectives from PSNI’s Organised Crime Branch have charged five people with drugs and immigration offences after cannabis with an estimated street value of £2 million was located during a proactive operation earlier this week.

Four men aged 28, 39, 46 and 59 and a woman aged 34, are due to appear at Belfast Magistrates Court today, on Saturday 1st December.

Detective Superintendent Bobby Singleton said the operation which targeted seven addresses in the greater Belfast area demonstrates PSNIs “commitment to removing dangerous drugs from our communities.” He added that detectives were following “several lines of enquiry, one is a potential link to a Triad organised crime gang and another is potential links to paramilitary groups.

“We will continue to investigate those who profit from the misery and harm caused by illegal drugs. Drug dealers are parasites who don’t care about their communities. I would appeal to the public to contact police if they have any concerns or information regarding drugs in their area by calling 101. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.”
