Police Service of Northern Ireland Memorial Garden Officially Opened by HRH Prince of Wales and HRH The Duchess of Cornwall

His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales and Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cornwall have officially opened the Police Service of Northern Ireland’s Memorial Garden and unveiled the Police Service of Northern Ireland’s Book of Remembrance today, Wednesday 10 May at Brooklyn, Police Headquarters, Belfast.

In the Memorial Garden and Book of Remembrance have recorded the names of police officers who have died or have been killed directly as a result of their employment in the Police Service of Northern Ireland.

Speaking at the opening of the Garden, Chief Constable George Hamilton said: “This is a very special, but also sad day, for the families and PSNI as we remember those who have died. I am delighted that HRH Prince of Wales and HRH The Duchess of Cornwall have officially opened our Memorial Garden and unveiled the Book of Remembrance. This is a fitting tribute to our colleagues who have died in the course of their service and will ensure that their dedication to duty and sacrifice is never forgotten.

“The visit was also an opportunity for HRH Prince of Wales and HRH Duchess of Cornwall to meet personally with the family members of those who had died and lay a wreath and flowers in their memory.”

The visitors also met with police officers and police staff based in Police Headquarters and invited guests. HRH Duchess of Cornwall was presented with a posy of flowers by seven year old Victoria Grieves whose father Constable Gary Grieves died in a Road Traffic Collision as he was travelling home from duty in August 2010.
