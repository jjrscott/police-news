Fatal house fire - Hillsborough Road, Carryduff on 2 September 2014

Detective Sergeant Ian Davis, from the PSNI’s Serious Crime Branch, said: “The reckless act carried out by the defendant led to the needless death of a much loved father, grandfather and great grandfather.

“Police carried out a rigorous investigation and in partnership with the PPS gathered the evidence required to bring about this defendant’s guilty plea.

“This was a tragic case and the thoughts of the investigation team are very much with Mr Carson’s family today.

**Family Statement:**

The Carson family are disappointed by the sentence handed down by the Judge today however they are glad that this now brings closure to the terrible circumstances of their father Samuel Carson’s death and would ask for privacy from the media now to allow them to get on with their lives.
