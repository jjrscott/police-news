Be Cyber Savvy

Officers from PSNI’s Reactive and Organised Crime Department are encouraging local people to be cyber savvy.

Detective Chief Inspector James Mullen said: “Social media has opened up new and unprecedented ways for people to connect and engage with one another however with this freedom come some potential risks.

As a police service we’ve had reports from individuals who have fallen victim to blackmail conducted via social media. We’re also being contacted by young men and women who have been duped into sending images and videos to fake modelling agencies and so called ‘talent scouts’ on various social media platforms.

My message today is simple - never post or send images to anyone via social media that you would not be happy to have viewed publicly, particularly nude or nearly nude images or videos - remember there is always a chance those images could be shared.

Finally I would appeal directly to anyone who has had an online interaction that has made them uncomfortable, worried or troubled, to please tell police about it. Your local officers can be contacted any time 24/7 by calling 101. In an emergency police can be reached via 999.”
