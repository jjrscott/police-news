* Belfast

Police are appealing for witnesses after an arson attack at an office building on the Andersonstown Road in west Belfast during the early hours of this morning, Monday 20 August.

Inspector McCullough said: "The fire was reported to us at around 4:50am. Police attended along with the Northern Ireland Fire & Rescue Service, who extinguished the blaze.

“Damage was caused to a door at the rear of the building, and to fascia boarding. There was no damage reported to the inside of the building. Paint was also thrown at a front window of the building.

"This is being treated as arson and I am appealing to anyone who was in the area around this time and noticed any suspicious activity, or anyone who has information which could assist our investigation to contact us on the non emergency number 101, quoting reference 162 of 20/08/18.

"Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.”
