Aggravated burglary - King William III Crescent, Maghera

Detectives are appealing for information following an aggravated burglary that occurred in the King William III Crescent area of Maghera on the evening of Thursday 19 May.

At approximately 10.20pm, three masked men pushed their way into a flat and one of them assaulted a 20 year old man with a stun gun. It is believed that the three men made off in a red car in the direction of Gulladuff.

Detective Inspector Will Tate said: "I would ask anyone who knows anything about this incident to contact detectives at Cookstown Police Station on the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference number 1357 of 19/05/16. Or if someone would prefer to provide information without giving their details, they can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800 555 111."
