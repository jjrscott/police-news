Yesterday, Monday, 24 August, 62 year old Brian Gillan pleaded guilty to blackmail (extortion) at Belfast Crown Court.

Detective Chief Inspector Cummings of the Paramilitary Crime Task Force (PCTF) said: "This has been a complex case involving officers from across the Police Service of Northern Ireland, all working hard to gather evidence in order to place Brian Gillan before the Court.

"Yesterday Brian Gillan admitted to extorting money from a local building contract."

"Yesterday's conviction is not only a result of excellent work by PCTF officers, but it also reflects the clear commitment of the victims to stand-up against this form of paramilitary criminality."

"We will now await the sentencing."
