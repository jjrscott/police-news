"At the same time, it was reported a number of other vehicles in the vicinity had also been sprayed with orange-coloured paint.

“We now know a total of 17 vehicles were damaged. Our enquiries are continuing and we are working to establish a motive for the attacks.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area around this time on Saturday night and witnessed any suspicious activity , or any drivers who were in the area around this time and have a dash cam fitted in their vehicles to check their footage. Anyone with information is asked to contact police in Ardmore on the non emergency number 101, quoting reference number 1487 of 28/07/18.
