Police in Mid Ulster have seized suspected drugs with an estimated street value of Â£20,000 during a proactive operation in Cookstown.

The suspected Class A and Class B drugs, namely cocaine and cannabis, were seized by District Support Team officers during a search of a vehicle in the Chapel Street area of the town on Thursday, (5th March).

A man, aged 23 years old, was subsequently arrested on suspicion of offences including possession of a Class A controlled drug with intent to supply, possession of a Class B controlled drug and possession of a Class B controlled drug with intent to supply. He has since been released on bail pending further enquiries.

Sergeant David Cochrane said: "We are fully committed to tackling the scourge of drugs in our communities, and we will continue to proactively investigate and carry out searches linked to the drugs trade.

"We are determined to disrupt their activity and anyone involved in the drugs trade, or anyone tempted to become involved should be under no illusion - we will seek to identify them, arrest them and place them before the courts.

"I would appeal to anyone who can help us identify suspects or lines of enquiry to call the non-emergency number 101. Alternatively, information can also be given anonymously to the Crimestoppers charity on 0800 555 111."
