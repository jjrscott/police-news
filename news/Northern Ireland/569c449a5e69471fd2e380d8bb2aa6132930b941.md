* Belfast

Detectives are investigating the report of an aggravated burglary at a house in the North Queen Street area of Belfast on Monday 11th June.

Detective Sergeant Rory McPhillips said: “It was reported that a number of armed and masked men forced their way into the house at around 10.45pm on Monday night and assaulted the male occupant. The intruders, several of whom were reportedly carrying firearms, punched and kicked the occupant and struck him in the face with one of the firearms, fracturing his eye socket. A search was carried out of the house by men before they left, however, nothing was reported stolen.

I would appeal for anyone who noticed any suspicious activity in the North Queen Street area on Monday night, or who has any information about this incident to contact detectives in Musgrave on 101 quoting reference number 1252 12/06/18. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.”
