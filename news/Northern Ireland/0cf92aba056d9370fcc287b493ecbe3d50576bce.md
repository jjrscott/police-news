As part of an ongoing search operation into suspected drugs criminality linked to East Belfast UVF, officers from the Paramilitary Crime Task (PCTF) searched a house in the Braniel area of Belfast this morning (December 17th).

During the search, a substantial amount of suspected Cocaine, a high value watch and a vehicle were seized.

A 36 year old man has been arrested on suspicion of possession of a Class A drug, possession of a Class A Drug with Intent to Supply and possession of Criminal Property. He remains in custody at this time.

Detective Inspector Hamilton said: "This is the third search in an ongoing operation to tackle the harm caused by drug dealers linked to East Belfast UVF this week. These drug criminals, who hide behind the badge of paramilitaries are a scourge on society. They prey on vulnerable members of our community to line their own pockets, leaving a trail of misery in their wake.

"Information from members of the community is key to enabling us to gather an accurate picture of what is happening in our local communities. We are committed to making Northern Ireland a hostile environment to those engaged in drug dealing. I would reassure the public that we will continue to listen to the community and act on information they provide.

"If you have any information you can call 101, or you can submit a report online using our non-emergency reporting form via http://www.psni.police.uk/makeareport/ .

"The independent charity Crimestoppers can also be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111 or online at http://crimestoppers-uk.org/."
