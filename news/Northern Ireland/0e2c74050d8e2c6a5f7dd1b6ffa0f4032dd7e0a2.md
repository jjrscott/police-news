* Belfast

Police have issued a fresh appeal for witnesses following a serious road traffic collision on the city bound lane of the M2, close to the Fortwilliam roundabout in Belfast on Friday 6 July.

Inspector Gary Irvine said: “The collision, between a motorcycle and another vehicle, was reported to us at around 2.30pm.

“The motorway was closed for a time to allow the air ambulance to land.

 “The male motorcycle rider, who is in his 70s, was taken to hospital for treatment where he remains in a critical condition. The female driver of the other vehicle was not injured in the incident.

“I would ask anyone who saw what happened or has dash cam footage that could be useful to our investigation, to get in touch with us on the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference number 805 of 6/7/18.”
