Prison Officer injured in east Belfast bomb attack dies in hospital

The prison officer who was injured following the explosion of a device under his van on Friday 4 March has died in hospital this morning.

He has been named as 52 year old Adrian Ismay of Hillsborough Drive, Belfast.

Speaking at a press facility today at PSNI Headquarters, the Senior Investigating Officer Detective Chief Inspector Richard Campbell said;

"Today is one of profound sadness. This morning the 52 year old prison officer who was injured following the explosion of a device under his van on Friday 4 March died in hospital.

"Adrian Ismay was the father of three grown up daughters and had over 28 years service with the Prison Service. Our deepest sympathy is with his family, friends and colleagues at this sad time. At this stage, we are working to establish the exact cause of Adrian’s death.

"Adrian’s profession was simply to keep people safe and we will do everything possible to bring those responsible to justice.

"One man has been charged with attempted murder and causing an explosion with intent to endanger life and the investigation is continuing.

"This was a completely senseless attack which only serves to demonstrate the ruthlessness and recklessness of those opposed to peace and who live for violence.

"We are specifically keen to hear from anyone who may have any information about the movements of two specific vehicles which were seized by police during searches following the attack:

\- A red Citroen C3 SKZ6662 which is believed to have been used by those planting the device at 21 Hillsborough Drive at approximately 2.20am during the early hours of Friday 4 March.

\- And a silver Skoda Fabia KFZ2352 which is believed to have been used before and after the incident by those involved. In particular I am appealing for any sightings of this vehicle, on the move or parked up, between 7pm on the evening of Thursday 3 March and 4am during the early hours of Friday 4 March. It is my understanding that a male was dropped off in this vehicle in Pilot Street in the Docks area of Belfast at around 3am on Friday morning and I am appealing for anyone who saw this, or who knows the identity of this male to come forward to police.

"We continue to ask for anyone who may have any information to contact us on the non-emergency number 101 or on Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
