Statement by the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Simon Byrne QPM:

"I have advised the Chair of the Northern Ireland Policing Board that I have spoken to Martin Hewitt (Chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council) to request the appointment of an external senior Police Officer to oversee and direct the Police Service of Northern Ireland's investigation of potential breaches of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2020 at a funeral which took place on 30 June 2020. I have taken this decision to ensure independent oversight of the investigation.

"The Police Service of Northern Ireland is also in receipt of a complaint from a member of the public regarding Police actions leading up to the funeral on 30 June 2020. This has now been forwarded to the Police Ombudsman for her consideration."
