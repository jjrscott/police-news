Detectives are investigating an aggravated burglary at a flat in south Belfast.

Three men forced their way into the property on Ashley Avenue at around 11.30pm last night, Wednesday 11 December. The intruders assaulted two women (38 & 40) who were inside the property, using a stun gun on one of the victims, before tying up both.

The males ransacked the property and fled with a sum of cash.

Detective Sergeant Eric Fairfield said: "We are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information regarding this crime to get in touch. Please call 101, quoting reference 1989 11/12/19."
