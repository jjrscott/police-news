Officers from the Paramilitary Crime Task Force have arrested a 32 year old man following searches in East Belfast and Bangor.

Detective Sergeant Hawthorne said: “In a number of planned searches today, officers seized a quantity of Class C drugs including steroids as well as a sum of cash. A 32 year old man was arrested on suspicion of possessing a Class C drug with the intent to supply. He is currently in Musgrave custody suite where he is assisting police with our enquiries.

“Today’s search operation was in relation to an ongoing investigation into the activities of West Belfast UDA and demonstrates our commitment to removing and disrupting the illegal supply of drugs in Northern Ireland.

“We are actively tackling the issue of drugs and I would appeal to the public to speak to us if they have any concerns or information regarding drugs in their communities. I would ask anyone who is aware of any individual involved in the supply of drugs to contact their local police on 101.

"Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime."
