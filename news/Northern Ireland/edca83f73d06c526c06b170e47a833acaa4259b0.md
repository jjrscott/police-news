* Antrim & Newtownabbey

Detectives are investigating an attack on a house in Antrim.

Detective Sergeant Colin Gray said: “At around half past midnight it was reported that a number of masked males had damaged a property in Ardnaglass Gardens

It appears as though an attempt was made to force entry into the property by smashing the front door. The windows of a Volkswagen Golf parked outside were also smashed.

It’s believed the males made their escape in a Volkswagen Passat that was found burnt out in the Carneary Lane area a short time later.

At this time paramilitary involvement is one possible line of enquiry.

We would like to hear from anyone with information about this crime. Detectives can be contacted by calling 101, quoting reference number 32 18/08/17.”

Information can also be given anonymously to the Crimestoppers charity on 0800 555 111.
