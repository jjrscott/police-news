Woman's death not suspicious following post mortem

Following a post mortem examination, police are no longer treating as suspicious the death of a 36 year old woman at a house on Glenshane Road in Claudy.

The death was initially reported to police early on Saturday morning, 16 April.

Detective Chief Inspector Michael Harvey said: "A man arrested following the death has been released unconditionally."
