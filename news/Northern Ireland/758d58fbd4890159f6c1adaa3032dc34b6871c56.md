Detectives are investigating a gun attack in Derry/Londonderry overnight.

Detective Constable Richard Donnell said: “Shortly after 8pm it was reported that a masked man had fired a shotgun at a van in Clooneyville Avenue. The blast struck the rear of the van breaking the window and lodging pellets in the passenger head rest. Fortunately the 37 year old male driver, who was alone in the vehicle, was unharmed.

“We believe the gunman made his escape on foot along the alleyway that runs down the back of Bonds Street.

“Detectives are keen to speak to anyone who was in the Bonds Street, May Street, or Clooneyville Avenue areas at around 8pm on Monday night and who may have information that could assist the investigation. Please call 101, quoting reference 1193 26/11/18.

“Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.”
