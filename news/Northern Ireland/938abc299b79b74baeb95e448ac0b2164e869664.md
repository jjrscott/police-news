Hijacking - Colinwell Road, Dunmurry

Detectives are appealing for information following the hijacking of a car in the Colinwell Road area of Dunmurry last night, Thursday, 3 March.

Detective Inspector Martin Cummings said: "Shortly before 9.00pm as the female driver of a silver Hyundai was approaching the roundabout on the Brianswell Road to turn right onto Colinwell Road two males crossed in front of her vehicle, causing her to stop. One of these males got into the passenger seat. He produced a knife and told her to get out of her car, which she did. The second male got into the back of the car. They then made off in her vehicle.

"At approximately 9.15pm on the same date (Thursday, 3 March) the Hyundai was found burnt out in the Moyard Parade area of Belfast.

"The woman was not injured during this incident, however she was left very badly shaken."
