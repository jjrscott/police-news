Police investigating disorder and attacks on police at Distillery Street on Saturday, 8 August 2020 release further images

Police are today releasing images of people they wish to speak with in relation to disorder at Distillery Street, Belfast on Saturday 8 August.

Superintendent Melanie Jones said; "Today we are releasing 6 images of individuals that we would like to talk to in connection with our ongoing investigations into disorder during which 29 police officers were injured.

"By releasing these images I am hopeful that either the individuals themselves will contact police directly or the wider community can help us identify them.

"We are also aware of videos circulating relating to the disorder and are continuing to examine their contents.

"We are committed to identifying those involved in this significant disorder and we will be relentless in our pursuit in bringing offenders before the Courts.

"It is in everybody's interest - as well as in the interest of justice - that those responsible are dealt with appropriately and I would urge anyone who may have any information to bring it forward to Police at Musgrave police station by calling the non-emergency number 101. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, which is 100% anonymous."
