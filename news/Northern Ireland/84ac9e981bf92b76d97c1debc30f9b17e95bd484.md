Bike safely this Easter

On Good Friday last year one motorcyclist was injured on the roads in Northern Ireland.

That was one too many.

Assistant Chief Constable Barbara Gray said: “Before you take your motorcycle onto the roads this Easter please take the time to ensure your machine and safety equipment are in good working order.

“Drive responsibly and within the speed limits.

“I would ask other road users to be alert to the presence of motorcyclists on the roads, particularly when emerging from and turning into junctions.

“We all have a responsibility to make our roads safe.”
