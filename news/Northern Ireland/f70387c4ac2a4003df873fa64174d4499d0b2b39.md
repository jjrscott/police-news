Petrol bomb thrown at police - Castlemara Drive, Carrickfergus

A petrol bomb has been thrown at a police vehicle in Carrickfergus in the early hours of Sunday 22 May.

Inspector Mick Wood said: "The petrol bomb was thrown just after 1.05am while police were attending an rtc in the Castlemara Drive area. There were no injuries or damage caused however this attack should be condemned. The police service belongs to the whole community and police officers are there to serve and protect the whole community. A police officer should never come under attack while simply doing their job.

"I would ask anyone with any information about this incident to contact Larne Police Station on the non-emergency number 101. Or if someone would prefer to provide information without giving their details, they can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800 555 111."
