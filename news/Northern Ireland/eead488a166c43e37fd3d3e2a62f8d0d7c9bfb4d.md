Police appeal about four vehicles after Lisburn explosive device

Police appeal about four vehicles after Lisburn explosive device

Detectives investigating the explosive device found in Lisburn last Saturday are renewing their appeal for information.
The device was discovered in Market Place just before 2pm and the clearance operation to make it safe caused considerable disruption.
Detective Chief Inspector Alison Rowland, from Serious Crime Branch, said: “Extensive enquiries are ongoing and as yet we have been unable to identify how this device was in Market Place but we believe the target was an individual rather than a location.

"I am appealing for information from people who were in the Market Place area on Saturday 30 July around 2pm to contact us. We are particularly interested in speaking with the drivers of the following vehicles who we know were in that area on Saturday:

• Grey coloured BMW X3 or X5
• Blue coloured Ford Focus
• Grey coloured Vauxhall Astra
• Silver coloured Suzuki jeep

"Police will continue to proactively police Lisburn to prevent such attacks and would encourage public support to help us keep our community safe."

Detectives can be reached by calling 101 and asking for the Lisburn bomb enquiry team or, if people would prefer to provide information without giving their details, they can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800 555 111.

We are keen to hear from witnesses of this incident

The Police Service of Northern Ireland is appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident or anyone with any information that will assist the investigation to contact us on the non-emergency number 101. Information can also be passed anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
