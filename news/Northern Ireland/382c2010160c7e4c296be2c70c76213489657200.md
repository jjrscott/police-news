* Belfast

Detectives at Musgrave CID in Belfast are investigating a burglary in the Dunmurry area during the early hours of today (Saturday 9 March)

Detective Inspector Kerry Brennan said: "We received a report at 7:40am that entry was gained to a property in the Harris Crescent area sometime between 10pm last night (Friday 8 March) and the time it was reported to us. It was reported that rooms in the house were completely ransacked, and a white purse containing a sum of money was stolen.

"Thankfully, the sole occupant of the house - a woman who was in bed at the time - was not injured.

"This was a despicable act, which must have been frightening for the victim who was not only vulnerable but also completely helpless.

"It is disgusting that our older people should be targeted, and I am asking that anyone with information or who can help us identify the criminal involved, to please contact detectives at Musgrave on 101 quoting reference number 259 of 09/03/19 ."

Information can also be given to the Crimestoppers charity anonymously on 0800 555 11
