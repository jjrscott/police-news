Motorcyclist dies following collision - Glenariff

A 32 year old male motorcyclist has died in hospital following a collision on the Glenariffe Road, Gelnariff.

It’s understood the motorcycle he was riding struck a telegraph pole at around 6.20pm on Saturday 19 March.

Inspector Colin Shaw is appealing for witnesses to come forward: “We are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision, or anyone who may have seen a pair of motorcyclists travelling in the direction of Ballymena prior to the time of the collision.

The male, who sadly passed away, was travelling with a friend who was riding a second motorcycle. The second male was not involved in the collision.”

Witnesses can get in touch with police by calling the non-emergency number 101.
