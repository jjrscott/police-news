* Belfast

Detectives from PSNI Terrorism Investigation Unit investigating the attempted murder of a police officer in east Belfast on Saturday 01 June have made a further appeal for witnesses.

Detective Superintendent Sean Wright said: "This was an appalling, cowardly attack on not just a police officer but on the local community and Northern Ireland as a whole.

"I have already asked for people who were in the areas of Green Road, Knockhill Park, Upper Newtownards Road, Shandon Park and Shandon Park Golf Club anytime between 10pm on Friday 31 May and 7.30am on Saturday 1 June to come forward and I've encouraged anyone who lives in those areas and has CCTV to speak to my team.

"I have spoken about two vehicles that I'm interested in, both of which were found burnt out in Etna Drive in the early hours of Saturday morning - a green coloured Skoda Octavia, VRM 01D78089 and silver coloured SAAB 95, VRM NFZ 3216. I want to speak to anyone who saw them in the Ballyhackamore or Upper Newtownards Road area between midnight and 2am on Saturday 1 June. This was the early hours of Saturday morning when people will have been out socialising. The area will have been busy and I'd appeal to taxi drivers to consider if they have any dash-cam footage, to contact Terrorism Investigation Unit detectives on 101."
