Above and below: Some of the suspected drugs recovered from the M1.

Detectives from the Police Service's Organised Crime Unit have recovered suspected drugs, with an estimated street value of approximately Â£1 million following an incident on the M1 this morning (Saturday, 3rd October).

The suspected cannabis, which had been strapped on to the roof of a large horse box-type vehicle, was recovered after the lorry shed its load in the vicinity of Blacks Road junction at around 6:50am.

Detective Inspector Aubrey Shaw said: "This is a significant amount of drugs, which have been taken out of circulation. This will have a huge impact on the organised criminals involved in its importation, depriving them of commodity and, most importantly, profit.

"We are continuing with our enquiries, and I want to make a number of appeals about the vehicle involved, its movements and its whereabouts. At this time, the lorry has not been located.

"Were you on the M1, westbound in the Blacks Road junction area between 6:30am and 7am? Do you remember seeing the lorry? Did you witness the incident, or do you have dash cam footage of what occurred, of the vehicle and its movements? Do you know where this vehicle is now?
