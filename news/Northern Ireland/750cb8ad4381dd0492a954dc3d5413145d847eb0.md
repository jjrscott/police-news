Police investigating a two-vehicle road traffic collision on the Comber Road in Dundonald on Saturday, 10 November are appealing for witnesses.

Sergeant Jonny Mackenzie said: "The collision on the Comber Road, on the Dundonald side of the Billy Neill Sports Grounds, was reported to us at 1:10pm on Saturday and involved a grey-coloured Audi A3 and red-coloured Volkswagen Polo.

"Police, NIFRS and NIAS attended. The female driver, and sole occupant of the Polo, was taken to hospital with what have been described as life changing injuries. The driver and passenger in the Audi were also taken to hospital for what is believed to have been minor injuries.

"I want to make a number of appeals today.

"Were you driving along Comber Road, Dundonald - in either direction - between 12:30pm and 1:10pm on Saturday? Did you see either of these vehicles? Did you capture the collision on your dash cam?

â€œIf you have information you believe may assist our investigation, contact us on the non emergency number 101, quoting reference 679 of 10/11/18."
