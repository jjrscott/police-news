Detectives from PSNI Major Investigation Team have launched a murder investigation following the fatal shooting of a man in Warrenpoint last night.

Detective Chief Inspector Geoff Boyce said: “At approximately 7.30pm 37 year old Wayne Boylan was fatally shot in a property on Lower Dromore Road.

A 21 year old woman, who was also inside the property, sustained gunshot injuries. She was taken to hospital where her condition is believed to be critical.

A motive for the incident has not yet been established.

Detective Chief Inspector Boyce continued: “I would urge anyone who has any information to come forward. I would particularly like to hear from anyone who was in the area last night and who may have seen two men or any vehicles fleeing from the scene immediately after the shooting to contact the Major Investigation Team detectives on the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 1115 18/01/19.

Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.”
