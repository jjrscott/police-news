* Antrim & Newtownabbey

Detectives in Antrim investigating an attempted aggravated burglary in Newtownabbey during the early hours of this morning (Tuesday 13 November) are appealing for information.

Inspector Gilbert said: "We received a report at 2:20am that two men, at least one of them armed with what is believed to have been a hammer, approached the front door of a house in the Glenville Park area and attempted to enter the property. Damage was caused to glass in the door. The men failed to get into the house, and subsequently fled from the scene on foot.

"Both suspects are described as being 5' 10'' in height and both wore dark-coloured hooded tops.

"Three people in the house at the time, two adults and a young child, were uninjured.

"I am appealing to anyone who was in the area around this time and saw what happened, or anyone who has information they believe may assist our investigation to contact detectives in Antrim on the non emergency number 101, quoting reference 75 of 13/11/18."

Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.
