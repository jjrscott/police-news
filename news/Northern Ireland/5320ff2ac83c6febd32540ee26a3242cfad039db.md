* Derry City & Strabane

Police in Derry/Londonderry have welcomed an incident free night in the Bogside and Fountain areas of the city.

Chief Inspector Alan Hutton said: “I am pleased to say that the disorder we have seen on our streets in recent nights did not return last night. I would like to thank all those who have given their support to the end of the violence in our city, and I hope that we can all move forward from this point to a continued return to normality . We are, however, determined to bring those responsible for the disorder to justice, and over the coming days and weeks we will be identifying those involved, and making arrests.”

“A 17 year old male was arrested last night, on suspicion of possessing petrol bombs in suspicious circumstances, throwing a petrol bomb and riotous behaviour and he is currently in custody assisting us with our enquiries. A 16 year old male youth was also arrested yesterday on suspicion of attempted murder in relation to shots fired at police officers and also remains in custody at this time. My officers have made a further arrest today of a 16 year old male on suspicion of a number of public order offences and is also in custody at this time.“

“ I would ask anyone with information about the recent disorder, and those involved, to contact police at Strand Road on 101. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.”

Update - A 16 year old male youth arrested on suspicion of attempted murder following recent disorder in Derry/ Londonderry has now been released unconditionally.
