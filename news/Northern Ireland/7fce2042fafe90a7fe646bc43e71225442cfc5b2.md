* Belfast

A 37 year old man has been arrested following a proactive policing operation in the South Belfast area on Friday 24th July.

Sergeant Matt Boucher said: "Officers from the South Belfast Neighbourhood Policing Team carried out a search at a house in the area this afternoon and a quantity of suspected herbal cannabis and amphetamine, along with around Â£50,000 in cash and a BMW car, was seized as a result.

"The man was arrested on suspicion of possession of criminal property, possession of a class B controlled drug and possession of a class B controlled drug with intent to supply and is currently in custody assisting us with our enquiries.

"Tackling the illegal supply and use of drugs continues to be a priority for police and seizures such as this demonstrate our ongoing commitment to removing illegal drugs from our society.

"I would encourage anyone who has any information about the use or supply of illegal drugs to contact police on the non-emergency number 101 with any information they have. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime."
