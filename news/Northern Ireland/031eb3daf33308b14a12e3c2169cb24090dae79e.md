Detectives are appealing for witnesses following fires at two flats on New Lodge Road in north Belfast early this morning, Tuesday 14 August.

Shortly after 6am it was reported that a fire had been started in a flat in the area. Police and NIFRS attended and the fire was extinguished. While in attendance NIFRS discovered a fire in a second flat. Damage was caused to both flats as a result of the incident. Both flats were unoccupied at the time of the incident. A female in an adjoining flat was treated for the effects of smoke inhalation.

Detective Inspector Denis McGaffin stated: â€œWe are lucky not to be dealing with serious injuries or death as a result of this reckless action. A robust investigation has now commenced and I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the incidents or anyone with any information that can assist with the investigation to contact Detectives in Musgrave on 101 quoting reference 159 14/08/18. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime."
