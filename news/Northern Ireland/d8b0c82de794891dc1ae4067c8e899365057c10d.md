Family robbed at gunpoint in Lagmore - Dunmurry

Detectives are investigating an armed robbery at a house in the Lagmore area of Dunmurry.

Shortly after 10.45pm last night three masked males, two of whom were armed with handguns, forced their way the property in Glenfearna Gardens.

They threatened the three female occupants, aged 81, 49 and 25, with the firearms before tying the up the 49 year old.

The robbers then made off in a small silver vehicle with a substantial sum of cash.

Detective Constable Fiona Mills said: “This was a despicable act perpetrated against three generations of the one family.

All of these women have been left understandably extremely shaken and upset by the ordeal.

I am appealing for anyone with information about this appalling crime to get in touch with police on the non-emergency number 101.”
