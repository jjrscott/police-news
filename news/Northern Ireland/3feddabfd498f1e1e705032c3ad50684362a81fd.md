Detectives from the PSNI's Major Investigation Team have welcomed today's conviction of a Coleraine man for the murder of Omagh woman Charlotte Murray.

Detective Chief Inspector Eamonn Corrigan said: "I welcome today's conviction of 48 year old John Miller for the murder of Charlotte Murray.

"However, Charlotte's family still need to have her body home so they can give her a proper burial. They haven't seen her for seven years and deserve to be allowed to say goodbye to her.

"I would appeal to anyone who knows where Charlotte's body is to come forward and give the information to police so that we can return her to her family.

"Anyone with information should contact detectives on 101 or alternatively phone Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
