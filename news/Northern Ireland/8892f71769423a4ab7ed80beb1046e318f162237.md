* Mid & East Antrim

An on duty police officer has been injured after the vehicle he was driving was rammed in Carnlough.

Inspector Peter Duncan explains: "The officer was conducting a proactive patrol in the High Street and Harbour areas when he noted a vehicle he found suspicious. He approached the silver Jeep, positioning his unmarked police car in front of the suspect vehicle. He was attempting to alight when his patrol vehicle was rammed and almost pushed into the water. The Jeep then made off at speed.

The officer immediately pursued the suspect car but had to suspend the pursuit due to the extensive damage that had been caused to his police vehicle.

The Jeep was later found abandoned and has been seized for forensic examination. The injured officer sustained bruising and whiplash type injuries but continued with the rest of his shift.

I would commend the officer concerned for both his bravery and resilience and wish him a speedy recovery."
