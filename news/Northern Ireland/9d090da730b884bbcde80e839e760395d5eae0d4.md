PSNI assist HMRC in organised crime searches

Detectives from PSNI’s Reactive and Organised Crime Branch today assisted HMRC officials in searching six commercial premises in the Belfast and Newtownabbey areas.

Detective Inspector Pete Mullan said: “Today’s operation with HMRC was in relation to organised criminal activity during which we seized 6,000 cigarettes, nearly 2kg of tobacco and a substantial sum of money.

“This resulted from searches in five commercial premises in Belfast and one in Newtownabbey.”
