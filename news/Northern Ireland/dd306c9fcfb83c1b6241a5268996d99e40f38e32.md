Joint PSNI/HMRC Searches

Detectives from PSNI’s Reactive and Organised Crime Branch today assisted HMRC officials in searching six commercial premises in the Belfast and Newtownabbey areas.

Detective Inspector Pete Mullan said: “Today’s operation with HMRC was in relation to organised criminal activity during which we seized 6,000 cigarettes, nearly 2kg of tobacco and a substantial sum of money.

“This resulted from searches in five commercial premises in Belfast and one in Newtownabbey.”
