* Belfast

Police are investigating an arson attack at a house in Kingston Court in north Belfast during the early hours of this morning, Sunday 11 October.

Rubbish was placed at the rear of the property and set alight at around 1am. The fire then ruptured a gas line resulting in the evacuation of a number of nearby homes.

Detective Sergeant Natalie Moore said: "Fortunately the house was not occupied at the time however significant risk was posed to neighbouring properties and their occupants. Thankfully the emergency services arrived and were able to deal with the incident and move people away from danger before the fire spread.

I am keen to hear from anyone with information regarding this crime. Please call 101, quoting reference 126 11/10/20.
