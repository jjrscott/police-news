Police are warning members of the public to be wary of correspondence they receive regarding the International Fifa World Cup Online Lottery.

Detective Constable Crooks of the PSNI Economic Crime Unit is warning the public to be aware that this lottery scam is doing the rounds and police are aware that people in Northern Ireland are being targeted.

The letter advises the recipient that they have won £900,000 and provides contact details in order to process their supposed winnings.

Detective Constable Crooks said: These scams have been doing the rounds for many years, under the headings of Fifa World Cup, Euro Millions, Spanish (El Gordo) and many others. Here are some links for advice from Action Fraud:
