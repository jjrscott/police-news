Detectives investigating the report of a burglary in the Dungannon area last night (Saturday 3 November) have arrested a 27-year-old man in relation to the incident.

Detective Inspector Trevor Stevenson said: "We received a report around 8:50pm last night that entry was gained to a house in the town.

"The sole occupant of the house, a woman with severe physical disabilities, reported that a man had entered her bedroom. The suspect, described as 5' tall, aged in his 30s, with a full bushy beard and wearing a lightweight jacket and denim jeans, ransacked bedroom furniture, taking a sum of money and her mobile phone. He also searched other rooms in the house before fleeing through a window.

â€œWe believe this occurred sometime between 8:20pm and the time it was reported to us.

"A man, matching the description of the suspect, was arrested a short time later in the Market Square area of the town on suspicion of burglary and property was seized by police. He remains in custody assisting us with our enquiries.

"This was a despicable act, which must have been frightening for the victim who was not only vulnerable but also completely helpless. While not physically injured she has been left deeply traumatised by this horrific ordeal."
