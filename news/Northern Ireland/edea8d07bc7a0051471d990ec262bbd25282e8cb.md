Police are appealing for information following the report of a fire at an outdoor recreation and residential centre in the Donard Park area of Newcastle yesterday evening, Saturday 22 February.

Sergeant McIlveen said: "The fire, reported just before 7pm, was at a log cabin, used as a shelter or relaxation-type area.

"Officers attended, along with colleagues from Northern Ireland Fire & Rescue Service.

"Unfortunately the cabin has been completely destroyed by the fire, which is believed to have been started deliberately.

"Thankfully, there are no reports of injuries and no damage to the nearby main property.

"We are appealing to anyone with information to contact us on 101, quoting reference number 1541 of 22/02/20."

Information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime
