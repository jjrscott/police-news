PSNI Officers will support French Police for Euro 2016

A group of PSNI officers, led by an experienced superintendent, have been selected to work as part of an international policing team at this year's UEFA Euro 2016 Tournament in France.

Superintendent Nigel Goddard and his colleagues will be deployed to France, at the request of the French Authorities, for the duration of Northern Ireland’s involvement in the competition to support the French Policing Operation and help ensure a safe and trouble-free tournament.

Superintendent Goddard, who has been liaising with the National Police Chiefs Council, the IFA, French authorities and other international law enforcement agencies about the major football tournament said;

"For the first time in 30 years, Northern Ireland have qualified for the finals of a major football tournament and will be playing their first three group games in Nice, Lyon and Paris.

"PSNI will travel to assist and liaise with French Authorities in regard to their operations at all of the Northern Ireland games.

"Whilst in France we will liaise with the French Police Commanders to monitor fan behaviour in the cities, fan zones, on transport and at the stadiums and assist them when required in dealing with any potential problems.

"In preparation for the tournament we have also liaised closely with the Amalgamation of Official Northern Ireland Supporters’ Clubs.

He continued, "My colleagues and I will be there to provide a reassuring presence at each of the venue cities and will be identifiable as PSNI officers to Northern Irish fans."
