Armed Robbery - Crumlin

Detectives in Antrim are investigating an armed robbery at commercial premises at Main Street in Crumlin on Wednesday 6th April.

Three men armed with knives entered the travel agent shop at around 11am and threatened members of staff. A sum of cash was handed over and the men then left the shop and got into a waiting black coloured Citroen C5 car. The car was later recovered at Glendarragh Park in Crumlin at around 6.30pm. None of the staff members were injured as a result of the incident but were left shocked.

The first male involved was around 6â€™ tall and was wearing a dark hooded top with white sleeves and hood up, the second had a blue Adidas track suit hooded top and the third wore dark clothing with a hood.

Detective Inspector McCarron has appealed to anyone who witnessed this incident or who saw the black Citroen car with four men on board being driven in the Crumlin area on Wednesday to contact detectives in Antrim on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
