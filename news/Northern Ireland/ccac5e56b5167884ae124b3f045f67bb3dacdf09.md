Seven people arrested as part of operation against online fraud and money laundering

Detectives from PSNI's Economic Crime Unit have today arrested 7 suspected members of an Organised Crime Gang and carried out 10 searches at houses and premises as part of a proactive operation in relation to online fraud and money laundering.

Three men, aged 26, 55 and 69, and four women, aged 20, 34, 42 and 48, were arrested in the Belfast, Bangor and Downpatrick areas on suspicion of fraud by false representation, conspiracy to defraud and money laundering offences. They are currently assisting police with their enquiries. A number of high value items, including vintage cars, have been seized under the Proceeds of Crime Act as part of this operation to date.

Detective Inspector Katherine Montgomery, from the Economic Crime Unit, said: "The aim of this operation is to apprehend those allegedly involved in online fraud and money laundering. It comes after police received a substantial number of reports from victims who had been scammed online whilst believing they were purchasing high value goods from popular websites.

"These arrests reflect our continued commitment to dealing robustly with those involved in Fraud and Financial Crime and provide reassurance to the community that this type of organised crime will not be tolerated."

Anyone who believes they may have been a victim of a crime of this nature is asked to contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or use the online reporting tool at https://www.actionfraud.police.uk or to police on 101.
