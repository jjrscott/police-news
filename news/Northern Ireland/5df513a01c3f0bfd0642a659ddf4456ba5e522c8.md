Detectives are investigating a burglary at a clothing shop on Bedford Street in Belfast during the early hours of this morning, Saturday 4 April.

Detective Inspector Andy George said: "We received a report around 1.00am that a Vauxhall Corsa had reversed into the front door of the shop causing the window to shatter.

A number of suspects then removed items of clothing from the store placing them in the boot of the car.

Some of the clothes were recovered after they fell out of the vehicle as the thieves made their escape.

The vehicle, which had been reported stolen from the Newtownabbey area on Friday, was recovered a short time later in St Peters Court area of Belfast.

I am appealing for anyone with information regarding this crime to contact us. Police are aware that footage of this incident is circulating online and I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who has recorded dash-cam or mobile phone footage. Please call 101, quoting reference 1515 04/04/20."
