A PSNI officer won a coveted award at last night’s 2018 UK International Digital Investigation and Intelligence Awards.

Detective Constable Sean Deeney from Organised Crime Unit was amongst the winners which are judged by an independent panel compiled of senior stakeholders, subject matter experts and are awarded to law enforcement agencies demonstrating how critical digital investigation and intelligence capability has become in combatting both traditional and cyber-crime.

Detective Inspector Tom McClure said “In the case of DC Deeney he was the Digital Media Investigator in Operation Meris. The focus of this proactive investigation was a high level organised crime gang involved in the supply of large quantities of Class A and B controlled drugs to various crime gangs across Northern Ireland. The principal of the gang never 'got his hands dirty' and was directing and controlling this criminality from what he thought was a safe distance. DC Deeney in his role as DMI displayed exceptional levels of skill, tenancy and ingenuity in the use of communications data which was central to the successful conviction of this individual who was subsequently sentenced to nine years imprisonment.

DC Deeney was awarded first prize in the category ‘Exceptional Use of communication data in a complex investigation’. It is very rewarding to see the work of our officers being recognised in this way.”
