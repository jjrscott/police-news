Detectives are appealing for information following a report of an armed robbery at business premises at Carryduff Shopping Centre, Church Road, Carryduff last night, Thursday 14th March.

Detective Constable McMahon said: "Around 9.10pm, it was reported that two masked men entered the premises armed with what was described as a hammer, they threatened the member of staff and pushed him into the back of the property. The two males took a sum of cigarettes and money from the tills before making off from the scene carrying a recycling box. One member of staff was inside the premises at the time of the incident, but there were no reports of any injuries.

Both males are described as around 5ft4, with one wearing a grey tracksuit, scarf, hat and mask with face holes.

Enquiries are continuing and we would appeal to anyone who witnessed the incident, saw two males carrying a recycling box or who saw anything suspicious in the area at around 9.10pm last night to contact detectives on 101, quoting reference number 1334 14/3/19. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime."
