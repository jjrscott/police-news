Statement from Deputy Chief Constable Harris on Research into recruitment

Commenting on the research into police recruitment Deputy Chief Constable Drew Harris said: “We are committed to ensuring our workforce is totally representative of the community we serve and that we are seen as an employer of choice.

“Our last recruitment campaign in 2015 identified there had been a lower than expected number of applications from the Catholic community and again a lower than expected number of Catholic applicants being successful in the actual recruitment process.

“We commissioned Deloitte, our independent recruitment company, to undertake a piece of research to identify and understand barriers affecting recruitment. Whilst the research focused on barriers to members of the Catholic community joining the Police Service of Northern Ireland it also looked at a range of other factors including gender, age, socio-economic background and nationality.

“As a result of the findings, we are now making a number of changes to the recruitment process; these include redesigning the Join PSNI website, reducing the timescales for anyone applying and introducing an online initial selection test.

“This research has been shared with the Northern Ireland Policing Board and the Police Federation ensuring we can collectively make every effort to attract a diverse range of applicants from all sectors of our community.

“We intend to launch a new recruitment campaign in the Autumn.”
