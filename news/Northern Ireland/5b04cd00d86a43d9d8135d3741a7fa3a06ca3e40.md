Cannabis worth £200,000 seized

Officers from the PSNI’s Reactive and Organised Crime Branch carried out two house searches today, Tuesday 13 September, in connection with two previous cannabis seizures worth £200,000.

The first seizure occurred on Thursday 25 August when a package was recovered from the postal system. The value of this seizure is estimated to be about £80,000. The second seizure on Wednesday 31 August, also from the postal system, was a package containing herbal cannabis with a value of £120,000.

Detective Sergeant McAuley said: “The two house searches today were carried out in the East Belfast and Comber areas. Nothing was seized in East Belfast but several items were seized in Comber and have been taken for further examination.

“We are delighted to have taken these substantial quantities of cannabis out of circulation and our enquiries into these seizures are continuing. I would ask anyone who knows anything about the illegal use or supply of drugs to contact their local police station on the non-emergency number 101. Or if someone would prefer to provide information without giving their details, they can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800 555 111.”
