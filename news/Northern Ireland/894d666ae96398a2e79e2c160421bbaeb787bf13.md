Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said: "I am pleased that today has passed without major incident.

I would like to thank and acknowledge the hard work of the organisers of many of today's events and those within local communities who contributed to this largely successful day.

"I would also like to thank my officers and staff who have worked tirelessly and will continue to do so throughout the night to keep our communities safe.

"I would ask everyone, particularly those with influence, to continue to work with us to ensure that the rest of this holiday period can be enjoyed in peace and safety."
