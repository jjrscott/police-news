Six people have been arrested by detectives investigating an ATM burglary in County Fermanagh.

Several thousand pounds was taken from an ATM inside a shop in Trory on the outskirts of Enniskillen on Thursday 2 August.

Detective Inspector Trevor Stevenson said: “The burglary was reported to us at around 11am yesterday but is believed to have occurred between 1.30am and 5.30am.

We believe the perpetrators cut the street lighting and alarm wires prior to forcing entry to the shop and were then on site for a number of hours.

The suspects, a woman and five men all aged between 22 and 51, were detained during a proactive police operation in the Crossgar area last night. They remain in custody at present, assisting us with our enquiries.

I am appealing for anyone with information that could help our investigation to please get in touch with us. I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have been travelling on the Irvinestown Road between 1.30 and 5.30am on Thursday 2 August. Please call 101, quoting reference number 1165 02/08/18.”
