* Armagh City, Banbridge & Craigavon

Detectives are appealing for information following a pipe bomb attack at a house in the Burnside area of Craigavon.

Detective Sergeant Patterson said: "At around 12:50am this morning, Thursday 7 March, it was reported that a device had been pushed through a letterbox and had detonated inside the house.

Damage was caused to both the front door and hallway of the property.

A female resident aged in her 60s was upstairs in the property when the attack occurred. She was treated at the scene for shock but was not physically injured.

Enquiries are continuing and we would appeal to anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area to contact detectives on 101, quoting reference number 19 of 7/3/19.

Alternatively, information can be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime."
