Burglaries, Antrim & Newtownabbey Areas

Detectives are appealing for information following two burglaries that have occurred in the Antrim and Ballyclare areas.

A house in the Meadow Lands area of Antrim was burgled sometime between 3pm and 11.30pm on Thursday 10 March. A quantity of jewellery and cash was taken.

Cash and jewellery were also taken in a burglary of a house in the Beechview area of Ballyclare which occurred sometime between 4pm on Thursday and 12.10am on Friday morning.

Detective Inspector Chris Millar said: “At this time we are investigating a link between these burglaries. We are also investigating an attempted burglary in the Meadow Drive area of Antrim which occurred at about 9.30pm on Thursday evening, where a man was disturbed in the garden of a house and made off on foot.

“I would ask anyone with any information about these incidents, or anyone who noticed any suspicious activity in the areas, to contact detectives at Antrim Police Station on the non-emergency number 101. Or if someone would prefer to provide information without giving their details, they can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800 555 111.”
