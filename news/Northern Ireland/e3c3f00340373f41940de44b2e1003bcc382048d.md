Detectives are appealing for witnesses following the report of a hit-and-run road traffic collision on the Springfield Road in west Belfast during the early hours of this morning (Sunday, 19th May).

"Police attended the scene, along with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service. The man was taken to hospital for treatment of a neck injury.
