The Police Service of Northern Ireland welcomes the overall 'good' grading awarded by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) in the 'PEEL: Police efficiency and effectiveness' inspection, undertaken in June 2018.

Chief Constable George Hamilton said: "We welcome the overall 'good' grading awarded by HMICFRS in the 'Police efficiency and effectiveness inspection'. The inspection has shown that we are using our resources well to keep people safe and reduce crime. HMICFRS have also found that we are developing sound plans to address forthcoming challenges in spite of ongoing budgetary challenges. Finally, we welcome the report's conclusion that PSNI have improved the way we protect vulnerable victims in society. All of this is evidence of the considerable effort that has gone into improving our service to the people of Northern Ireland over recent years."
