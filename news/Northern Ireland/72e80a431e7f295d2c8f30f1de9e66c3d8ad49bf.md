Gun found, Ballycolman Estate, Strabane

Police have recovered a suspected firearm near the community centre in the Ballycolman Estate area of Strabane.

It was discovered behind a row of bushes in the area this morning, Wednesday 20th July, and has been taken away by officers from the PSNI's Serious Crime Branch for examination.

Detective Inspector Andy Workman said: "It is reckless in the extreme to leave such an item in an area near to a community centre which is frequented by all members of the community, including children.

"Thankfully this danger has now been removed and I would appeal to anyone in the area who knows anything about the circumstances in which this item came to be there, or who has any information about criminal activity in the area in general to contact police on 101.

"Alternatively, information can also be given anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."

Inspector Workman continued: “ In a separate incident in Strabane, a number of suspicious objects have been removed from open land at Spout Road by detectives from PSNI Serious Crime Branch following a search in the area. The objects have been taken for further forensic examination.”
