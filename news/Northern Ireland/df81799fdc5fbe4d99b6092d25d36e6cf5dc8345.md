PSNI to make Crimewatch appeal for information about the murder of Jim Donegan

A senior PSNI detective will make an appeal on BBC's Crimewatch Roadshow Live programme tomorrow, Thursday 21 March, in relation to the murder of Jim Donegan on the Glen Road in West Belfast on 4 December last year. The programme will air at 9.15am on BBC 1.

43 year old Jim Donegan was murdered as he sat in his car outside a school on the Glen Road in West Belfast, waiting to pick up his 13 year old son. The cold blooded execution was carried out by a lone gunman in front of hundreds of innocent school children and their parents.

Detective Chief Inspector Peter Montgomery from PSNI's Major Investigation Team said: "I have made a number of appeals to the public for information, issued CCTV footage and an evofit of the suspect since the lone gunman shot Mr Donegan just as hundreds of children were pouring out of the three schools - many of them witnessing the murder of the 43 year old father of two. Jim's son was spared from this thankfully but only by a few seconds. I would continue to urge anyone who has any information, or who witnessed the murder, to contact the police on 101.

"Or if someone would prefer to provide information without giving their details, they can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800 555 111."
