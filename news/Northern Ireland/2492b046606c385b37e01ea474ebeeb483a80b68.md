Detectives seized suspected cocaine with an estimated street value in the region of Â£18,000 and arrested a 45 year old woman in Ballynahinch early this morning, Thursday 20 June.

Detective Sergeant Johnston said: "Acting on information provided by colleagues in An Garda Siochana who had detained a number of individuals and seized a large quantity of herbal cannabis in Dublin, PSNI officers carried out a search under the Misuse of Drugs Act at an address in Riverside Meadows shortly after midnight.

A quantity of suspected class A drugs were discovered and will now be sent for closer forensic examination.

The arrested female remains in PSNI custody this afternoon.

Operations like this one demonstrates the efficacy of cross-border co-operation between PSNI and An Garda Siochana and how such close liaison between the agencies of the Joint Agency Taskforce can help law enforcement in both jurisdictions identify criminality, make arrests and ultimately place individuals before the courts."

The cross jurisdictional Joint Agency Task Force (JATF) was established under the Fresh Start Agreement.

The Task Force comprises the Police Service of Northern Ireland, An Garda Siochana, HM Revenue & Customs, the Revenue Commissioners, The Home Office Immigration Enforcement, the Criminal Assets Bureau, and the National Crime Agency. The JATF sees cross border cooperation across a range of policing areas and is of significant benefit to keeping our communities safe and secure, as well as continuing joint activity on issues which affect our communities such as rural policing and intelligence sharing.
