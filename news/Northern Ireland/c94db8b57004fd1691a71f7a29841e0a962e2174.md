* Derry City & Strabane

Detectives investigating an incident in Ballynagard Crescent, Derry/Londonderry earlier this week have this morning, Sunday 30 September, arrested three men.

Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said: “A disturbance is believed to have taken place at a property in the area at around 7.30pm on Thursday night, 27 September. This reportedly culminated in a vehicle being driven repeatedly at the front of the house, causing some damage to the gates and the building itself.

Our enquiries to date would also suggest that at some point during the fracas, a crossbow may have been fired at the car.

The arrested males, aged 33, 34 and 39 have been detained on suspicion of a range of offences and remain in custody this morning assisting us with our enquiries.”
