Detectives in Newry have welcomed the sentencing of 26 year old Robert Tasker and 25 year old Antoin McCooey at Newry Crown Court today ( Monday 18th June ), both men having been found guilty by a jury, of robbery, kidnapping, threats to kill and assault, earlier this year.

McCooey was sentenced to a total of 6 years imprisonment of which 3 years will be spent in custody and 3 on licence. Tasker was sentenced to 5 years, with a further 2 years imprisonment in relation to drugs offences to run consecutively, and will serve 3 ½ years in custody and 3 ½ years on licence.

Detective Chief Inspector Will Tate said: “The offences were committed in the early hours of Tuesday 29th November 2016, whilst Tasker and McCooey were travelling in a taxi from Dundalk to Cullyhanna. A short time into the journey, Tasker and McCooey produced a knife and a screwdriver which were then used to threaten the driver for the remainder of the journey.”

“This was a thoroughly traumatic incident for a man who was simply out doing his job, and I believe the sentence imposed at court today reflects the seriousness and gravity of the incident which has had a lasting impact on the taxi driver and his family.”

“The successful conclusion to this investigation is due to the very positive collaborative working relationship between PSNI detectives in Newry and An Garda Siochana detectives in Dundalk, and the dedication shown by both teams.”
