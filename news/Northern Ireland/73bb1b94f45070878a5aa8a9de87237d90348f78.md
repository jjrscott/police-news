Police investigating the fatal collision which occurred on the Moneynick Road, Toome on Sunday (March 17), have renewed their appeal for information.

Inspector Julian Buchanan said: "We received a report at 8.20pm that a pedestrian had been struck by a car close to a service station on Sunday evening.

"Tragically, 28 year old Diarmuid McFall died as a result of his injuries.

"We are appealing for witnesses and information and want to hear from anyone who may have been travelling on the road approximately 8.00 pm and 8.30pm and witnessed the incident.

"Also, if you were driving in the area you may have dash cam footage and, if you do, I would urge you to contact us on 101 quoting reference number 1296 of 17/03/19."
