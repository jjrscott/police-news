Police in north Belfast attended the scene of a security alert at an apartment block at Northview on the Antrim Road on Thursday 5th July.

Police were called to the scene after the discovery of a suspicious object in the area at around 10.30am on Thursday morning. ATO attended and a number of residents were evacuated from their properties for a number of hours whilst the object was examined. It has since been declared a viable pipe bomb type device and has been taken away for further forensic examination. All residents have now been permitted back to their homes.

Inspector Robert McMurran has appealed to anyone who noticed any suspicious activity in the area recently or anyone with any information which could assist with police enquiries to contact officers at Antrim Road on 101 quoting reference number 432 05/07/18. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.
