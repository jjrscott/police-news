A specialist police search and rescue team, who were continuing to search a storm drain complex, recovered the body of a young male in the North Belfast area just before 9.45am today (27 June).

Superintendent Muir Clark said, "While we have no official identification, we believe it is the missing teenager Noah Donohoe.

"Our thoughts and sympathies are with Noah's family and we are continuing to provide support to them at this very difficult and heat-breaking time.

"It is disappointing that I again need to comment about people circulating a number rumours about Noah's disappearance which are completely without foundation. This type of commentary and rumour is distressing for Noah's family and unhelpful.

"An investigation into the circumstances of Noah's disappearance is continuing, but there is no evidence to suggest foul play.

"Again, I would like to thank everyone who helped conduct and participate in the searches to find Noah.

"I also want to thank everyone who contacted police with information."
