Detectives from PSNI Serious Crime Branch investigating the murder of Inga Maria Hauser 30 years ago have arrested two men on suspicion of her murder.

The two men, aged 58 and 61, were arrested in the Loughguile area of County Antrim early this morning, Monday 21 May, and are currently being interviewed by detectives.

Detective Chief Superintendent Raymond Murray renewed his appeal for information in relation to the killing.

He said: “If there are any witnesses still out there with any further information which might help police then I would ask them to come forward now and speak to detectives.

“Even if there are people who know what happened but have stayed silent out of friendship or family loyalty, it is still not too late to come forward and tell us what you know.

“Failure to do so can be a criminal offence in itself and surely it would be better to come to police and discuss what happened rather than take the risk we will come to you.

“If you have information call 101 and ask to speak to Serious Crime Branch detectives in Maydown.”
