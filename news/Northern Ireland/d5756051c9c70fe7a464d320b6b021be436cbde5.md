* Fermanagh & Omagh

Police are investigating a security alert in the Wattlebridge Road area of Newtownbutler.

In response to claims from violent Dissident Republicans that shots were fired at a police helicopter on Thursday, 14th January, during these searches, Fermanagh and Omagh District Commander Superintendent Alywin Barton said: "I can confirm that no police aircraft, deployed in the area, was required to take evasive action and that, to date, we have received no reports of shots being heard or fired in the area. I can also confirm that no police aircraft sustained any damage.

"If there is any truth to this claim then the criminals behind it have shown nothing but a reckless disregard for the community in Fermanagh. I unequivocally condemn the actions of those who attempt to damage our communities with their criminal actions and claims and seek to disrupt policing and the daily lives of law abiding citizens.

"We have been working closely with the local community during our investigation and our enquiries will continue.

"I continue to appeal to members of the public living in, or travelling through the area to be vigilant, do not touch any suspicious objects and report any suspicious activity or object to us immediately on 999."
