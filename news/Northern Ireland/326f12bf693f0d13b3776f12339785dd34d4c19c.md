* Belfast

Detectives investigating an incident during which a man was shot twice at a house in the O'Neill's Lane area of west Belfast last night are issuing a fresh appeal for witnesses.

The victim, who is in his 50's sustained gunshot wounds to his leg after shots were fired at him through his front door in a paramilitary style attack at around 8.50pm.

Two suspects, dressed in dark coloured tracksuit, were seen leaving the area on foot in the direction of Brittons Parade following the shooting.

Detective Inspector Adam Ruston said: "This was a brutal attack carried out in a residential area where families with children and other residents were going about their normal evening routines unaware a dangerous firearm was about to be fired in their midst. Groups involved in attacks like this offer nothing to society. They do not represent the interests of the local community and seek only to exert control over communities through fear and violence.

I would appeal to anyone with information or who saw the two males at or near O'Neill's Lane to contact detectives at Musgrave on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111."
