Security alert: Wattlebridge Road, Newtownbutler

A suspicious object that prompted a security alert in the Wattlebridge Road in Newtownbutler was found to be an elaborate hoax.

The Wattlebridge Road and Cavan Road were closed for a period on Saturday, 28 May, while police and ATO examined the item which had been placed outside a local Orange Hall.

Chief Superintendent Pauline Shields thanked local people and road users for their patience and cooperation throughoutthe duration of the security alert.
