Detectives are appealing for information following the report of a robbery at commercial premises at a shopping complex at Victoria Street, Belfast on Wednesday 14th June.

At approximately 11.00am it was reported to police that an unknown male, armed with a knife, entered the premises and demanded that staff hand over money.

The suspect then left the premises with a sum of money. It is believed that he made off on foot in the direction of Rosses Court. He was described as wearing dark clothing and a baseball cap.

Detective Sergeant Kelly would appeal to anyone who may have noticed this male acting suspiciously or any business premises that may have CCTV footage which may help the police investigation, to contact detectives at Reactive and Organised Crime at Musgrave PSNI Station on the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 393 14/06/17. Alternatively, if someone would prefer to provide information without giving their details they can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800 555 111.
