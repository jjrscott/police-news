* Belfast

Detectives from the PSNI’s Terrorism Investigation Unit (TIU) have released images of the suspected firearms they seized yesterday following a search in the Lagmore area of West Belfast by the Belfast District Support Team.

The three suspected handguns have been taken away for further examination.

The four people who were arrested on suspicion of possessing firearms following the discovery - two women, aged 24 and 55, and two men, aged 55 and 20 - have been released on bail pending further enquires. The 20-year-old man is to be reported to the Public Prosecution Service for Possession of a Class B controlled drug.

Detective Inspector Andrew Hamlin from TIU said: “The seizure of these suspected firearms demonstrates our commitment to removing harm from our community and I would encourage anyone with information regarding criminality to contact police on 101. Alternatively, information can be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.”
