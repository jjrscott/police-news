Detectives are investigating the report of a serious assault on a man during the early hours of today (Friday 19th February) in east Belfast.

Police received a report at around 12:15am that the victim was set upon by three males, stabbed several times in the back and beaten around the head in an alleyway in the vicinity of Clandeboye Street and Epworth Street. Police and NIAS attended the scene and the victim, aged in his forties, was taken to hospital for treatment of his injuries.

One suspect is described as being approximately 35 years of age, while the other two are thought to be aged around 16 years old. All three suspects wore tops with hoods that were pulled up, and wore scarves covering part of their faces.

Detective Sergeant Dave Verner said: "This was a nasty and vicious attack on the victim who has sustained injuries to his back and his head.

"Enquiries to establish exactly what occurred and why are underway and I want to appeal to anyone who was in the area, shortly after midnight and witnessed the attack, or who saw any suspicious activity, to call our detectives at Musgrave on 101, quoting reference number 22 of 19/02/21."
