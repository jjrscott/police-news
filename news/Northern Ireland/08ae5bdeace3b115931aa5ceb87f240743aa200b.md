Police are appealing for witnesses to a road traffic collision in Portstewart yesterday (Saturday, 7th March).

Inspector Mullan said: "The collision involving a female cyclist and a blue Volkswagen Golf occurred on the Cromore Road at the junction with Roselick Road, and was reported to us just before 4pm.

"The cyclist was taken to hospital for treatment of her injuries, and where she remains today.

"I am appealing to anyone who was on the Cromore Road, at the junction with Roselick Road, at the time of the collision, and saw what happened, or captured the collision on their dash cam, to get in touch with us on 101, quoting reference number 1166 of 07/03/20."

The Cromore Road was closed for a time, but it has since re-opened.
