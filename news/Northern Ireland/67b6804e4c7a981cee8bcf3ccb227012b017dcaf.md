Police have arrested two people on suspicion of drugs offences.

On Friday, 8 April, following a road traffic collision in the Springfield Road area of Belfast police arrested a 34 year man on suspicion of drugs offences following the discovery of an amount of suspected cutting agent.

Following a follow-up search at a house in the Edenderry area of Belfast police arrested a 27 year old woman also on suspicion of drugs offences following the discovery of a quantity of suspected cocaine worth an estimated street value of £60,000. An amount of suspected cutting agent was also recovered at the house.

Detective Inspector Joanne Harris said: The man and woman are currently assisting police with their enquiries. I would like to take this opportunity to remind the community to report any information in relation to drugs in their area to their local police station on the non-emergency number 101. Or if someone would prefer to provide information without giving their details, they can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800 555 111.”
