A 27 year old man has been arrested following the report of an aggravated burglary at a house in south Belfast on Monday evening.

Detective Sergeant Eric Fairfield said: "It was reported to police at around 7.30 pm, that two occupants returned to the property in the Wolseley Street area, to find an unknown male inside armed with a knife.

"The man then fled from the scene, dropping the knife. Car keys, a wallet and an Amazon Echo device were reported to have been taken during the incident.

The man proceeded to smash a glass bottle on the police vehicle before making off. He was located in the Gas Works area on the roof of an abandoned building where he was arrested.
