Two men arrested on suspicion of drugs trafficking and money laundering, Belfast

Officers from the PSNI Reactive and Organised Crime Branch have arrested two men aged 37yrs and 41yrs on suspicion of drugs trafficking and money laundering offences in West Belfast.

The men were arrested following the seizure of herbal cannabis with an estimated street value of £150,000 in Belfast. Approximately £15,000 cash was also found during a search of the house where the men were detained.

Detective Sergeant Denis McGaffin said “Our investigation is at an early stage. We continue our efforts to keep people safe by removing drugs from the streets and arresting anyone suspected of involvement in their supply”.
