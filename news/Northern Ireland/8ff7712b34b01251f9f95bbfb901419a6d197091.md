Woman (71) robbed on Comber Greenway - Belfast

Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman in her seventies was robbed on the Comber Greenway earlier today.

Sergeant Rodney Patton explains: “At around 12.45 this afternoon the woman, who was walking using a zimmer frame, was approached by a male on the greenway close to Barnett’s Road/Kings Road.

The male, who was wearing a dark hoody, pulled the woman’s handbag from her, knocking her to the ground.

He then ran off in the direction of Knock Road.

The victim wasn’t badly hurt but was left understandably very shaken by the ordeal.”

Police are keen to hear from witnesses and those who were on the greenway or were travelling on Barnett’s Road or Kings Road between 12.45pm and 1pm.

Officers can be contacted at Strandtown police station by calling 101.
