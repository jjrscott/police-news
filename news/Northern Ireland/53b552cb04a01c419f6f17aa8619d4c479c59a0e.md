* Belfast

Detectives are appealing for information following an aggravated burglary in Summerhill Court, north Belfast yesterday afternoon, Friday 1 March.

Detective Sergeant Gill said: "Shortly before 12:30pm, it was reported that two men, one of whom was armed with a suspected firearm, entered a house in the area. Two females who were inside the property were threatened but were not injured. It is not believed that anything was taken during the incident and enquiries are continuing.

"We would appeal to anyone who witnessed anything suspicious in the area to contact detectives on 101, quoting reference number 589 2/3/19. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime."
