Four males charged with burglary offences - Banbridge

Four males aged 16, 17, 18 and 19 have been charged with a number of counts of burglary and are expected to appear at Banbridge Magistrates court this morning.

As is usual procedure the charges will be reviewed by the PPS.

The males were arrested in Banbridge on Tuesday following reports of suspicious activity and a number of subsequently reported burglaries in the Dromore Road and Laurel Heights areas.
