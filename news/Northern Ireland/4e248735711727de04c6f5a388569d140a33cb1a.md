Man sustains multiple fractures in assault - Larne

Detectives are investigating a serious assault at a house in the Hampton Crescent area of Larne.

A 25 year old man sustained fractures to his arm and leg after he was set upon by five masked men armed with baseball bats and bars at around 00.35am this morning.

The victim is currently recovering in hospital.

Chief Inspector Stephen McCauley has appealed for anyone with information to contact detectives in Reactive and Organised Crime on the non-emergency number 101.

If someone would prefer to provide information about this crime without giving their name, they can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

A number of other people who were in the home at the time were not hurt.
