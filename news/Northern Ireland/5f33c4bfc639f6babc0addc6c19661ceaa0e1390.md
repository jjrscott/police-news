A 41 year old man has been sentenced today for an attack on Coalisland Police Station in 1997.

Paul Campbell (41 years) was sentenced to seven and half years custody at Belfast Crown Court today, Wednesday, 26 February for causing an explosion at Coalisland Police Station.

Detective Chief Inspector John Caldwell said: `"Today's sentencing is the result of a long and complex investigation by officers from PSNI's Serious Crime Branch into an explosive device that was thrown at Coalisland police station on 26 March 1997. It should send a clear message to those involved in violence - we will vigorously pursue those responsible to bring them before the courts to face the consequences of their actions.

Detective Chief Inspector Caldwell concluded: "We will continue to combat the threat posed by those who plan to use violence to further their agendas. We remain committed to making Northern Ireland safer for everyone."
