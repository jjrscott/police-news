Search of vehicle and arrests: Tully Road, Crumlin

Detectives from Reactive and Organised Crime Branch have arrested four men following the stop and search of a vehicle at Tully Road in Crumlin on Friday 10th June.

Detective Inspector Keith Gawley said: “ A Citroen Berlingo was stopped at around 2.45pm by officers who searched the vehicle and recovered a substantial sum of cash on board and a small amount of suspected cocaine. The four men travelling in the vehicle, aged 34, 36, 37 and 44 were all arrested on suspicion of possessing criminal property with the 37 year old man further arrested on suspicion of possession of a class A controlled drug. Follow up searches in the Belfast area uncovered a quantity of suspected cannabis resin valued at around £1000. The men remain in custody at this time.”

Inspector Gawley continued: “ I would appeal to anyone with information about any illegal activity to contact Police on 101 to assist us in our efforts to thwart those who seek to gain from their criminal activity.”
