Detectives from the Police Service of Northern Ireland's Terrorism Investigation Unit (TIU) can confirm that an item seized during planned searches in the Lord Lurgan Park, Lurgan yesterday (Sunday 23rd August), is in relation to an ongoing investigation into violent dissident republicanism. Amongst the items seized for forensic examination was a partially constructed, improvised heavy duty weapon.

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Rowland, of the Terrorist Investigation Unit, said: "Using a public park to store such items is irresponsible and demonstrates a complete disregard for the members of this community, including many families and young children who use this park for recreation. I want to appeal to anyone who has seen anyone acting suspiciously in the area of the park or in the local area, or has any information, to contact police on 101 or contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800 555 111."
