Police in west Belfast are investigating the circumstances surrounding a fire at a house at Glasvey Gardens in the early hours of Wednesday 19th July.

Detective Sergeant Keith Wilson said: “The fire was reported to police at around 2.45am on Wednesday morning and at this time it would appear that it started to the rear of the property and has spread to the house which has been left extensively damaged. The male occupant, who was rescued from the house by neighbours before the arrival of police did not report any injuries as a result of the incident, however, a police officer was treated by ambulance staff at the scene for smoke inhalation. A number of nearby homes were evacuated whilst NIFRS personnel extinguished the fire.”

“Our enquiries into the cause of the fire are continuing and I would appeal to anyone who noticed any suspicious activity in the Glasvey Gardens area to contact detectives at Musgrave on 101 quoting reference number 138 19/07/17 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.”
