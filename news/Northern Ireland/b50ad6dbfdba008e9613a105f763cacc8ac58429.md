At Laganside Crown Court today, Thursday, 30 January, 35 year old Marian Ilie was sentenced to 1 years imprisonment, suspended for two years for human trafficking and money laundering.

Detective Superintendent Richard Campbell, head of the Police Service of Northern Ireland's Specialist Investigations Unit, said: "Detectives from the PSNI's Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Unit, working closely with colleagues from PSNI's Cyber Crime Unit, arrested Marian Ilie as part of a proactive investigation into the trafficking of women into Northern Ireland for the purposes of sexual exploitation. He is the fourth person in Northern Ireland to be convicted under the new 2015 Human Trafficking legislation.

"This is the second PSNI operation leading to convictions which did not rely on any evidence having to be provided by the victims.

"Evidence secured by police identified Marian Ilie as being involved in the exploitation of these women and while he had a less prominent role in the trafficking operation, today's sentence demonstrates that no matter what part you play in exploitation and human trafficking, you will be brought to justice.

"I would urge anyone who may be aware of someone being exploited, to contact the Police Service of Northern Ireland on the non-emergency number 101. Alternatively, information can be provided anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime."
