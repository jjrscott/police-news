Man critical following stabbing - Dunmurry

A man is in a critical condition in hospital after a stabbing in west Belfast.

Inspector James Murphy said: “It appears the incident took place at a house in Vere Foster Walk at around 4am this morning.

It’s understood the victim, who is 51, was stabbed in the abdomen but was able to make his way to Springfield Close on foot before emergency services were contacted.

I would appeal to anyone with information to contact police on the non-emergency number 101. Or, if someone would prefer to provide information without giving their details they can contact the Crimestoppers charity anonymously on 0800 555 111.”
