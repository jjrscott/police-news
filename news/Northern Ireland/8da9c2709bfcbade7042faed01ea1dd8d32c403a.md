Castlederg drugs charges and Foyle arrest after Belgian cannabis seizures

A 40 year old man is due to appear at Strabane Magistrates Court this morning on charges linked to the seizure of £64,000 worth of cannabis in Belgium.

The herbal cannabis was seized in Belgium as part of a joint operation between the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the National Crime Agency.

Detective Inspector Tom McClure, from Reactive and Organised Crime Branch, said: “As a result of the seizure, detectives searched a house in Castlederg yesterday and arrested a 40 year old man. He will appear in court on four charges, including attempted importation of a class B drug and attempted possession with intent to supply of a class B drug. Anyone involved in the importation and supply of illegal drugs can expect to be pursued by police and brought before the courts.”

In a follow-up operation, police arrested a 40 year old man in the Carnhill area of Londonderry today after herbal cannabis with a potential street value of £66,000 was also uncovered in Belgium. Detective Inspector Tom McClure, from Reactive and Organised Crime Branch, said: “Our enquiries with the National Crime Agency are continuing. A property was searched in Carnhill by PSNI detectives and the suspect is being questioned at Strand Road police station in relation to a number of offences including the attempted importation of class B drugs.”

This brings the total amount of drugs uncovered in the two seizures in Belgium to £130,000.
