* Belfast

Two people have been charged with a number of offences following the seizure of a substantial quantity of cannabis during a proactive police operation in south Belfast earlier this week.

Detectives from PSNI’s Organised Crime Branch seized more than £1m worth of the illegal class B drug and arrested a 37 year old woman in Stranmillis and a 48 year old man in the Lisburn Road area on Thursday, 9 August.

Speaking immediately after the operation Detective Inspector Pete Mullan said: “These arrests and seizures are evidence of our ongoing commitment to disrupting the illegal supply of drugs in Northern Ireland. We are glad to have prevented these drugs reaching the streets and to essentially have taken £1million from the hands of organised criminals who profit from the misery of others."

The 37 year old woman and 48 year old man are due to appear at Belfast magistrates court this morning to face charges including possessing class B drugs, possessing class B drugs with intent to supply, conspiracy to supply class B drugs and possession of a false identity.

As is usual procedure the charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS).
