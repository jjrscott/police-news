Police are appealing for information following the report of criminal damage in the Whinpark Road area of Newtownards on Monday night (August 5th).

Sergeant McCrorry said: "It was reported at around 10:40 pm that windows of a car parked outside a house in the Whinpark Road area, were smashed by a group of masked people with what is believed to have been a baton.

"A window at the property was also damaged during the incident.

"We are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or may have seen a group of masked people in the area around the time to contact police in Newtownards on 101 quoting reference number 2562 of 05/08/19."

Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.
