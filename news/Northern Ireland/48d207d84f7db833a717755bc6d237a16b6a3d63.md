Arrest in investigation into £30k cannabis seizure, North Belfast

A 47 year old man has been arrested by officers from the PSNI Reactive and Organised Crime Branch on suspicion of conspiracy to supply cannabis and importing cannabis.

The arrest relates to the seizure of herbal cannabis with an estimated street value of £30,000 on 8 March in the Skegoneill area of north Belfast. The man is currently helping police with their enquiries.

Detective Sergeant Denis McGaffin said, “We will continue to pursue anyone suspected of involvement in the supply of controlled drugs. The passage of time does not hinder our efforts or determination to investigate crimes of this nature. If the evidence exists, we will find it and use it to ensure suspects are brought before the Courts”.

At this time two men have been charged in connection to the investigation.
