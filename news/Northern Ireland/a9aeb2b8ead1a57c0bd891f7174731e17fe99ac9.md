* Belfast

Officers from the Belfast District support Team, assisted by officers from Tennent Street Local Policing Team have seized thousands of suspected diazepam, suspected pregablin tablets and suspected cocaine with estimated street value of £30,000 during proactive searches on Wednesday afternoon, October 21st.

Following a proactive road stop in the York Street area conducted by officers shortly before 4 pm, a 37 year old man was arrested on suspicion of a number of drug and motoring offences.

A follow up search of a property in the north Belfast was carried out and a large amount of tablets suspected cocaine was seized along with over £5,000 cash. The man was released on bail pending further enquiries.

Sergeant Connolly said: "Those involved in drugs criminality seek to line their own pockets at the expense of causing harm to others. They set out to ruin the communities that they live and operate in and they do not care about the damage that they cause.

"I would encourage anyone who has any information about the use or supply of illegal drugs to contact police on the non-emergency number 101 with any information they have. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime."
