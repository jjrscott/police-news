Aggravated burglary, Circular Road, Dungannon

Detectives from Reactive and Organised Crime Branch are investigating an aggravated burglary in the Circular Road area of Dungannon last night, Friday, 22 July.

At approximately 10.00pm it was reported that two men, one of whom was armed with what is believed to be a gun, forced their way into a house.

Detective Inspector Will Tate said: “It is believed the pair threatened the occupants of the house, a man and a woman, before fleeing with a sum of money and jewellery.

“The man and woman were left very badly shaken.

“I am appealing to anyone who may have noticed any suspicious activity in the area to contact Detectives at Cookstown on the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference number 1441 22/07/16. Alternatively, if someone would prefer to provide information without giving their details they can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800 555 111.”
