Police seized a quantity of suspected Class B controlled drugs and Â£10,000 in cash, following searches in Armagh yesterday, Thursday, 29 October.

Officers from the Armagh Neighbourhood Policing Team, supported by colleagues from our Tactical Support Group and Dog Section conducted the pre-planned searches at two addresses in the west of Armagh city. As well as suspected drugs and cash police also seized two cars, with one car believed to have been involved in dangerous driving and diffing (anti-social behaviour by car), two suspected firearms, a large quantity of fireworks and suspected illegal fuel.

A 32 year-old man was arrested on suspicion of several offences including possession of firearms in suspicious circumstances, possession of a firearm and ammunition without a certificate, and possession of Class A and Class B drugs. He remains in police custody at this time.
