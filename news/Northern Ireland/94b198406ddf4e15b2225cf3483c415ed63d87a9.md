* Belfast

Detectives in Lisburn are appealing for witnesses following a vehicle hijacking in the Bests Hill area of Belfast in the early hours of this morning, Saturday 30th December.

Detective Constable Ruth Gallagher said: “Between midnight and 00:15am, a male approached a white Vauxhall Corsa and opened the driver’s door. The male grabbed the driver by his arm, pulled him out of the car and subsequently drove off, out of the Bests Hill area.

The driver was not physically injured in the incident, however, he has been left shaken by his ordeal.

I would ask that anyone with information contact detectives in the Lisburn Criminal Investigation Branch on the non emergency number 101, quoting reference number 15 of 30/12/2017.

“Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.”
