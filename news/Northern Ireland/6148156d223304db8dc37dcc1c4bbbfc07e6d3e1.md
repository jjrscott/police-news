* Belfast

Police investigating reports of a disturbance at licensed premises on the Antrim Road in north Belfast at around 9.30pm on Sunday 8 July are appealing for witnesses.

Detective Inspector Stephen Harvey said: “Tragically, a 26-year-old man who was arrested following this incident, died later following medical treatment while in custody at Musgrave Police Station in the early hours of Monday 9 July. As is normal procedure, the office of the Police Ombudsman has been informed of the matter and has begun an investigation. A post mortem examination will be carried out in due course to determine the cause of death.

“A police investigation into the circumstances surrounding the disturbance is underway. I am appealing for anyone with any information which could assist detectives with our enquiries or anyone who has mobile phone or dashcam footage of the incident, to contact us at Musgrave Police Station on 101 quoting reference number 1561 of 8/7/18.

“Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

“As PONI are investigating, it would be inappropriate to comment any further.”
