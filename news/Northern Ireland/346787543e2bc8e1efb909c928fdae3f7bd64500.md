Arson attack - Richhill

Police are investigating an early morning arson attack in Richhill, county Armagh.

Detective Constable Colin Robinson said: “At around 5.40am we received a report that a vehicle had been set alight in Elm Park. The car appeared to have been deliberately pushed up against a house which then also caught fire.

The residents, two men aged 65 and 30 and a 65 year old woman, were able to exit the property safely. A number of nearby homes were evacuated by police as a precaution while the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service dealt with the blaze.

We are keen to hear from anyone with information about this crime or from anyone who may have been in the area at around 5.30am this morning . The number to call is 101.”
