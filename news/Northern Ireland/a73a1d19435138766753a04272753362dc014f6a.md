Man charged with drugs offences, Coleraine

Police have charged a 40 year-old man with a number of drugs-related offences following the discovery of a cannabis factory in Coleraine yesterday, Monday 4th July.

Approximately £40,000 of herbal cannabis was discovered by officers during a search of premises in the Railway Road area shortly after 5pm.

The man, who was arrested at the scene, was charged with cultivating cannabis, possession of a class B controlled drug with intent to supply and possession of a class B controlled drug. He has been released on bail to appear at Coleraine Magistrates Court on Monday 1st August.

Sgt Stephen Burns, of Coleraine Local Policing Team, said: “This seizure came about as the result of excellent police work by local officers following up on a strong smell of cannabis coming from the premises.

“This is an ongoing example of how the PSNI is keeping people safe while policing in the community. The officers involved are to be commended for their actions, which have taken a substantial amount of drugs out of circulation and reduced the harm they cause to communities.

“If you have any suspicions regarding strange smells or suspicious activity, please call the PSNI on 101, or you can report the matter anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
