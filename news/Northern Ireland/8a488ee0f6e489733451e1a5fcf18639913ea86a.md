Following the Annual Cross Border Conference today, which was held virtually, the Police Service of Northern Ireland Chief Constable Simon Byrne said:

"The cooperation that already exists between the Police Service of Northern Ireland and An Garda Siochana, and other law enforcement partners, is excellent.

"Whilst there is still uncertainty about what the new year will bring in terms of EU Exit and the impact of the global pandemic on all our lives, I can say with absolute certainty that our shared approach to tackling organised criminality on both sides of the border will continue unreservedly.

"Today's conference presents an excellent opportunity for members of the Cross Border Joint Agency Task Force to come together to consider how best to meet the challenges of the year ahead."

The latest Cross Border Joint Agency Task Force Report was published today.
