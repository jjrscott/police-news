Detectives from the PSNI's Criminal Investigation Branch investigating the horrific abduction and attack on Mr Kevin Lunney in Fermanagh in September are this morning conducting a number of searches in the Derrylin area of Fermanagh. They are part of a coordinated search operation with our colleagues in An Garda Siochana and Derbyshire Constabulary.

Detective Chief Inspector Julie Mullan said: "The investigation is continuing at pace and today's significant operation involves searching four residential properties and one commercial premises in the Derrylin area.

"Our colleagues in Derbyshire Constabulary are searching one premises in their area and members of An Garda Siochana are searching five locations in County Cavan, three locations in County Longford and four locations in Dublin. These premises are a mixture of domestic dwellings and commercial business premises.

Detective Chief Inspector Mullan continued; "This was a truly horrific crime and we continue to work closely with our colleagues in An Garda Siochana and now also Derbyshire Constabulary.to try and bring the perpetrators to justice." __ __
