Police are today releasing images of people they wish to speak with in relation to disorder at Distillery Street, Belfast on Saturday 8 August.

Superintendent Gillian Kearney said: "Today we are releasing nine images of individuals that we would like to talk to in connection with our ongoing investigations into disorder during which 29 police officers were injured.

"To date we have charged nine people in relation to this disorder and reported five people to the PPS. We are committed to identifying those involved and bring all offenders before the Courts. By releasing these further images I am hopeful that either the individuals themselves will contact police directly or the wider community can help us identify them.

"It is in everybody's interest - as well as in the interest of justice - that those responsible are dealt with appropriately and I would urge anyone who may have any information to bring it forward to Police at Musgrave police station by calling the non-emergency number 101. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, which is 100% anonymous."
