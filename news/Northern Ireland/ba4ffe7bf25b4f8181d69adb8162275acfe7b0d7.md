* Derry City & Strabane

Detectives investigating a house fire in Dungiven on Friday night (3rd January) are appealing for witnesses and information.

Detective Sergeant Wallace said: "The blaze at a house in Ard na Smoll was reported to us at approximately 11:40pm. Officers attended the scene, along with the NIFRS who brought the blaze under control and extinguished it.

"Thankfully, there were no reports of any injuries, however, significant damage has been caused to the property by what was a reckless and sinister act.

"The NIFRS has ruled this to be deliberate ignition, and so we are treating this as arson.

"We are working to establish the exact circumstances of what occurred and I want to appeal to anyone who saw any suspicious activity in Ard na Smoll on Friday night, around 11:30pm, including persons or vehicles, to get in touch with us.

"I would also urge anyone who has information which may help us identify who is responsible to call our detectives in Coleraine on 101, and quote reference number 2190 of 03/01/20."

Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime."
