* Armagh City, Banbridge & Craigavon

Police are appealing for information and witnesses following a fire in Lurgan during the early hours of this morning (Tuesday 2nd April).

Chief Inspector Jon Burrows said: "We received a report just before 1:15am that an outbuilding at the rear of a property in Orient Circle was on fire, and the blaze had spread to a nearby vacant property.

"The outbuilding was completely gutted while windows in the vacant property were smashed. There were no reports of any injuries.

"Police attended along with the NIFRS, who have ruled the blaze to be deliberate and so we are treating it as arson.

"An investigation is underway to establish the cause of the fire and I want to appeal to anyone who was in Orient Circle area just prior to when the fire was reported to us, or in the period afterwards and saw any suspicious activity to call us on the non emergency number 101, quoting reference number 50 of 02/04/19."

Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.
