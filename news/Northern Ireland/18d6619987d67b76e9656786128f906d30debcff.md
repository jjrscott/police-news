Detectives from PSNI's Public Protection Branch have welcomed the conviction of a 30 year old man from Lurgan for rape and two counts of sexual assault against a woman. He was sentenced to three years and nine months imprisonment earlier today, Tuesday 10 September, at Craigavon Crown Court. He will also be required to sign the sex offenders' register and will be subject to a Sexual Offences Prevention Order for five years.

Detective Inspector Leah Crothers said: "The young woman involved displayed immense courage in coming forward to police and I welcome the fact that this offender is now behind bars. I hope that the young woman's resolution to bring him to justice will encourage anyone else who has experienced any form of sexual abuse to come forward to police.

"Our officers in PSNI's Public Protection Branch are committed to investigating all reports of sexual assault and we seek to place offenders before the courts so they can be made amenable for their crimes. We have specially trained officers who will treat you with sensitivity and respect. I would continue to encourage anyone who has experienced any form of sexual assault to contact police on 101."
