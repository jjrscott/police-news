Two people were questioned by police following the discovery of a cannabis factory in Newtownbutler.

Officers carried out a proactive search at a house on the Wattlebridge Road yesterday, Monday 23 April.

Inspector Jonathan Gordon said: “A substantial cannabis factory containing plants worth more than £7,000 was found during the operation under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Two people, a 45 year old woman and a 34 year old man were detained at the property on suspicion of a range of drugs offences including cultivating cannabis and being concerned in the supply of a controlled drug.

The pair were subsequently released on bail pending further enquiries.

The plants have been seized by police along with cultivation equipment and other drugs paraphernalia.

I would continue to encourage members of the public with concerns or suspicions around drug cultivation or drug dealing to make local police aware. By working together we can strike a blow against those who would seek to bring drugs into our communities.”
