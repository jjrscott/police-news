* Belfast

Police investigating disorder in the New Lodge area of north Belfast earlier this week have arrested two teenage boys on suspicion of riotous behaviour.

The 14 year olds were detained by officers from the Oldpark Neighbourhood Policing Team this morning, Saturday 3 August, and have been taken to Musgrave police station.

Chief Inspector Kelly Moore said: "Residents in the New Lodge and nearby areas have endured serious disorder on their doorstep this week and local police officers came under sustained attack from young people throwing masonry and petrol bombs. We had pledged to review all the available evidence, including footage captured by police officers on the ground, in order to identify perpetrators. This morning's arrests are the result of this investigative work and as we progress our enquiries I would expect further arrests to follow in due course.

Thankfully last night saw no repeat of the violence of previous nights however we have assigned additional resources to the area and these will remain in place over coming days. We want to keep young people safe and ensure they don't get involved in illegal activity or are harmed in anyway however it is important that those engaged in violent behaviour on the streets, attacking police and their own community, understand that such actions have consequences."
