Detectives are investigating an aggravated burglary at the home of a man in his 80s in Portadown on Sunday 25 November.

The occupant was in his home on the Derrylettiff Road with his vulnerable daughter when three masked males entered the property at around 8.30pm.

The intruders tied the homeowners hands and removed a sim card from one mobile phone and breaking another before ransacking a number of rooms.

The trio subsequently made off with a sum of cash.

Detective Constable Joanne Jackson said: "This despicable crime has left an older man and his daughter extremely shaken and we are appealing to anyone with information to please get in touch with us. Witnesses can call 101, quoting reference 1226 25/11/18."
