Aggravated burglary, Finaghy Road North, Belfast

Detectives from Reactive and Organised Crime Branch are investigating an aggravated burglary at a parochial house on Finaghy Road North in Belfast on the evening of Friday, 22 July.

At around 7.50pm it was reported that two men, at least one of whom was armed with a gun, forced their way into St Michael the Archangel.

Detective Sergeant Michael Hawthorne said: "Our enquiries are at an early stage however at this time we believe the pair threatened a priest who was inside the property before fleeing with a sum of money and a set of keys.

"The priest has been left badly shaken by his ordeal and we are appealing for the public's help in identifying the perpetrators of this crime. Please call 101, quoting reference number 1236 22/07/16. Alternatively, if someone would prefer to provide information without giving their details they can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800 555 111."
