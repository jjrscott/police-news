Detectives from the PSNI's Major Investigation Team investigating the murder of 55 year old William (Pat) McCormick have recovered a body in the Ballygowan area.

Detective Chief Inspector Pete Montgomery, who is leading the investigation, said: "I can confirm that a man's body has been found in the Ballygowan area. I am unable to confirm the identity of the man until a formal identification process has taken place. A post mortem is also being conducted."

The father of four was last seen alive in Comber on the evening of Thursday 30 May and Crimestoppers has offered a Â£10,000 reward for information which leads to the recovery of his body.
