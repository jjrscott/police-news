Police are appealing for witnesses following a robbery at a filling station on the M1 (Southbound) this afternoon (Sunday, 23rd August).

Detective Sergeant Ricky Thompson said: "It was reported to police that two males entered the premises wearing scarves and baseball caps, one of them was believed to have been armed with possibly a knife or a screwdriver.

"They threatened members of staff and made off with two cash registers. They fled the scene in a black Ford Focus which is then reported to have crossed the border, where the vehicle was stopped by our colleagues in An Garda Siochana and two males aged 25 and 26 were subsequently arrested.

"Enquiries are continuing and we are appealing to anyone who witnessed anything suspicious in the area to contact detectives on 101, quoting reference number 1133 of 23/08/20."

Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.
