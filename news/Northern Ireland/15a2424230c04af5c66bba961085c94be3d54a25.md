A 40-year-old man from Antrim was sentenced at Laganside Crown Court earlier today, Tuesday 16 April, for child sex offences.

Alan McBride was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, half to be spent in custody and half on licence, after he pled guilty to meeting a 15 year old child following sexual grooming and causing or inciting child pornography in 2013. He will also be subject to a Sexual Offences Prevention Order for five years.

Detective Constable Hawthorne said: "Mr McBride manipulated the victim who was just a teenager at the time for his own sexual gain and he will now be locked up behind bars for his actions. The victim has shown courage in coming forward and telling us what happened.

"PSNI Public Protection Branch is committed to investigating all reports of sexual offences against children and young people. Today's conviction goes to show that we will pursue sex offenders and bring them before the courts so they can be made amenable for their crimes. We have specially trained officers who will treat all victims with sensitivity and respect."
