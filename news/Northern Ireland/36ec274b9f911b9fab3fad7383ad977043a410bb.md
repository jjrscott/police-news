UPDATE: Males arrested following unnotified parade: Kilwilkie, Lurgan

A 51 year old man has been charged with taking part in an unnotified public procession and is expected to appear at Craigavon Magistrates Court on 22 June 2016.

As is usual procedure the charge will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.

The male was one of twelve arrested yesterday, Saturday 28 May, following an unnotified parade in the Kilwilkie area of Lurgan.

Two of the arrested men were released unconditionally while the remaining nine were released on police bail to return at a later date.
