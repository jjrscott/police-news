* Belfast

A man is being questioned by detectives following a robbery in south Belfast last night, Friday 14 July.

Detective Sam McCallum said: “At around 10.45pm staff at a post office on Ormeau Road reported that a male brandishing a bottle had robbed the premises, fleeing with a sum of cash.

Responding officers conducted a search of the area and located a male matching the suspect’s description in University Street. This male ran from police but officers gave chase and he was subsequently detained in Lavinia Square.

The arrested man remains in custody this morning assisting us with our enquiries.

We are keen to hear from witnesses or anyone who was in the Ballynafeigh area of Ormeau Road last night and who may be able to assist the investigation. Detectives can be contacted at Musgrave Police Station by calling 101, quoting reference number 1386 14/07/17.”

Information about crime can also be passed anonymously to the Crimestoppers charity on 0800 555 111.
