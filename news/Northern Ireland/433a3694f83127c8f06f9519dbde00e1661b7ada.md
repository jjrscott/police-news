* Belfast

Detectives at Musgrave CID are investigating a burglary at a house in Sharman Close in Belfast overnight between Wednesday 4 November and Thursday 5 November.

It's believed entry was gained to the house sometime between 10pm and 10.30pm on Wednesday. A set of house keys may have been taken at this time and then later used to re-enter the house at around 00.10 on Thursday. The male occupant of the home disturbed the intruder(s) this time and they made off with the keys of two vehicles which were parked outside. The vehicles were not taken.

Anyone with information regarding this crime can contact police on 101, quoting reference 30 05/11/20.

Detectives are also urging local people to be vigilant against burglars s the darker evenings draw in, and to take extra care to keep homes and belongings safe. Close and lock all doors and windows, consider security lights. To a burglar, a dark house is an empty house.

If you have older relatives or neighbours help them to keep their property and belongings secure.

Advice and assistance with crime prevention can be obtained by visiting the PSNI website or by calling 101 and requesting a visit from your local Crime Prevention Officer.
