Detectives are investigating an armed robbery at a house in the Gardiners Cross Road area of Maguiresbridge on Friday 21st September.

A report was received by police shortly after 9pm that four masked men, armed with knives, had entered a house in the area and threatened the male occupant, before tying him up and making off with a sum of money and two mobile phones. The occupant was not physically injured but was left badly shaken following the incident.

Officers would ask anyone who noticed any suspicious activity in the area on Friday evening or who has any information which could assist them with their enquiries to contact detectives at Enniskillen on 101 quoting reference number 1345 21/09/18. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.
