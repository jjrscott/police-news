Eleven arrests linked to city St Patrick's Day festivities - Belfast

Police in Belfast made a total of eleven arrests in and around the city centre and Holyland areas yesterday, 17 March.

The arrests, linked to the St Patrick’s Day celebrations in the city, were for a range of public order offences including disorderly behaviour, resisting arrest and assault on police.

Belfast Commander Chief Superintendent Chris Noble said: “Thankfully there was no repeat of the disgraceful levels of violence and behaviour that we saw in the Holylands on Wednesday however there were numerous reports of anti-social, nuisance behaviour as well as sporadic instances of scuffles and fights among various groups of revellers, both in the ‘student areas’ and in the city centre.

A significant police operation was in place to help ensure the festivities passed off in a largely peaceful fashion and, with the exception of a few, most people who attended the city centre parade, or who celebrated independently, did so in a good natured and respectful fashion.

A clean-up operation will obviously take place today and, in due course, police along with partner agencies will review all of the planning for St Patrick’s Day and it’s associated events and will take away whatever learning there is to improve the experience in future for residents and visitors alike.”
