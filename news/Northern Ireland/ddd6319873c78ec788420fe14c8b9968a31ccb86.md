* Belfast

Detectives investigating a sexual assault in Belfast city centre during the early hours of this morning, Sunday 2 February, are making a specific appeal for a witness to come forward.

A 23 year old woman was assaulted by a male in the public toilet in Bankmore Square at around 2.15am. A 23 year old male suspect was arrested a short time later and remains in custody at present.

The victim of the assault was assisted immediately afterwards by a female, who it is believed called police using the victim's phone.

Detective Sergeant Nick Harris said: "We would like to hear from the individual who approached the young woman and assisted her. You may have information that could assist us.

The Dublin Road/Bankmore Square area would also have been busy at that time and I would also appeal to anyone who was in the area and who may have seen something that could help the investigation to please call 101, quoting reference 275 02/02/20."
