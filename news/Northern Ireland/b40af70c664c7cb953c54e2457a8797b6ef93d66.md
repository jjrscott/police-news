Commenting on the Twelfth celebrations, Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton said: "I am pleased that today has passed without major incident.

"I would like to thank and acknowledge the hard work of the organisers of events, community leaders, our partners and my officers and staff, who helped make this a safe and enjoyable day for many.

"We dealt with a number of minor incidents throughout the day and made a number of arrests but these did not detract from what was a peaceful day. We are aware of some alleged breaches of parade determinations and these will be investigated accordingly.

We will be continuing our duties throughout the night and weekend to keep communities safe."

There were 8 arrests in total during the policing operation for the Twelfth Parades. These are operational figures and subject to change
