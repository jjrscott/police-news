Two men aged 29 and 30 have been charged with a range of drugs offences following the discovery of a cannabis factory in Portadown on Friday, 21 February.

The pair were arrested after cannabis plants with an estimated value of around Â£55,000 were found by police at a house in Broomhill following concerns from a member of the public.

Both men are expected to appear at Lisburn Magistrates court tomorrow, Monday 24 February.

As is usual procedure the charges will be reviewed by the PPS.
