Detectives are appealing for witnesses following the report of a disturbance in Dungannon town centre last night (Saturday 13th June).

At approximately 7:40pm it was reported that a large group of males were fighting in the vicinity of Thomas Street.

Police responded and found a male injured in the Union Place area with facial injuries.

A second male was also discovered by police in the Thomas Street area. He had sustained serious injuries to his head and face and was taken to hospital by police for treatment of his injuries.

A 32-year-old man has since been arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and common assault, and he remains in custody at this time.

Detective Sergeant Brian Reid said: "Our investigation to establish exactly what occurred last night continues and I would appeal to anyone who may have been in the area and saw what happened, or captured footage of what occurred, to get in touch with us.

"We are also investigating the report of an assault on a male in the area who suffered a hand injury, which is reported to have occurred in the area around 7pm yesterday and which may be linked.
