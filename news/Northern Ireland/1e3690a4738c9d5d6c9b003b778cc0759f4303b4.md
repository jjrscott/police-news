Householder robbed - Loughgall

Detectives are appealing for witnesses following a robbery in the Tirmacrannon Road area of Loughgall on Tuesday 26 April.

Sometime between 6.30pm and 7pm an unknown male forced his way into a house in the area.

When confronted by the householder, a man in his eighties, the intruder pushed him against the kitchen counter before stealing his wallet.

The intruder is described as being aged in his 20’s or 30’s and was wearing a grey coloured coat, grey trousers and a hat.

The victim was not injured but was left shaken by the ordeal.

Detective Constable Victoria Holmes is asking witnesses, or anyone with information that could assist the investigation, to contact Detectives in Lurgan on 101. Information can also be passed anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
