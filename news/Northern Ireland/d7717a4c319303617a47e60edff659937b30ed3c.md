During the school holidays, many children may be spending more time online than they normally do. Whilst the internet can be great for learning, communicating and playing, there are many ways that children and young people can be contacted and exploited online.

Detective Chief Inspector Gary McDonald from PSNI's Public Protection Branch said: "I'd urge parents to talk to their children and young people about being safe online. It's important to make your child aware of online dangers and make sure they know that they can speak to someone if anything or anyone online causes them concern.

Make sure you know:

What your child's online presence is
What apps and websites are they using
What access they have to messages being received via their phones, tablets and computer games consoles
Who they are communicating with
If their location is visible online

Public Protection Branch detectives work to target those who seek to abuse and exploit our children and bring offenders before the courts. However, protecting and safeguarding our children should be everyone's business."
