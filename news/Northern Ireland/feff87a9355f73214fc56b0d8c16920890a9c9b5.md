Crossbow seized in Carrickfergus

Police in Carrickfergus responded to reports that a large crowd of males had gathered in the Castlemara estate yesterday evening, Friday 1 July.

Superintendent Emma Bond said: “Reports suggested some of the males were masked and may have been armed with weapons such as hammers.

Officers attended and dispersed the crowd seizing a number of items including a crossbow.

A 36 year old male and a 46 year old male were arrested.”

The arrested males were later charged on Saturday afternoon, the 46 year old with riotous behaviour and the 36 year old with placing a dangerous object on a road. Both are due to appear in court on 28 July.

As is usual procedure the charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
