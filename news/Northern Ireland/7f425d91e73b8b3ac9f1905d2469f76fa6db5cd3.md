Detectives from the PSNI's Major Investigation Team have launched a murder enquiry following the death of a 32 year old woman who died in hospital last night following a serious assault at a property in Lisburn on Sunday 22nd March.

Detective Chief Inspector Michelle Shaw, from the MIT, said: "Natasha Melendez, originally from Venezuela, was assaulted at a house in Finch Gardens last month and was being treated in hospital for her injuries. Sadly she has now died and my thoughts today are with her parents and wider family circle.

"A 30 year old man and a 23 year old woman who were arrested in connection with her death have been released pending further investigation.

"I would appeal to anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the Finch Gardens area of Lisburn on March 22 to contact police on 101 quoting reference number 208 23/03/20. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime."
