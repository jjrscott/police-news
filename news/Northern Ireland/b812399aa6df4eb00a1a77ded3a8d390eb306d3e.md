Detectives are investigating after thieves targeted an off license in Belfast twice in one day.

The robberies, which were carried out by two different suspects, occurred at around midday and 8pm at the premises on the Grosvenor Road.

In the first incident a male wearing a cream hoody, dark jeans, black shoes and a blue disposable face mask was buzzed in and went behind the till. He threatened staff with a metal weapon before fleeing with a sum of cash.

In the later robbery a male wearing a white t-shirt, blue jeans, black trainers and a facemask threatened staff with a screwdriver and made off with a sum of cash.

Detective Sergeant Rachel Miskelly said: "These robberies were terrifying ordeals for the staff involved and at this stage there does not appear to be any link between the two. I am appealing for the public's help in identifying and locating the two individuals involved. Please call 101, quoting references 807 and 1799 of 25/07/20, or submit a report online using our non-emergency reporting form via http://www.psni.police.uk/makeareport/.
