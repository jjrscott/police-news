Further malicious calls made to schools

Chief Superintendent Garry Eaton said: “PSNI are investigating a further series of malicious communications to schools across Northern Ireland today. At this stage there is no information to suggest the incidents are terrorist-related, however enquiries continue to establish the facts. We continue to investigate who is responsible and whether these incidents are linked to similar calls made to seven schools earlier this week.

"Anyone with information should contact police on the non-emergency number 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.”
