* Derry City & Strabane

Detectives are investigating a deliberate fire at a Catholic church in Derry/Londonderry last night, Friday 24 May.

Detective Constable Fielding said: "An outbuilding adjacent to Holy Family on Aileach Road was set alight at around 10.30pm. The blaze spread to the church and nearby parochial house causing damage to both. The outbuilding was completely destroyed.

At this stage we believe two males may have been involved in starting this fire and we are keen to identify them. We would like to hear from anyone who was in the area at around the time of the fire or anyone who may have information regarding this crime. The number to call is 101, please quote reference 2311 24/05/19."
