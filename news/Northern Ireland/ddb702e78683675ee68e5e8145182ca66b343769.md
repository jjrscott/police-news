Results Night Out Advice

With A Level and AS results being issued today, police are urging students to be safe when planning any post-results party nights out.

Temporary Chief Superintendent Simon Walls said: “We understand that young people want to go out and celebrate their results after all their hard work. Sometimes high spirits can go a little too far with young people overindulging in alcohol and getting into trouble.

“I want to remind our young people that each of us is responsible for our own actions, even under the influence of alcohol. A criminal record for assault or a public order offence can have a real impact on future career prospects. Don’t take the risk.

“We also want to make sure anyone planning to go out to celebrate their results puts as much thought into how they are getting home at the end of night as they do into how they are getting there and what they are wearing. It's a good idea to have your lift home arranged or taxi pre-booked before you go out.

“It's also important that friends look out for each other. Be responsible and stick together.

“Finally, I hope you got the results you deserve. And have a good and safe night.”
