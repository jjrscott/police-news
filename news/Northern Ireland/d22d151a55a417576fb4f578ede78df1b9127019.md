A man has been arrested following a hijacking in Dundonald last night, Saturday 19 January.

The driver of a Translink bus was threatened by a man armed with a knife at the bus stop on Cairnsmore Avenue in Ballybeen shortly before 8pm. The man forced the bus driver to drive for a distance before forcing him and passengers off the bus at knifepoint.

The bus was then involved in a collision a short distance away at which point the hijacker fled.

Police arrested the 33 year old suspect in Millars Lane a short time later. He remains in custody at present.

Any witnesses to the incident are asked to contact police by calling 101, quoting reference 1229 19/01/19.
