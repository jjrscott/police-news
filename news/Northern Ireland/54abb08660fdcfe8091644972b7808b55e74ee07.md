Update on St Patrick's Day policing operation in Belfast

Over the last two days Police in Belfast made a total of 15 arrests in and around the city centre and Holylands areas.

The arrests, linked to the St Patrick’s Day celebrations in the city, were for a range of public order offences such as disorderly behaviour, resisting arrest and minor assaults, including assaults on police.

Superintendent Melanie Jones said, “Thankfully there was no repeat of the disgraceful levels of behaviour that we saw in the Holylands last year however, police and partner agencies responded to numerous reports of unacceptable anti-social conduct and young people drinking alcohol in the street. In fact, the majority of those arrested were under the influence of alcohol.

“A significant police and partnership operation was in place to help ensure the celebration passed off in a largely peaceful fashion and, with the exception of a few, most people who attended the city centre parade, or who celebrated independently, did so in a good natured and respectful fashion.

“A clean-up operation will obviously take place today and, in due course, police along with partner agencies, and in consultation with the local community, will review all of the planning for St Patrick’s Day and its associated events and will take away whatever learning there is to improve the experience in future for residents and visitors alike.”
