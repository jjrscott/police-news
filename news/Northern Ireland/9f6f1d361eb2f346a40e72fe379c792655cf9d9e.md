Police are appealing for information after a report of criminal damage in the Millburn Park area of Cookstown this morning (Monday, March 4).

Sergeant John Dornan said: "Sometime between 9:45 am and 10:15 am this morning, it was reported that graffiti was spray painted onto a property in the area.

"Enquiries are continuing and the incident is being treated as a racially motivated hate crime.

"We would appeal to anyone who witnessed anything suspicious in the area at that time to contact police on 101, quoting reference number 305 of 4/3/19.

Alternatively, information can be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime."
