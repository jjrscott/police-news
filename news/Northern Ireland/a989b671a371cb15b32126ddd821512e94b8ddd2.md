* Belfast

Detectives are appealing for information following the report of an aggravated burglary at a house in the Sunnyside Street area of Belfast in the early hours of this morning, Sunday, 5 May.

At approximately 3.45am a male awoke to find an unknown man standing in the bedroom holding a knife. This man asked for money, which he was given. He then fled the scene with a sum of cash and an Apple watch.

A female occupant was also present in the house at the time of the incident. The man and woman were not injured, however they were both left extremely shaken by their ordeal.

Detective Sergeant Maguire would appeal to anyone who noticed any suspicious activity in the area of Sunnyside Street in the early hours of this morning, or anyone who has information that could assist detectives with their enquiries, to contact them at Musgrave on the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 309 05/05/19. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.
