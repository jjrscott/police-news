* Fermanagh & Omagh

Detectives are investigating an arson attack at a Fermanagh farm that killed three animals.

Detective Constable Linda Strawbridge said: “The blaze at a large shed on Killsmullen Road in Tedd is understood to have broken out at around 10.30pm on 26 September.

The shed housed a cow and two calves and contained high value farm equipment including tractors. Sadly the animals died as a result of the fire and the equipment was completely destroyed.

The Fire Service has now determined that the fire was started deliberately and the matter has been passed to police. I am asking anyone who was in the area at around the time the fire was discovered or who may have any information that could assist us, to please call 101, quoting reference number 329 28/09/18.”
