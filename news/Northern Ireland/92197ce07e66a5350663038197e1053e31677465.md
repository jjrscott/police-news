Detectives from PSNI's Criminal Investigation Branch welcome the charges brought by An Garda Siochana in relation to the investigation into the abduction and assault of Kevin Lunney on 17 September.

Four men appeared before Virginia District Court in Cavan earlier this morning, Tuesday 26th September.

Detective Chief Inspector Julie Mullan said: "I welcome the fact that four men have been charged by An Garda Siochana but want to make it clear, this does not signal the end of our joint investigation. We continue to work closely with our colleagues in An Garda Siochana and I am still appealing for anyone with any information in relation to this attack to contact us on the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference number 1748 of 17/09/19.

"Alternatively if someone would prefer to provide information without giving their details they can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime."
