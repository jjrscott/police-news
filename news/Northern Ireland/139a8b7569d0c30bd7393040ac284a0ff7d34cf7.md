Benzocaine seized in Grimsby - Update

A 41 year old man arrested in the Grimsby area on Wednesday as part of a PSNI investigation into drugs supply will appear at Londonderry MC today.

Detective Inspector Pete Mullan from Reactive and Organised Crime said: “He is charged with encouraging or assisting offences linked to the supply of class A drugs and money laundering.”

One tonne of benzocaine which can be used as a bulking agent for cocaine was uncovered in the Grimsby area searches which were conducted with assistance from Humberside police.
