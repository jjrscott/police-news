East Strand Car Park in Portrush, on Tuesday 12th June, was the scene for the delivery of the ‘Flame of Hope’ to the final team of the PSNI Law Enforcement Torch Run for Special Olympics. ASU had carried the flame by air securely contained within in a miners lamp, and upon arrival it was handed over to team leaders Constable Michael Allen and Constable Andy Watson, along with Special Olympics Ulster athletes and new honorary pilots Kirsty Neill, Sophie Carson and Lucia Carrigan. Also in attendance at the event were pupils from the four Portrush Primary Schools, officers from Portrush Neighbourhood Policing Team, Portrush RNLI and Portrush Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service personnel.

The ‘Flame of Hope’ then made its way to Dublin for the Opening Ceremony of the Special Olympics Ireland Summer Games, where Kirsty, Sophie and Lucia were all medal winners in their respective sports for Team Ulster. On the way to the ceremony in Dublin, which was attended by Assistant Chief Constable Stephen Martin OBE, Garda Assistant Commisioner Orla McPartlin and over 3000 school pupils, the PSNI Torch Run Team visited Portrush, Coleraine, Belfast and Newry.

PSNI Law Enforcement Torch Run coordinator, retired Inspector Jeremy Adams, thanked the PSNI Air Support Unit for their continued support for the Special Olympics and Law Enforcement Torch Run.

Detective Chief Inspector Denis Murray, from PSNI Air Support Unit, said: “It was not only a great honour to deliver the ‘Flame of Hope’ but also a privilege. I am very proud of my team for their dedication and efforts in supporting this very worthwhile cause, and for their daily commitment to keep people and the communities we serve, safe.”
