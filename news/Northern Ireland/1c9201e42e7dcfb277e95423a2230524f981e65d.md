A recovery operation is set to take place today, Sunday 19th July, after a vehicle was found in the River Bann at the New Ferry Road in Bellaghy.

The Ford Orion, which was discovered by local Community Search and Rescue on Saturday 18th July, is potentially linked to the long term missing person James Patterson, who went missing in 1991.

Once the vehicle has been removed from the water, it will be subject to forensic examinations.
