Police have welcomed the sentence handed down to Christopher Crawford at Antrim Crown Court today in relation to a shooting in Garvagh in 2017.

The 27 year old pleaded guilty last month to four charges including unlawfully and maliciously wounding the victim, Mark Holmes, following a shooting incident in the Main Street area of the village on December 10th, 2017.

Today he received a sentence of 42 months, half of which will be on licence, for wounding with intent, common assault, possession of a firearm with intent and carrying a loaded shotgun in a public place without lawful authority.

Detective Inspector Peter McKenna said: "It is unacceptable for anyone to bring weapons on to a public street and fire shots. This reckless action posed enormous risk and caused undue fear in a quiet rural community and we welcome the custodial sentence handed down by the Judge today."
