* Belfast

Police investigating the report of a burglary in Madrid Street last night (Sunday, 16 December) in east Belfast are appealing for witnesses and information.

Sergeant Grant said: “We received a report shortly after 8pm that a masked man had entered a house and used force to take a handbag from the female occupant of the house. We believe this occurred around 7:45pm.

“While the woman, aged in her seventies, was not physically injured, she was left badly shaken by the incident.

“The suspect is described as being tall, of thin build and was wearing a dark-coloured jacket and what was described a s a ‘scary’ mask.

“I want to appeal to anyone who was in the Madrid Street area last night, between 7:45pm and 8:05pm and saw any suspicious activity to get in touch with on the non emergency number 101, quoting reference number 1195 of 16/12/18."

Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.
