Drugs and Cash Seized

Police have arrested two men and seized a substantial amount of suspected herbal cannabis and cash.

The suspects, aged 25 and 40, were arrested last night after police stopped a car in the Trench Road area, Derry/Londonderry and a van on the Toombridge Bypass at Hillhall Road.

A substantial amount of suspected herbal cannabis with an estimated street value of approximately £280k was located in the car and approximately £10,400 in cash was located in the van.

The two suspects are currently in police custody.

Detective Inspector Tom McClure, from Reactive and Organised Crime Branch, said “We remain committed to making Northern Ireland a hostile environment for those individuals and groups who are involved in major drugs crime.

“We will continue to work to identify them, disrupt their activities, arrest them and place them before the courts. We will also seek to ensure that they do not derive any material benefit from their illegal activities.”

Anyone with information about drugs or any illegal activity can contact police on 101 or information can be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
