Attempted theft - Park Street, Ballyclare

A 34 year old man has been arrested following information received from two members of the public of a car acting suspiciously in the Ballyclare area on the evening of Monday 16 May and the early hours of Tuesday 17 May.

Just before 3.50am on Tuesday, police received a report that a car and a man were acting suspiciously around a car sales showroom in the Park Street area of Ballyclare. Police attended and found that a car in the premises had been damaged. The 34 year old man was arrested a short time later on suspicion of criminal damage, going equipped for theft, attempted theft and possession of a class C controlled drug.

Sergeant McIlroy said: “Late on Monday evening, we received a report of a car acting suspiciously in the Carrickfergus Road area. This turned out to be the same car that was later reported to be acting suspiciously in the Park Street area. The information we received from the two members of the public was vital in this arrest being made and it serves as an excellent example of police and the community working together to get good results.

“The 34 year old man currently remains in custody assisting police with their enquiries.”
