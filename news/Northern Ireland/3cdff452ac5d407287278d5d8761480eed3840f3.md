Detectives investigating the brutal murder of 43 year old Jim Donegan in front of schoolchildren and parents in West Belfast earlier this month are appealing to motorists who were in the area on the day of the killing to come forward.

They would like to speak to anyone who was driving along the Glen Road around the time the lone gunman shot Jim in broad daylight on Tuesday (December 4th), as he sat in his red Porsche Panamera, registration JDZ34, waiting to pick up his 13 year old son.

Detective Chief Inspector Pete Montgomery said: "I would like to hear from anyone who was driving in the area of the Glen Road and Clonelly Avenue around 3.10pm and just afterwards as I need to eliminate your car from my enquiries. I also need to see any dash-cam footage which could be of use to my investigation.

“Please come forward to police by calling 101 without delay as your dash-cam footage could hold vital clues.”
