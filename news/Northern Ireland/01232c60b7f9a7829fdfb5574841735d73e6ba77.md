It's believed sometime between 11:30pm on Wednesday night (19th February) and 10:30am today a set of car keys were stolen along with a silver Mercedes, a 'Longines' watch and a 'Hugo Boss' watch, a black leather wallet, and a sum of cash.

"The car was later located in the Newry area, and three males, aged 17, 19 and 20 were subsequently arrested.

"The males have been arrested on suspicion of offences, including burglary and aggravated vehicle taking causing damage to the vehicle.

"All three males remain in custody this evening.

"I want to appeal to anyone who was in the Oakwood Court area last night or during the early hours of this morning and saw anything o0ut of the ordinary or believes they may have seen this vehicle to call detectives on 101, quoting reference number 538 of 20/02/20.
