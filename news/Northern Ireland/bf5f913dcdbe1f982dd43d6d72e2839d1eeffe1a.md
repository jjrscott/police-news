Shooting incident: Main Street, Belleek

Police in Fermanagh are appealing for information following a shooting incident this morning in Belleek.

Chief Inspector Graham Dodds said: “Three armed men wearing balaclavas arrived at a hotel in Belleek’s Main Street shortly before 9.30am and fired one shot into the van of a contractor working there. No-one sustained any injuries but all involved are understandably shaken by today’s events.

“The men then made off in the direction of the border and local officers are working closely with An Garda Síochána to trace their movements.

“I would appeal to anyone who may have noticed any suspicious activity in the area or anyone who has any information about this incident to contact Police at Enniskillen on the non-emergency 101 number, quoting reference number 272 02/07/16.

Alternatively, if you would prefer to provide information without giving details, please contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800 555 111.”
