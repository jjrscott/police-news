* Belfast

Detectives are appealing for information and witnesses following a report of an aggravated burglary at a house in the Cupar Way area of Belfast last night, Thursday, 3 December.

At approximately 11.00pm two men, one of whom had what is believed to be a hammer, forced their way into a house. The intruder who was brandishing the hammer went up the stairs in the property and assaulted the male occupant who has attended hospital where he is receiving treatment for his injuries.

The second intruder stole a purse containing cash.

Detective Sergeant McCallum said: "During this incident there was also a woman and children in the property. However, they were not injured but have been left badly shaken by the incident.

"This was a despicable act of violence and more so as there were children in the house. It was a traumatic ordeal, which no family should ever have to experience.

"I would appeal to anyone who saw or heard anything last night to contact detectives at Musgrave on the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 2006 03/12/20, or submit a report online using our non-emergency reporting form via http://www.psni.police.uk/makeareport/. You can also contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or online at http://crimestoppers-uk.org/
