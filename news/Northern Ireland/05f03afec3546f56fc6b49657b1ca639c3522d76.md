Detectives in Coleraine are appealing for information following a security alert in Armoy earlier today (Saturday 31st August).

At around 4:50am, police received a report of a suspicious device in the Fair Hill Street area. A number of residents were evacuated as a public safety operation was carried out.

ATO were tasked to the scene. The object has been taken away for further examination. It has since been declared a hoax. Residents have since been allowed to return to their homes. No roads were closed during the operation.

Detective Inspector Peter McKenna said: "I want to thank the community for their co-operation as we worked to make the scene safe.

I would appeal to anyone who noticed anyone acting suspiciously in the area to contact detectives in Coleraine on the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 298 of 31/08/19. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime."
