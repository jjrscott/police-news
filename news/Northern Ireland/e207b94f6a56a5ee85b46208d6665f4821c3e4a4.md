Detectives from PSNI Paramilitary Crime Task Force have seized suspected Cocaine with an estimated street value of more than Â£7,000 during a proactive search operation in the Andersonstown area of west Belfast yesterday, Thursday 30 July.

A 33 year old man was subsequently arrested and remains in police custody this morning.

Detective Inspector Hamilton said: "These searches are further evidence that PCTF are proactively investigating drugs criminality linked to paramilitaries.

Drugs cause misery to users and their families and the proceeds of their sale go to fund paramilitary activity.

We continue to target those criminals who are involved in the sale and supply of illegal drugs and will aim to disrupt their activities at every opportunity. I would encourage members of the community who may have information that could assist our efforts to tackle the blight of drugs, to please get in touch. You can call 101, or you can submit a report online using our non-emergency reporting form via http://www.psni.police.uk/makeareport/ .

The independent charity Crimestoppers can also be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111 or online at http://crimestoppers-uk.org/ "

The Police Service of Northern Ireland, HM Revenue & Customs and the National Crime Agency have established the Paramilitary Crime Task Force to tackle criminality linked to paramilitarism as part of the Executive's action plan on tackling paramilitary activity, criminality and organised crime.
