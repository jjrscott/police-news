Officers recognised for their bravery

_The Chief Constable George Hamilton presents certificates to L to R Constable Richard Sharkey, Constable Dean Lovell and Constable Ade Foster._

Three police officers who rescued a man from a house fire in Castledawson last year have been recognised for their bravery.

Constables Richard Sharkey, Ade Foster and Dean Lovell received certificates from Chief Constable George Hamilton.

The officers were on patrol just after 10.30pm on October 10th when they came across a fire in a mid-terrace house in New Row. Neighbours informed the officers that the occupant was still in the house and the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service were en route.

Constables Foster and Lovell immediately entered the building despite the fact that there was smoke throughout the premises except at floor level. They located the occupant who was unconscious and pulled him out of the property.

As they did so Constable Sharkey commenced an evacuation including checking neighbouring properties to ensure that the fire or smoke had not spread.

The officers provided first aid to the man until paramedics arrived and he was taken to hospital for further treatment.

The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service Station Officer who attended the scene said he believed that had the officers not intervened, the occupant would have most likely died as a result of smoke inhalation.

Chief Constable George Hamilton said: “The swift actions of Constables Sharkey, Foster and Lovell undoubtedly saved this man’s life and I cannot praise them highly enough for their bravery during this incident.

“Their actions exemplified policing at its finest and show how the Police Service of Northern Ireland works on a day and daily basis to keep people safe.”
