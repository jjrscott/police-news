Detectives are appealing for information following the report of two males being assaulted in the Elmfield Street area of Belfast, in the early hours of Monday morning (March 18th).

Detective Constable Gill said: "We received a report that two men had been attacked sometime between 12.30 am and 1.00 am on Monday morning. It is believed that the assault was committed by a number of men.

"One of the men assaulted, who is aged in his 50s, suffered significant facial injuries, which required surgery. Whilst the other man who is in his 20s also suffered injuries.

"Our enquiries into this incident are ongoing and I am appealing for anyone who witnessed the assault or who has any information which could assist us with our investigation to contact Detectives at Musgrave on 101 quoting reference number 876 of 18/03/19."

Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.
