Detectives from PSNIs Serious Crime Branch have charged a 20 year old man with the murder of Stefan Zait in Ardglass earlier this week.

The 45 year old Romanian national died on Thursday (24 May) from serious head injuries he sustained during a brutal and senseless attack in broad daylight on Tuesday morning.

The man charged with his murder is expected to appear before Newtownards Magistrates Court on Saturday 26 May.

A 50 year old man and 53 year old woman who were also arrested in connection with Mr Zait's death remain in police custody.
