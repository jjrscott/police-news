A 53 year old man from Belfast has today, Thursday, 26 April, been sentenced at Lisburn Magistrates Court to 5 months imprisonment, placed on the sex offenders register for 7 years and subject to a SOPO for 7 years.

Inspector Michelle Shaw from the PSNI Public Protection Branch said: “This was a difficult ordeal for the victim in this case and I would like to take the opportunity to praise him for firstly coming forward to police and also for having the courage to see this case through the courts.

“I would encourage anyone who has been a victim of sexual abuse to come forward and report it to police so that we can thoroughly investigate and bring any suspects before the courts. They will be treated with the utmost sensitivity by our highly trained officers, who will be there to guide and reassure them through every step of the process. It is because of the bravery of survivors of sexual abuse that cases such as this can be brought before the courts and the culprits brought to justice.”
