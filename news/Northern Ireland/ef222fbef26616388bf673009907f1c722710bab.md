The Police Service of Northern Ireland has issued some safety advice for Northern Ireland residents on what to do in the event of a firearm or weapons attack.

It’s part of the launch of an advisory video by National Counter Terrorism Police UK, an alliance of UK Police Services including PSNI.

PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Barbara Gray said: “Police services across the UK work together on an ongoing basis to develop and improve our approach to countering terrorist attacks against our citizens both at home and abroad. A huge part of this is increasing public awareness and vigilance, and ensuring our residents know what action to take in the unlikely event of an attack.

This latest guidance is based on what we know has been effective from speaking with those who have been involved in similar instances and we know that it saves lives.

Our advice to those who find themselves caught up in an incident is to ‘Run, Hide, Tell’ -

RUN - to a place of safety. This is better than trying to surrender or negotiate.

HIDE - it is better to hide than confront. Barricade yourself in, turn your phone to silent and use only when it safe to do so.

TELL - Alert police. Make sure you know the local emergency number - in the UK it’s 999, for EU countries it’s 112.

You should also TELL others nearby of the danger so they can take similar evasive actions.

For people with disabilities or for whom running may be difficult, they should make every effort to move away from the danger. Others should also assist more vulnerable individuals where it is possible and practical to do so.

I would stress that the chance of becoming caught up in a terrorist incident remains low however we feel that it is important that we raise awareness and that the public remains vigilant with an action plan in place should it be required.

A few minutes of your time is all it takes to arm yourself with the knowledge that could keep you and your family safe.”
