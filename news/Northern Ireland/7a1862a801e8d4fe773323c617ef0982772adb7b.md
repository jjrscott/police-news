* Belfast

Detectives are appealing for witnesses following an arson attack on a property in north Belfast this morning, Wednesday 05 September.

Shortly before 9.45am it was reported that an unoccupied flat on Woodland Avenue was on fire. It is believed that entry had been gained to the property before the fire was started in the kitchen area. Police and NIFRS attended and the fire was extinguished. Damage was caused to the property as a result.

Detectives are treating this as arson endangering life and Detective Sergeant Corrigan is appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident or anyone with any information that can assist with the investigation to contact detectives in Musgrave on 101 quoting reference 295 05/09/18. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.
