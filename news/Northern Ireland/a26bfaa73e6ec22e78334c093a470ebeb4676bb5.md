Police are appealing for information following the report of a paramilitary style attack in the Ballymagroarty area of Derry/Londonderry last night.

Police received a report that a man was shot in the leg in a paramilitary-style attack at a house just before 11pm last night, Thursday 30 August.

Detective Inspector Stephanie Finlay said: “We received a report that a group of young males with their faces covered, knocked at the door of a house and forced a man to lie down on the ground, before firing a shot at him.

“The man was shot in the left leg but the bullet passed through and also grazed the back of his right leg. He was treated for his injuries in hospital.

“This was a brutal attack and yet another example of how criminal groups seek to control communities through fear and violence.

“If anyone has any information that could be useful to our investigation, they should phone detectives at Strand Road on 101, quoting reference number 1369 of 30/8/18.”

Alternatively, information can also be provide to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.
