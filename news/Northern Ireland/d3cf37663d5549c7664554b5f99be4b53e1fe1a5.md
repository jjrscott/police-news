Cannabis cultivation charge – Limavady

A 25 year old man has been charged with conspiracy to cultivate cannabis, dishonestly using electricity and encouraging or assisting offences in relation to the cultivation of cannabis. He is due to appear at Limavady Magistrates Court on Thursday 9 June.

As is normal procedure, all charges are reviewed by the PPS.

Detective Chief Inspector Colin Gillis said: “The charge follows the discovery of a cannabis factory in the Limavady area following a proactive search by detectives from Reactive and Organised Crime Branch on Wednesday 16 March where herbal cannabis worth over £100,000 was seized. Two men aged 46 and 53 were arrested at the time and were later charged to appear at Londonderry Magistrates Court on Friday 18 March. The 25 year old man was arrested on Thursday 17 March (when he was 24) and was subsequently released on police bail pending further enquiries before he was charged on Friday 20 May.”
