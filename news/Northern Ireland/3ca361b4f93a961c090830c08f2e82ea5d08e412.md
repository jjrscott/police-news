Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said: "Following reports of a number of officers from Antrim Station being unwell, these officers have undergone testing for Covid-19. At this time, eight of these officers have tested positive for the virus.

"We have undertaken, and we will continue to undertake a range of appropriate measures, in line with public health advice and guidance, to address the issue. This includes the closure of both Antrim and Newtownabbey stations in order to conduct a deep clean.

"Colleagues from across the district are also self-isolating and will undergo testing for Covid-19 tested.

"I want to reassure public that we have plans in place to ensure continuance of service delivery to keep our people and our communities safe.

"We are also working to identify any other risks arising from this outbreak and will address those with our health care partners."
