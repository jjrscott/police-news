* Belfast

Police are investigating the report of a vehicle hijacking in the North Queen Street area of North Belfast last night (Tuesday 13 May).

Sergeant Anderson said: "We received a report at 10:45pm that as a fast food delivery driver was making a delivery he was ordered to get out of his vehicle, a blue Volkswagen Polo.

"Thankfully, no force was used, and the victim was physically uninjured. However, he was left shaken by his ordeal, which must have been frightening for him.

"I want to appeal to anyone who was in the North Queen Street area around 10:45pm and witnessed the incident, or who knows the whereabouts of the vehicle, or has information which may assist our investigation to call us on the non emergency number 101, quoting reference number 1611 of 13/05/19."

Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.
