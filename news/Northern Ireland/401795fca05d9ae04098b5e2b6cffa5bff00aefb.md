* Armagh City, Banbridge & Craigavon

Police in Armagh are investigating a petrol bomb attack at a house at Alexander Avenue in the early hours of Sunday 10th September.

Sergeant Buchanan said: “Police received a report at around 00.45am on Sunday morning, that a brick had been thrown through the front window of the house followed by a petrol bomb, which ignited in the living room. A male occupant of the house was able to quickly extinguish the resulting fire which left scorch damage inside the room. There were no reports of any injuries. A number of men, dressed in dark clothing, were seen leaving the area on foot following the incident.”

“Our enquiries are currently ongoing and I would ask anyone with any information which could assist with our investigation to contact police in Armagh on 101 quoting reference number 79 10/09/17. Information can also be given anonymously through the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
