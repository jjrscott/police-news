Police in Belfast are appealing for witnesses after a report that criminal damage was caused to a house in the Clementine Drive area of Belfast on Thursday, 29 November.

Constable Brian Carroll said: “It was reported that sometime between 11 am and 11:50 pm, two windows had been smashed and a paint bomb was thrown inside the property.

“A further paint bomb is believed to also have been thrown at the back window of the house.
