Detectives in Belfast are appealing for information following the report of an aggravated burglary in the Palestine Street area of Belfast in the early hours of this morning (Friday, June 21).

Detective Sergeant Sam McCallum said: "We received a report that at around 5.00 am, a man had entered a property in the Palestine Street area armed with a knife and demanded cash.

"The man threatened the occupants before leaving, it was discovered a short time later that a Samsung Galaxy mobile phone had been taken.

"He is described as being approximately 5'11", of slim build, and believed to have been wearing a black coat with a hood and black bottoms.

"A woman and a man who were present in the property at the time were not injured, however they were left very shocked by the incident.

"Enquiries are continuing and we are appealing to anyone who witnessed anything suspicious in the area to contact detectives in Musgrave on 101, quoting reference number 281 of 21/06/19."

Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.
