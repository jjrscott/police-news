* Fermanagh & Omagh

Detectives from Public Protection Branch investigating allegations of historical sexual abuse in County Fermanagh have made a further arrest, bringing the total number of arrests to 11.

The latest arrest, a man aged in his 50s, was made last night (Tuesday, 4th August) in the Fermanagh area.

Detective Superintendent Gary McDonald from Public Protection Branch said: "I want to provide an update on the arrest of 11 people that were made in the Fermanagh, Belfast and Derry/Londonderry areas yesterday.

"All 11, aged between 54 and 78, have since been released on bail, pending further enquires.

"As these are very much live and ongoing investigations, it would be inappropriate to comment any further, or provide any further detail about any of these arrests.

"However, I want to reassure both victims and the local community we are continuing to work on the reports made to us over the past year."
