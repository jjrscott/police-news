We continue our efforts to keep people safe by removing drugs from the streets and arresting anyone suspected of involvement in their supply. I appeal to anyone who has any concerns or information about illegal drugs to contact their local Police on the non-emergency number 101. Alternatively, if someone would prefer to provide information without giving their details they can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800 555 111.”
