Detective Sergeant McAuley said: “This has taken a substantial amount of drugs out of circulation and reduced the harm they cause to communities.

“This is an ongoing example of how the PSNI is keeping people safe while policing in the community.

”Enquiries into the seizure are ongoing. Police would appeal to anyone with information to contact them on 101. Alternatively, information can be given anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
