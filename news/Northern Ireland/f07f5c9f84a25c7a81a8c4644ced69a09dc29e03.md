Investigation update into Bangor shooting

****Police continue to appeal for information in relation to yesterday's shooting in Bangor.****

****Senior Investigating Officer Detective Richard Campbell said “James Colin Horner, known as Colin, was shot and fatally wounded yesterday afternoon, Sunday 28th May in the car park of Sainsbury’s supermarket in Bangor. He was 35 years old and with his 3 year old son at the time of the shooting.**

 **It was hugely barbaric act and something that will undoubtedly live with this young boy for the rest of his life.**

 **My specific appeal lines relate to the vehicle he was driving when he left his partner’s home in the Balloo Road area of Bangor around 1.30pm.**

 **He was driving a black Nissan Pulsar car, registration XFZ 4706 and arrived in the car park around 2.30pm.**

 **I am keen to trace his movements during that one hour period.**

 **I am also keen to establish the movements of a red Ford Mondeo car which was seen speeding away from the scene around 2.50pm just after Mr Horner was shot. I believe one of its occupants was wearing a dark hoodie type top mask with possibly a dust mask covering his face.**

 **This vehicle bore the registration GKZ 7996 but we have established these were false number plates. It was later found burnt out at Kerrs Road, in the Six Road Ends area of Bangor, close to a local equestrian centre.**

 **There may have been another vehicle which ferried the gunman and his accomplice away from Kerrs Road. I need help to establish what that vehicle was.**

 **I would urge anyone who may have seen any of these vehicles to contact us. I would urge anyone who may have mobile phone footage, dash-cam footage or local businesses in the area with CCTV footage to come forward to detectives in Bangor.**

 **D/Supt Campbell concluded, “This was a totally reckless attack in the middle of a busy shopping area on a bank holiday weekend. We know at least three shots were fired with a stray bullet actually hitting another vehicle in the car park.**

 **Anyone with information is urged to contact detectives in Bangor or anonymously through Crimestoppers.****
