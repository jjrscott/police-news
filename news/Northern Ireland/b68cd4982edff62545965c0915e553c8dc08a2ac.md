Aggravated Burglary â€“ Fort Road, Belfast

Detectives are appealing for information following the report of an aggravated burglary at a house in the Fort Road area of Belfast last night, Monday, 2 May.

At approximately 9.50pm the male occupant of the house answered a knock to his door. Upon opening the door two men forced their way inside and placed the occupant in a room and searched the property. They took two sets of keys and locked the house and left.

It is believed there may have been a third man involved.

The householder was not injured during this incident, however he was left very badly shaken.

Detective Sergeant James Johnston would appeal to anyone who may have witnessed any suspicious activity or anyone who has any information about this incident to contact Detectives at Reactive and Organised Crime at Lisburn PSNI Station on the non-emergency number 101. Or, if someone would prefer to provide information without giving their details they can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800 555 111.
