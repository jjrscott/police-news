Three men were arrested following an incident in the Bawnmore Grove area of Newtownabbey yesterday afternoon, Wednesday 25 May.

It was reported that a car matching the description had been seen in the area of Bawnmore Park on Sunday evening and the occupants had approached a young boy close to a shop in the area.
