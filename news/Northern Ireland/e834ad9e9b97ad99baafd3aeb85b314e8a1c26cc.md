Attempted robbery - Stewartstown Road, West Belfast

Detectives are appealing for information following two men acting suspiciously in the Stewartstown Road area of West Belfast on Thursday 7 April.

The two males were outside a chemist at approximately 5pm. When the two males were approached, one of them produced a suspected firearm and pointed it at a man before both made off on foot towards the Glasvey area.

Two men, both aged 21, were arrested a short time later in the Glasvey Drive area. One has since been released to be reported to the PPS for attempted robbery and attempted theft while both have been released on police bail pending further enquiries for conspiracy to rob and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life.

Detective Inspector Nigel Snoddy said: “One of the males was wearing a blue hooded top while the other was wearing a red hooded top. Both were of slim build and about 5’10” tall. I would ask anyone who may have noticed the two males acting suspiciously in the area to contact detectives at Musgrave Police Station on the non-emergency number 101. Or if someone would prefer to provide information without giving their details, they can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800 555 111.”
