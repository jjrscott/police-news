Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said: "Antrim and Newtownabbey Police Stations will reopen this evening to the public (Wednesday, August 26th) from 7pm.

"Both stations were closed at the weekend following confirmation that a number of our officers had tested positive for COVID-19.

"In line with public health guidance, we have ensured that appropriate steps were immediately taken to address and manage the issue. The health and welfare of members of the public attending our stations and those of our officers and staff are of paramount importance and we have commenced a phased return to duty for officers based in those stations as it is now assessed that it is safe to do so.

"Once again, I would like to reassure the public, that plans remain in place across the District to provide a service to the community and keep people safe."
