Detectives are investigating an aggravated burglary at a house in the Windsor Avenue area of Newtownards on Monday 24th July.

Detective Sergeant Andrews said: “A report was received on Monday morning that a man had entered a house in the area at around 10am through a rear window, threatened a male occupant with a knife and demanded money. A sum of money was handed over before the occupant was tied up and left in a bedroom by the assailant, who was described as being aged in his 30’s, over six feet tall and wearing a grey tracksuit. The occupant then managed to release himself before raising the alarm. He was not injured but was left suffering from shock.”

“ I would ask anyone who noticed any suspicious activity in the Windsor Avenue area this morning or anyone with any information about this incident to contact detectives in Bangor on 101 quoting reference 307 24/07/17 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.”
