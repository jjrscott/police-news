* Belfast

Detectives from PSNI’s Criminal Investigation Branch today carried out seven searches in the Belfast and Greater Belfast areas in relation to ongoing investigations into criminal activity linked to North Belfast UVF.

Detective Inspector Heather Whoriskey said: “The searches took place in residential and commercial properties during which three people were arrested.

“A 56 year old woman and 39 year old man were arrested in Newtownabbey and a 56 year old man was arrested in North Belfast. They have all been taken to Musgrave Serious Crime Suite for further questioning.

“Today’s operation demonstrates the PSNI’s commitment to tackling all types of criminality linked to paramilitaries. While these searches and arrests focused specifically on the North Belfast UVF, we will continue to target all paramilitary groups and disrupt their illegal activities which only serve to blight the communities they operate in.”
