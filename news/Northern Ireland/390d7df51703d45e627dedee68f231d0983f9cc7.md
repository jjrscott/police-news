Detectives are appealing for witnesses following the report of an attempted robbery of a man on Monday, 25 March.

Shortly before 7.30pm as the injured party was drinking in licensed premises in Wilsons Court, Belfast he was approached by a man who produced a knife and demanded his wallet. As he stood up to challenge the suspect, he (the suspect) made off on foot in the direction of High Street.

The suspect is described as being in his mid-20's, with ginger hair, of slim build and wearing a grey zip up hoody and carrying an orange bag.

Detective Sergeant Conlan said: "I would appeal to anyone who was in the bar and saw the suspect, who we believe was in the premises for some time before the incident, to contact detectives at Musgrave on the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 1260 25/03/19. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime."
