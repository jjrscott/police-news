Police are appealing for information after a report of an assault at the Ligoniel Road area of north Belfast on Sunday morning (March 3).

Sergeant Tierney said: "Shortly before 11:15am, it was reported that a male in his 30's was assaulted by two unknown males in the area. The man received a cut to both his head and above his eye following the incident. The males are believed to have made off towards the Crumlin Road area. The man was taken to hospital for treatment to his injuries.

"Enquiries are continuing and at this stage, we are investigating this incident as a racially motivated hate crime.

"The males are described as being 5"8 in height, shaved heads and wearing dark jackets and jeans.

"We would appeal to anyone who witnessed the incident or who has any information which may assist with our enquiries to contact police on 101, quoting reference number 500 3/3/19."

Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.
