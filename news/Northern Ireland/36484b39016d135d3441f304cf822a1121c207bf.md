* Belfast

A petrol bomb was thrown at police in north Belfast early this morning, Sunday 15 April.

Officers were responding to reports of a suspicious vehicle in the Ardoyne Avenue area at around 1am when they came under attack from a crowd of stone throwers. Their vehicle was then struck by a petrol bomb close to Rosapenna Street.

Inspector Tommy Fairfield said: "Thankfully none of the crew were injured and they were subsequently able to locate the suspicious vehicle and seize it. A 19 year old man was arrested a short time later on suspicion of a range of driving offences.

It is unacceptable that police officers simply trying to do their job should be attacked however I am pleased with how professionally the crew conducted themselves, continuing to pursue their enquiries and keep people safe in the face of such an attack.

The arrested male remains in police custody this morning (Sunday) assisting us with our enquiries."
