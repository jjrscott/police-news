Detectives in Musgrave are appealing for information following the report of a hijacking in the Osman Street area of west Belfast last night (August 22nd).

Detective Inspector Kerry Brennan said: "At approximately 10.25 pm a man in his 40s was driving on Osman Street, when the vehicle slowed down to go over a speed bump, a male approached the Grey SEAT Altea and dragged the driver out.

"The driver managed to take the keys out of the vehicle and attempted to run off however the male has caught him and a physical fight ensued.

"The assailant has then produced a knife and held it up to the driver's face, at this stage the victim handed over the keys and the vehicle is then stolen.

"The man is described as being 5'9" or 5'10" tall of heavy build, wearing a brown coat which covered his face.

"The driver was uninjured but left shaken by the ordeal.

"We are appealing for anyone who was in the Osman Street area of Belfast at around this time and noticed any suspicious behaviour or may have dashcam footage to contact detectives in Musgrave on 101 quoting reference number CCS 2137 of 22/08/19."

Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.
