Man charged with robbery

A 27 year old man has been charged with robbery and is due to appear at Belfast Magistrates court in the morning.

It follows a robbery at an off sales on the Crumlin Road in north Belfast on Sunday 17 April.

At around 7.35pm a man armed with a knife had entered the premises and threatened staff before making off with a quantity of cigarettes and alcohol.

A 34 year old man who had also been arrested in connection with this incident has been released on bail pending further enquiries.

Detective Inspector Nigel Snoddy is keen to hear from witnesses or anyone who was on the Crumlin Road at the time of the robbery and who may be able to assist the investigation. Detectives can be contacted at the offices of Reactive and Organised Crime at Musgrave police station by calling 101.
