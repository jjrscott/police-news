* Armagh City, Banbridge & Craigavon

Today, Tuesday, 17 September, Detectives from the PSNI Organised Crime Branch, Grosvenor Road carried out a planned search of a house in the Moira area under the Misuse of Drugs Act.

As a result of this search police discovered a large quantity of suspected cannabis plants worth an estimated street value of Â£100,000.

Detective Sergeant Brian O'Neill said: "We will continue to do everything possible to prevent the supply of drugs and make people aware of the real danger posed to their health and their lives if they take illegal drugs or prescription drugs that have not been prescribed for them by a medical practitioner.

"Some people think that cannabis is harmless - this simply isn't true. It can damage your physical and mental health and it is the most used drug by people receiving treatment for drug addiction in Northern Ireland.

"I would appeal to anyone who is aware of any information about the supply of drugs to contact their local police on 101, so we can work together to do something about it.

"Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime."
