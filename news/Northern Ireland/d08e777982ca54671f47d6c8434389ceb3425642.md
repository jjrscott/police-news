Detectives from the PSNI’s Serious Crime Branch have launched a murder investigation into the death of a man, aged in his 50s, at a property in Millmount Court in Banbridge.

The man’s body was discovered at a house at around 4.50pm yesterday, Monday 9th July.

A 28 year old man, who was arrested last night, has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in police custody at this time.

Detective Chief Inspector Eamonn Corrigan, who is leading the investigation, said: “I am appealing to anyone who has any information to contact police. I am particularly keen to speak with anyone who was in the area of Millmount Court on the evenings of Friday 6th July and Saturday 7th July and noticed anything suspicious.

“Please call 101 quoting reference 1000 09/07/18. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.”
