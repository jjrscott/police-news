Officers from the Paramilitary Crime Task Force supported by local Neighbourhood officers and officers from Tactical Support Group, investigating criminality linked to South East Antrim UDA, carried out a number of planned searches in the Ballyclare and Carrickfergus areas over the past week.

On Wednesday, 3 June a number of items including cash were seized, and on Monday, 8 June following a series of four coordinated searches a number of items including suspected Class A controlled Drugs were seized in the Carrickfergus area.

Detective Inspector O'Neill said: "These searches are evidence that the PCTF will continue to investigate all aspects of criminality being carried out by anyone purporting to be operating under the convenient flag of a paramilitary organisation. Paramilitaries are not defenders of their communities, instead they are criminals who prey on vulnerable people and exploit any circumstances they can for their own gain.

"Anyone with information about any criminality linked to paramilitaries should contact police on 101 or anonymously through the Crimestoppers charity on 0800 555 111, which gives people the power to speak up and stop crime."

The Police Service of Northern Ireland, HM Revenue & Customs and the National Crime Agency have established the Paramilitary Crime Task Force to tackle criminality linked to paramilitarism as part of the Executive's action plan on tackling paramilitary activity, criminality and organised crime.
