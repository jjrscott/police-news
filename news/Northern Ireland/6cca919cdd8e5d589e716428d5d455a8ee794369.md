Men arrested following illegal parade: Kilwilkie, Lurgan

Twelve men were arrested following an unnotified parade in Lurgan on Saturday 28 May.

The males were detained on suspicion of offences under the Public Processions Act along with associated offences.

Supt. David Moore said, “The arrests were as a result of the subsequent policing operation into the parade, which took place in the Kilwilkie area, and concurrent investigation.”
