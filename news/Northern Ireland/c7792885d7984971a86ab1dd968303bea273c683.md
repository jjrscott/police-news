The Police Service of Northern Ireland has been running a three month pilot to trial a different style of uniform. The current uniform has been in existence since the formation of the Police Service and this trial has provided an opportunity for a number of officers to test modern workwear which is fit for purpose, practical and comfortable.

The pilot will come to an end on 17 January 2021 so this is your last chance to tell us what you think through the survey below.

Thank you for taking part.
