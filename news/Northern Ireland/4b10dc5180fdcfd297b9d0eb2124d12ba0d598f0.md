**Statement by the Chief Constable Simon Byrne QPM**

This morning I have written to both Barry McCaffrey and Trevor Birney offering them an unreserved apology for the distress and upset caused to them and their families following the execution of search warrants at their homes and business premises on 31 August 2018.

While the searches were planned and conducted at the direction of officers from Durham Constabulary, those officers were acting on behalf of the Police Service of Northern Ireland in an external capacity and I fully accept the ruling of the Lord Chief Justice that the search warrants were unlawful. The Police Service of Northern Ireland will be reviewing all findings of the judgment to ensure that all appropriate learning is taken.

I have notified both Mr McCaffrey and Mr Birney's legal representatives that I am keen to resolve all the outstanding matters through a process of mediation in order to bring this matter to a conclusion.

Until these issues are resolved the Police Service of Northern Ireland will be making no further comment.
