Gran Fondo Giro d'Italia a real success

Congratulations to everyone involved in making the Gran Fondo Giro d'Italia a real success.

Following the success of today’s Gran Fondo Giro d'Italia, Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said: “I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone who took the time and effort to come out and support the cyclists who were taking part in the event. It was wonderful to see so many people lining the route. For those who had to alter plans or rethink your journey, thank you for your understanding and patience. This was the third year which Northern Ireland has played host to the event and each year it has gone from strength to strength. This year there were almost 5,000 competitors who took part in race.

“Thank you to everyone who worked behind the scenes to make the event a success including the many volunteers and marshals”
