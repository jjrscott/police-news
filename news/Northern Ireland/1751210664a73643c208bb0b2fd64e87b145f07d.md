Theft of prescription medicines - William Street, Derry/Londonderry

Following the theft of a quantity of prescription medicines which included Diazepam, Tramadol and Zopiclone from a van which was parked in the William Street area of Derry/Londonderry at approximately 11.40am today, Wednesday, 13 April, Police are warning members of the public about the potential dangers of these drugs should they be taken without prescription.

Commenting on this theft, Inspector Tony Moore said: “I would urge the public to be vigilant and to ensure that they do not put their health at risk by purchasing medication from an illicit source. The medicines involved are potent and are subject to abuse. People should only take medicines in consultation with their healthcare professionals who have access to patient health records, who are qualified to assess their medical needs and can take into account the risks and benefits associated with every medicine.”

Continuing, Inspector Moore said: “I would ask the public if they are offered any medicines from an unregulated source or if they have any information about this theft to report it to the police on the non-emergency number 101. Alternatively if someone would prefer to provide information without giving their details they can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800 555 111. Information can also be passed to the Health Department's Medicines Regulatory Group.”
