Police have arrested a 26 year old man following an assault in the Lough Road area of Lurgan in the early hours of this morning (Tuesday 4th August).

Inspector Hanna said: "Shortly after midnight, it was reported that a number of persons were in a house in the area when an altercation occurred. One man then left the property before returning with a second male, they then threatened two males and assaulted them with a tyre iron. The suspects then left in a black Audi car and made off towards the William Street area. Two males were treated for injuries which are not thought to be serious. Damage was caused to the front door and the hallway of a property in the area.

"One man was later arrested on suspicion of threats to kill and aggravated burglary with intent to commit grievous bodily harm. He remains in police custody at this time.

"At this stage, one line of enquiry is that this may be a homophobic hate crime. Enquiries are continuing.
