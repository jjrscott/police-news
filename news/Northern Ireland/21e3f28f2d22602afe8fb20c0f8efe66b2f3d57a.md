The Police Service of Northern Ireland conducted more than 7,500 patrols across the country to keep people safe over the Christmas period.

During Operation Season's Greetings, the Service made 280 arrests for drink/drug driving, 579 drugs seizures, 203 drugs arrests and conducted 142 licensing checks, 1263 patrols at transport hubs/on public transport systems and 6329 crime prevention patrols.

The operation ran from 1st December, 2020 to the beginning of January and saw dedicated resources deployed across all districts in Northern Ireland to deter and detect criminality and provide visible reassurance.

Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said: "While there is no doubt that the Christmas period was a very different one for all of us, our officers continued to put the safety of our communities first.

"They conducted proactive patrols and worked closely with local businesses, licensed premises and our partners in public transport to deliver safer streets, safer roads and safer homes. This was in addition to their ongoing efforts to support the Health Protection Regulations and prevent the spread of Covid 19.

"I would like to thank all of those who worked with us, listened to our messaging and supported our efforts throughout Operation Season's Greetings.

"We will continue to work with all our partners, stakeholders and the public to build safer communities together."
