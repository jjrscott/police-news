Chief Constable George Hamilton said: "I welcome the explicit commitment to peace and the Rule of Law in todayâ€™s statement. I would also acknowledge the hard work of those in progressive loyalism and encourage them to continue their efforts to completely remove illegal paramilitary organisations from our communities."

"Twenty years on from the Peace Agreement it is disappointing that we are still in a place where there are statements about paramilitary violence and criminality."

"Our communities do not want to live in fear of violence. The Loyalist Community Council must support people in giving information to the police."

"There are no grey areas when it comes to the Rule of Law."

"Through the Paramilitary Crime Task Force, PSNI will continue to actively pursue and investigate those involved in violence and criminality and place them before the courts in order to protect society and keep people safe."
