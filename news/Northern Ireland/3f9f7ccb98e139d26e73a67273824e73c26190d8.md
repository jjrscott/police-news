Man arrested in investigation into 1987 police officer murders

A 54 year old man has been arrested in Belfast as part of enquiries into the murders of two police officers in the city 29 years ago.

Detective Constables Michael Malone (35) and Ernest Carson (50) were shot in an IRA gun attack at the Liverpool Bar in Donegall Quay on 26 August 1987. Another officer and a civilian were wounded.

Detective Inspector Stuart Griffin from Serious Crime Branch said: “The suspect is being questioned at a police station in Belfast. Although these murders happened a long time ago, police would continue to appeal to anyone with information about the shooting and those involved to come forward.”
