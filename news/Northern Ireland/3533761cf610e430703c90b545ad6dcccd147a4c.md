* Mid Ulster

Detectives are appealing for information following the discovery of a viable pipe-bomb type device in Banbridge this morning (Saturday 18th May).

Detective Inspector McCamley said: "We received a report around 1:15am of a suspicious object outside an address in Hawthorne Hill in the town.

"ATO attended and around 25 homes were evacuated while the object was examined. It has since been declared as viable and has been taken away for further forensic examination. All residents have now been allowed to return to their homes.

"Police would like to thank the local community for their patience while we worked to keep them safe. Keeping people safe is of paramount importance and we will not take any chances.

"I would appeal to anyone who noticed any suspicious activity in the area or anyone with any information that could help our investigation to contact detectives in Lurgan on 101, quoting reference number 81 of 18/05/19."

Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.
