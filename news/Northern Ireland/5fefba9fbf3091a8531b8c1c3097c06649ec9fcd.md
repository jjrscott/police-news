PSNI District Commander for Belfast Chief Supt Jonathan Roberts said, "Police are currently in attendance at the Henry Jones playing fields, on the Church Road in East Belfast. This follows a security alert at the facility last night when a telephoned warning indicated a number of devices had been left in the area. Police carried out a search of the area, based on the information received and nothing was found.

We now believe two on-going security alerts at Mayfield Square in the Blacks Road area of west Belfast and at Strandtown in east Belfast, are connected to last night's incident.

We are urging anyone who was training with East Belfast GAA club or anyone else who had a parked vehicle at the playing fields or surrounding area to check on and around their vehicle and report anything suspicious immediately to police"

We are keen to hear from witnesses of this incident

The Police Service of Northern Ireland is appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident or anyone with any information that will assist the investigation to contact us on the non-emergency number 101. Information can also be passed anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
