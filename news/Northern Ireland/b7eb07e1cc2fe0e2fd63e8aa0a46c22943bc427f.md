Cannabis worth £200,000 seized, Newtownabbey

Officers from Antrim and Newtownabbey District Support Team have seized cannabis plants, with an estimated street value of £14,000 following a search of a property in the Glenville Park area of Newtownabbey yesterday, Tuesday 20 September.

Chief Inspector Arthur Davidson said: “We are delighted to have been able to shut down this cannabis factory and prevent these drugs from being sold in our communities. The seizures are a great example of how easy it can be when the public report their suspicions to us.

“We are aware of the threat posed by illegal drugs and are determined to use every opportunity to take controlled drugs off the streets and bring anyone involved in their sale, supply or distribution before the courts.

"I would appeal to anyone who has any concerns or information about illegal drugs to contact their local Police on the non-emergency number 101. Or, if someone would prefer to provide information without giving their details they can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800 555 111."
