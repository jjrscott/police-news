ACC Martin welcomes findings of DOJ report

Assistant Chief Constable Stephen Martin welcomed the findings of the DOJ perceptions of Policing, Justice and Anti-social behaviour report released today and said;

“It is encouraging to see an increase in Confidence in the police compared with the same period in the previous year. This clearly demonstrates that we continue to deliver a service that the community have confidence in despite all the challenges and changes we have faced recently.

“The reality is that PSNI is a smaller organisation which means we have to understand and prioritise the demands from the public and continually strive to be more effective and efficient. This isn’t easy but this report shows that police officers and staff working hard on the ground with their local communities are making a real impact on people's lives.

“Our core purpose is Keeping People Safe and that will not change.”
