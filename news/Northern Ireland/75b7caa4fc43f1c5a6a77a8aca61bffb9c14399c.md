* Belfast

Detectives from the Paramilitary Crime Task Force have seized suspected cocaine with an estimated street value of £3000, suspected cannabis with an estimated street value of £8400 and approximately £4000 in cash, following proactive searches in the west Belfast area earlier today (Monday, September 28th).

A man and woman, both aged 28, were arrested on suspicion of a range of drugs offences and are currently in police custody.

Detective Inspector Hamilton said: "The PCTF will continue to proactively investigate suspected drug criminality linked to the INLA at every opportunity. Today's search and arrests are further evidence of our commitment to tackle drug criminality linked to paramilitaries and reduce the harm caused by drugs in the community.

"Drugs cause misery to users, their families and the wider community, and the proceeds of their sale are used to fund paramilitary activity.
Today's search provides further evidence to the community that; we care about what is important to them, we will listen to what they tell us and we act on the information they provide us. I would therefore encourage members of the community who may have information that could assist our efforts to tackle the blight of drugs, to please get in touch.
