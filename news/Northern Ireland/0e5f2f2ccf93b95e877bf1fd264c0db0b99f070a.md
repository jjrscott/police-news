60 year old Jonathan Lowry has been sentenced to 100 hours community service and given a two year probation order for making and possessing indecent images of children and possession of extreme pornography at Laganside Magistrates' court today (Friday, September 25th).

He will also be subject to a Sexual Offences Prevention Order for five years.

Detective Constable Jane Biggerstaff of the PSNI's Child Internet Protection Team said: "Children should be able to live their lives in total innocence, without a care in the world. However, there are people who choose to exploit and expose children to their dark, depraved underworld.

"Our message today is clear, we will not cease in their endeavour to catch those who exploit the most vulnerable in our society. This conviction should serve as a warning to those who think their own activity will go unnoticed or unpunished.

"Everyone leaves a digital footprint when downloading, viewing or making indecent images of children. We will be relentless in our pursuit of offenders and when we catch them the repercussions will be far reaching."
