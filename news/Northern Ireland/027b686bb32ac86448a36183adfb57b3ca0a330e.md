Detectives are investigating the report of a robbery at Shaw's Road in west Belfast earlier today Tuesday 15th September.

Detective Sergeant Sam McCallum said: "We received a report at around 8.30am this morning, that three men wearing balaclavas and dressed in dark clothing, approached a delivery van which was parked at the rear of a shop in the area."

"The first man was wearing a Black Jacket with red at the top of it, a black bucket hat, dark grey tracksuit bottoms and black and white trainers. The second was dressed in a black hoodie, black bucket hat, black tracksuit bottoms and trainers, and the third man was wearing black bucket hat, black jacket with a grey hoodie, black trousers and white shoes.

"The three men unloaded a large quantity of cigarettes from the delivery van into their vehicles - a small white van and a small black car which subsequently made off from the scene.

"The incident has also been linked to a further report of two burnt out vehicles in the Rosnareen area of West Belfast this morning.

"Detectives are appealing for anyone who may have been in the area and have any information or dashcam footage which may assist us with our inquiries to contact detectives at Musgrave on 101 quoting reference number 362 15/09/20. Information can also be given anonymously through the independent charity Crimestoppers on 101."
