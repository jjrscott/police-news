Detective Superintendent Richard Campbell, from the Police Service of Northern Ireland's Air Support Unit, said: "An aircraft from the Air Support Unit made an emergency landing last night (Thursday 12th) at The City of Derry Airport after experiencing engine failure while supporting District Policing colleagues who were dealing with a security alert in Limavady, which was later declared an elaborate hoax.

"The pilot and crew landed the plane safely without damage being caused and no injuries were sustained by those on board.

"The matter has now been referred to the Civil Aviation Authority and the Air Accidents Investigation Branch and we are fully co-operating with them as they work to establish the circumstances surrounding the engine failure."
