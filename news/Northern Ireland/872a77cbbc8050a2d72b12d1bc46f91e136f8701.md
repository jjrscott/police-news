Cannabis plants seized in south Belfast.

Detectives from PSNI Organised Crime are investigating the discovery of a suspected cannabis factory at a house in the Cairnshill Road area of south Belfast on Sunday 15th October.

Cannabis plants worth an estimated street value of approximately £75,000 were found inside the property in the Fourwinds area just after 6:15pm.

Detectives from Organised Crime, assisted by officers from the District Support Team, also found a quantity of cash inside the house.

Detective Inspector Pete Mullan said: “We are committed to tackling the issue of drugs and this discovery means we have interrupted the cultivation of cannabis and removed a significant quantity of drugs from sale.

“I would appeal to anyone with any information about the use or supply of illegal drugs to contact police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.”
