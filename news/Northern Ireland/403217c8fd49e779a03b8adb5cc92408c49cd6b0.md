* Lisburn & Castlereagh

Detectives are appealing for witnesses following a burglary of a house on Nettlehill Road in Lisburn last night.

It was reported that at around 8.30pm when a 60 year old female answered a knock to her door, 3 males forced their way into her home. One of the males forced the lady into the living room and held her down on the settee while the other two suspects searched the house. They made off with a small sum of cash and a mobile phone. The suspects were all described as wearing balaclavas. They are believed to have made off in a white or silver coloured family sized car.

Detective Sergeant McKimm said: â€œThis was a disgraceful and terrifying attack on a sixty year old lady in her own home. Whilst not physically injured she has been left extremely shaken by this horrific attack. The individuals who carried out this attack must be caught and I am appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time and who seen anything suspicious or who seen a silver or white car speed off from the area between 8.30pm and 9pm?
