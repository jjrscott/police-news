Police are appealing for information following an incident at Drumcree Road, Portadown, on Sunday 4th August.

Shortly after 1pm a silver coloured Seat Alhambra car struck a police officer and a member of the public who were in attendance at a parade in the area and made off without stopping. The car was abandoned a short time later at Churchill Park and witnesses reported seeing three men making off on foot from the car. Further reports have been received of the same car being driven dangerously through Portadown earlier in the day.

Inspector Brian Mills said: "Thankfully the officer and member of the public were not seriously injured but this incident could have been much worse. We are working to establish the identity of the driver of the car and I would ask anyone who can assist us with our enquiries to contact officers at Lurgan on 101 quoting reference number 1139 04/08/19. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime."
