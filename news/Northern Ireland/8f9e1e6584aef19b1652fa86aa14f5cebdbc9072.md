* Newry, Mourne & Down

Seven men today pleaded guilty to a range of offences, including a combined total of around 40 terrorist charges, at Belfast Crown Court.

The Head of PSNI's Serious Crime Branch, Detective Chief Superintendent Raymond Murray, said: "This is one of the most significant terrorism cases in recent times given the seriousness of the offences and the number of people involved.

"The men, who range in age from 36 to 65 years, were due to go on trial following a counter terrorism operation which was centred at a house at Ardcarn Park, Newry in 2014.

"Following today's guilty pleas, they will be sentenced in March, alongside an 8th man who pleaded guilty earlier this month.

"Today's result demonstrates our commitment to disrupting terrorism and protecting the community."
