Detectives are appealing for information following five burglaries in the Newry, Mourne and Down area earlier this week.

Homes in Warrenpoint, Rostrevor, Kilkeel and Mayobridge were targeted by thieves on 29 December.

Detective Sergeant James Johnston said: “Three males were disturbed in two burglaries, which occurred in Warrenpoint and Mayobridge on the evening of 29th December and may have been sighted at other locations in the areas of Kilkeel and Rostrevor that same evening.

We are investigating a possible link between these incidents and would like to hear from anyone with information. We are particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have noticed three males or any vehicles acting suspiciously in these areas on Friday 29 December. Please call 101, quoting reference number 991 29/12/17, should you have any information.”
