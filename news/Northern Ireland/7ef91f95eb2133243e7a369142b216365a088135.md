A 53 year old man from Omagh, County Tyrone, was sentenced at Dungannon Crown Court on Tuesday 28 May, having been found guilty of historic sex offences.

The man was sentenced to five years imprisonment and a following 2 years on probation. He will also be on the sex offender's register for life and is banned from working with vulnerable people and children.

Detective Chief Inspector Gary McDonald said: "I welcome the sentencing of this man for 22 historic sexual offences including a number of indecent assaults and gross indecency on a teenage boy and indecent assault on a woman.

"The offences dated back to the 1980s and I commend the courage of the victims in coming forward and seeking justice many years later. I would encourage anyone who has been sexually abused to come forward and report it to police, even if it was a long time ago. We have trained officers who will treat all victims with sensitivity and respect. This case shows that even if a number of years have passed, we can still investigate reports of sexual offences against children and place offenders before the courts so that justice can prevail."
