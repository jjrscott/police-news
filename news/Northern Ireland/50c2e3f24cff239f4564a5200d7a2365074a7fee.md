Detectives in Omagh are appealing for information following the report of a robbery of a cash in transit van at Tattymoyle Road in Fintona on Saturday 8th August.

Detective Sergeant Brian Reid said: "It was reported that just after 1pm this afternoon, a male wearing a Halloween type mask and armed with a suspected firearm, threatened a security operative as he approached an ATM machine and made off with a cash box. The male got into the passenger seat of a waiting black coloured VW Golf car, with partial registration DV08, and made off from the scene. The car was located on fire nearby at Barr Road a short time later. The security operative was left deeply shocked following the incident but was not physically injured.
