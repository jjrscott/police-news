Cookstown man sentenced for drugs offences

Police have welcomed a custodial sentence handed down to a Cookstown man for drug possession and supply offences.

Twenty seven year old James Doyle, with an address at Maloon Hill in the town, was convicted in February for possessing class B drugs, possessing class B drugs with intent to supply and possessing criminal property.

At Dungannon Crown Court this morning, he was sentenced to 18 months in custody and will spend a further 18 months on license.

Detective Inspector Will Tate said: “This was a result of a successful, proactive search operation led by officers from the Mid Ulster District Support Team, supported by detective colleagues in Reactive and Organised Crime, at Doyle’s Cookstown home in December 2014.

Almost £50,000 worth of herbal cannabis and £70,000 cash were seized from the property.

Police in Mid Ulster remain committed to tackling the issue of drug supply and distribution. We understand the harm drug sale, supply and use can cause within communities and we will continue to work with residents to identify those involved in the local illegal drugs trade and to hold them to account for their crimes.”
