Commenting on the publication of 'New Decade, New Approach' PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne said: "There is much in this document which is good for policing and I welcome its publication.

"Clearly the support for boosting the strength of the PSNI to 7,500 police officers will be at the heart of our aspiration to invest significantly in community policing across Northern Ireland in the months ahead.

"We welcome plans to reform and streamline our outdated criminal justice processes and also address the issue of legacy investigations which drain our focus on policing the issues of here and now."

Mr Byrne concluded, "A fresh emphasis on tackling the scourge of paramilitary crime and intimidation, supported by legislation to tackle unexplained wealth, sits four square with our operational priorities."
