Detectives investigate sexual assault, Kilkeel

Detectives are investigating a sexual assault on a woman in Kilkeel yesterday, Thursday, 21 July.

At approximately 5.30pm as the woman was walking in Mourne Park, a male grabbed her, pulled her to the ground and sexually assaulted her. The assailant is described as being in his early 30’s, 5’ 6” with dark eyes and swarthy skin. He was wearing a dark baseball cap and a blue top.

Detective Inspector Colin Patterson said: “We are appealing for witnesses and we are asking anyone who may have been in the park at around the time of the assault to get in touch with Police in Newry by calling 101, quoting reference number 991 21/07/16.

Alternatively, if someone would prefer to provide information without giving their details they can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800 555 111."
