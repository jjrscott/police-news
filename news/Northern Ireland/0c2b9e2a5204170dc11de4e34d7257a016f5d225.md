Detectives in Bangor have arrested four men following a hijacking in the town last night.

Detective Sergeant Miskelly said: “A man was in his Peugeot RCZ in a carpark in Bingham Lane at around 10pm when he was approached and ordered from his vehicle by a man armed with what’s thought to have been a handgun.

The hijacker then made of in the victim’s car, driving down a pedestrian walkway before colliding with a bollard. He then ran from the vehicle, accompanied by a number of other men who are said to have been running behind the car.

Officers investigating the report located and arrested four males a short time later. All remain in custody this morning.

Anyone who witnessed the hijacking or who has any information that could assist the investigation is asked to contact detectives by calling 101, quoting reference number 1332 20/09/18.”
