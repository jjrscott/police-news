Assistant Chief Constable Barbara Gray said: "Different groups representing a variety of causes gathered at a number of locations across Northern Ireland today (Saturday 13th June), which police attended.

"Due to the nature of the different protests and gatherings, community police continued to engage, explain and encourage people to comply with the Health Protection Regulations.

"No arrests were made, and no fines or Community Resolution Notices were issued today.

"However, we had a substantial evidence gathering operation in place, and evidence gathered will now be reviewed and we will work with our partners in the Public Prosecution Service as appropriate."
