Detectives in Musgrave are investigating a paramilitary style shooting in the Cavendish Street area of west Belfast last night, Saturday, 30th December.

Police received a report at a round 7:45pm that three males in dark clothing entered a house and struck a 28 year old man over the head before shooting him in both knees and his right ankle with a hand gun.

A female was assaulted and four young children who were in the house witnessed this horrific attack.

The victim was taken to hospital for treatment to his injuries, where he remains.

Detective Sergeant Kelly said: “This was a brutal attack in a busy residential area and yet another example of how criminal groups seek to control communities through fear and violence. The residents, including young children have been left terrified by these events.”

Detectives are keen to hear from anyone with information about this crime or anyone who may be able to help identify the perpetrators. Please contact Musgrave Criminal Investigation Branch on the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 1064 of 30/12/17.

Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.”
