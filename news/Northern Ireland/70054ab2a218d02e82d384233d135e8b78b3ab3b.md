Two arrested following Antrim altercation

Detectives are appealing for witnesses following an incident in Antrim yesterday, Saturday 13 May.

At around 7.30pm it was reported that two men, one of whom was armed with a knife, had confronted a 29 year old man in the Stiles Way area of the town

The pair then chased him through the housing estate and into a local fast food restaurant where staff intervened to allow him to hide in a back office until police arrived.

The arrested men, aged 18 and 44, were detained at the scene on suspicion of a number of assault and public order offences. They remain in custody at present.

Detective Sergeant Colin Gray said; “The police investigation is at a very early stage and we are still gathering information and speaking to a number of potential witnesses. I would encourage anyone who believes they can support this investigation to make contact with detectives in Antrim Reactive and Organised Crime by calling 101, quoting reference 1052 13/05/17.”
