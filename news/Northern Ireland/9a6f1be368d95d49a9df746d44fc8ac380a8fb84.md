Detectives from the Paramilitary Crime Task Force (PCTF) have seized suspected cocaine and cash during a operation at Belfast International Airport earlier today, Friday 25th September.

Detective Inspector Hamilton said: "These searches are part of a proactive operation into suspected drugs criminality liked to the INLA in Belfast. The searches are further evidence that PCTF are proactively investigating drugs criminality linked to paramilitaries. Two men and two women have been arrested on suspicion of possession of a class A drug, possession of class A drug with intent to supply and attempting to export class A Drugs. They are currently in custody.

"Today's operation shows the hypocrisy of these drug criminals who claim to be defenders of their communities, but in actual fact are destroying their own community by preying on vulnerable members of society and making a profit from the harm caused by illegal drugs. The PCTF will continue to robustly and proactively pursue those drug criminals who hide behind the guise of paramilitaries."

"We will continue to target those criminals who are involved in the sale and supply of illegal drugs and will continue to disrupt their activities at every opportunity. I would encourage members of the community who may have information that could assist our efforts, to please get in touch. We will listen to you and we will act on information you provide. You can call 101, or you can submit a report online using our non-emergency reporting form via http://www.psni.police.uk/makeareport/ .
