Detectives are appealing for information and witnesses following the report of an assault and robbery of a man on the Cliftonville Road area of north Belfast on Tuesday, April 30th.

Detective Sergeant Eric Fairfield said: "It is understood that at early on Tuesday afternoon, a man in his 20s was standing on the Cliftonville Road near the junction with Glenard Brook when he was struck on the side of the head by an unknown male with what is believed to have been a wheel brace.

"It was reported that the assailant picked up the man's mobile phone and ran off.

"The man is described as being in his 20s, around six feet tall, of stocky build. It is understood he was wearing a grey hooded top and grey shorts.

"The victim suffered a broken cheekbone and jaw as a result of this vicious attack.
