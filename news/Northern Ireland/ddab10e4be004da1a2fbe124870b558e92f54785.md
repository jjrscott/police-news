Warning issued over 'phone scam'

Police in Northern Ireland are warning the public about a phone scam by someone claiming to be from the Metropolitan Police.

The caller says he is carrying out an investigation and discusses the victim’s banking details. He then asks the victim to either transfer money or go to their bank and get money.

There have been a number of reports of this scam in the past few days and at least one victim has lost a substantial amount of money.

Detective Constable Stephen Crooks, from PSNI Economic Crime Unit, said: “Police will never ask anyone for banking details over the phone or to withdraw money. If they do, it’s a scam. If anyone gets a phone call like this, or knows of a vulnerable friend or relative who’s had one, they should contact police on the non-emergency number 101.”
