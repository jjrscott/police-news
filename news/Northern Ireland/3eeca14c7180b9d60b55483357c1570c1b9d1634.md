Cannabis factory uncovered - Victoria Road, Belfast

The PSNI’s Belfast Crime Support Team has uncovered a substantial cannabis factory in the east of the city.

Officers carried out a proactive search at a house on Victoria Road on Tuesday 10 May and discovered cannabis plants with an estimated value of around £85,000.

Detective Inspector White said: “During follow up searches this morning Wednesday 11 May, a 60 year old man was arrested at a property in Mersey Street in east Belfast. He was detained on suspicion of cultivating cannabis and other class B drugs offences. He remains in custody at this time assisting us with our enquiries.

Proactive search operations like this one demonstrate our ongoing commitment to tackling the scourge of drugs in our society. Anyone with information regarding the cultivation, sale and supply of drugs can contact police on 101. Or information can be given anonymously to the Crimestoppers charity on 0800 555 111.”
