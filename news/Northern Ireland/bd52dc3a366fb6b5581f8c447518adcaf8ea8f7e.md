* Belfast

Detectives are investigating an armed robbery in Belfast last night (Wednesday, 1st July).

Police received a call just before 11:40pm that a taxi driver, who had picked up a male customer on Great Victoria Street and drove him to Malcolmson Street, had been threatened at knife point.

It was reported that when the male customer got out of the car, he walked around to the driver's side where he produced what was described a butcher's knife and demanded money from the driver.

The suspect, who fled with a sum of money and made off towards Waterford Street, is described as approximately 20 years old, 5' 3'' tall and wore grey tracksuit bottoms and a red hooded top.

Detective Sergeant Hollie McCartan said: "This was a distressing ordeal for the victim, who was simply doing their job when this despicable attack occurred. I would appeal to anyone who may have been in the area last night and witnessed what occurred, or anyone who has information about this to call detectives at Musgrave on 101, quoting reference number 2198 of 01/07/20."
