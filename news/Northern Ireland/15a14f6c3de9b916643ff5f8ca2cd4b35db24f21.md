* Derry City & Strabane

Police in Derry/Londonderry are appealing for witnesses and information following the report of a hate incident that occurred in the Ballymagroarty area of the city on Wednesday, October 24.

Constable Lynn said: “We received a report around 9.50am yesterday (Thursday, October 25) that sometime between 9.30 pm and 10.00pm on Wednesday night, a man out walking a dog in the Ringford Road area, near a local school, was shouted at by a group of youths who followed him up the road.

“At this time, we are treating this as a homophobic hate incident and our enquiries are continuing.

"We are appealing to anyone who was in the Ringfort Road area around this time and saw what happened or anyone who can help us identify those involved to get in touch on the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 301 of 25/10/2018.

“Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.”
