Anti-Internment Parade passes off peacefully: ACC Stephen Martin

Speaking following today’s Anti-Internment League parade, Assistant Chief Constable Stephen Martin said: “I am pleased that the parade passed off peacefully.

“As in previous years, the foremost consideration of my officers today was to keep people safe and ensure that the parade passed off peacefully and within the law, that the rights of all those involved were protected and that the Parade’s Commission determination was upheld.

“While an appropriate and proportionate policing operation was put in place for these reasons, once the parade had dispersed, the area quickly returned to normal and all roads were re-opened.

“I would also like to thank Belfast’s District Commander Chief Superintendent Chris Noble and all the officers and staff involved in today’s policing operation. They did a professional job ensuring that the law was upheld, public safety was maintained and community disruption was kept to a minimum.”
