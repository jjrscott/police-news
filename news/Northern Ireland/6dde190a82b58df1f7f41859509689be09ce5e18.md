PSNI issue warning to Business and Industry following extortion demands by online criminal group

The PSNI Cyber Crime Centre are advising business and industry across Northern Ireland to be vigilant due to ongoing extortion demands being made against a number of companies by a known online criminal group.

Detective Chief Inspector Douglas Grant, Cyber Crime Centre said: "The ransom demands to date have carried the threat of a cyber attack being inflicted on the company and this attack may take the form of a DDOS attack (Distributed Denial of Service) which may disrupt or shut down company web services or networks.

"PSNI, working with partner agencies, are investigating these threats and we would like to provide the following advice to any company who is targeted:

1\. Report the incident to PSNI (101 or via the PSNI Cyber Incident Reporting Portal on the PSNI Website)

2\. Preserve any email communications (including email headers)

3\. Record the date, time and details of any communications or network activity

4\. Do not pay any ransom."

We are keen to hear from witnesses of this incident

The Police Service of Northern Ireland is appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident or anyone with any information that will assist the investigation to contact us on the non-emergency number 101. Information can also be passed anonymously via the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
