Don’t drink and drive

Police made 61 arrests for driving whilst under the influence of drink or drugs over the Easter period (Good Friday to Easter Monday) last year.

Don’t be part of those statistics this year.

Assistant Chief Constable Barbara Gray said: “We make no excuse for enforcing the law to make Northern Ireland’s roads safer. All road users must share the responsibility to prevent deaths and injuries on our roads.

“All I am asking over the Easter period is that drivers slow down, do not drive after drinking or taking drugs, wear a seatbelt, drive with greater care and attention and don’t use mobile phones while driving.”
