* Derry City & Strabane

Police investigating a fatal road traffic collision near Claudy in the early hours of Saturday 18 August are making a fresh appeal for information.

Constable Joanne Boyd said: “Mr Eamon McCafferty (58) was a pedestrian who was struck by a blue Hyundai I10 on the Foreglen Road around 2am that Saturday.

“We are appealing to the occupant(s) of a white-coloured Audi A4 which was travelling on the Foreglen Road from the direction of Dungiven towards Claudy between 1.55am and 2.10am to contact us as we believe they may have seen Mr McCafferty / the blue Hyundai car prior to the collision.

“We would also ask drivers who have dashcam fitted in their cars or motorcyclists with helmet cameras who may have been on this road at the time of the collision to get in touch with us on 101, quoting reference 154 of 18/08/18."
