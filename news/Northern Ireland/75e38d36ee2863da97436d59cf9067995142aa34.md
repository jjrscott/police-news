Chief Constable visits Washington ahead of St Patrick's Day

PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton and NI Policing Board (NIPB) Chair Anne Connolly will attend a series of engagements in Washington this week.

In addition to a scheduled programme of activity for St. Patrick’s Day in Washington, meetings, briefings and engagements have been arranged with a range of political representatives, key opinion formers and policing organisations.

Commenting on the visit George Hamilton said, “The PSNI and the NIPB have benefitted from the interest and support of US stakeholders including policing colleagues, politicians and academics over recent years. It is important that we continue to develop these relationships and in the days ahead will be sharing learning and experience from policing in Northern Ireland with policing and criminal justice agencies in the US.”

Speaking about the visit Policing Board Chair Anne Connolly said: “Policing continues to be an important area of interest in the US and this visit will provide opportunities to share the progress of delivering policing reform in Northern Ireland. It will also enable the Board and PSNI to build on already established relationships within the US policing and criminal justice arena.”
