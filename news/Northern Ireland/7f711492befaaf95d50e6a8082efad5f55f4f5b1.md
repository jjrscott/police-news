Man arrested on suspicion of Michael McGibbon murder

Detectives investigating the murder of Michael McGibbon in north Belfast have arrested a 34 year old man.

Detective Superintendent John McVea said: "The male has been detained on suspicion of murder. He will be questioned at Musgrave police station in Belfast."

33 year old Mr McGibbon was shot a number of times in an alleyway in Butler Place just after 10pm on Friday night, 15 April.

He was taken to hospital but later died from his injuries.

Detective Superintendent McVea has said that the murder bore all the hallmarks of a paramilitary murder: "Those who carried out this killing have no legitimacy in this community.

What happened in that alleyway robbed a family of a treasured husband and father. There is nothing that can justify or explain the senselessness of this murder.

I continue to appeal to the community for help in finding the people responsible. Help us bring justice to the McGibbon family."

The investigation team can be contacted at the Incident Room at Ladas Drive by calling 028 90700303.

Or if someone would prefer to provide information without giving their name they can phone the Crimestoppers charity anonymously on 0800 555 111.
