Police searching to find 14-year old Noah Donohoe have updated their appeal for information.

Superintendent Muir Clark said: "We know that Noah left his home in South Belfast on Sunday 21 June at approximately 5.30pm on his black Apollo mountain bike.

"Despite a significant search operation involving local and specialist officers, specialist police dogs, our air support unit, assistance from community search and rescue colleagues and the public, there have been no further confirmed sightings of Noah since 6.11pm on Sunday."

"We know that Noah cycled into Northwood Road where he abandoned all his clothing, as he is seen a short time later cycling while naked. We believe Noah then dropped his bicycle and left the area on foot.

"I can confirm that we have recovered Noah's Black crash helmet, blue Nike trainers with yellow tick, blue tie-die hoody, bicycle, and mobile phone.

"We have not yet found his khaki green North Face coat, grey sweat shorts and a green backpack containing a Lenovo laptop and a copy of the book, "12 Rules for Life" by Jordan B. Peterson.

"We need to find these outstanding items. If anyone has found any of these items and not yet come forward, please call us immediately.

"I would like to thank everyone who has contacted police so far with information. We have received and discounted a number of potential sightings. We have received a significant amount of dashcam and CCTV footage which we are currently reviewing. We have also checked items of clothing which have been found in the area, but so far, none of the items have been identified as Noah's.

"I want to pay particular tribute to all the people across North Belfast who have assisted with the search to date, and for those people who have allowed us to check through their properties.

"I appreciate everyone wants to help, but I now need the public to give both police and our Community Search and Rescue colleagues some space to ensure we have covered every possible area.

"To date, we have deployed specialist police search teams; our Tactical Support Group, Dogs, and Confined Spaces , police helicopters, civilian search and rescue drones as well as trained voluntary search and rescue assets.

"So far we have searched the area of Linear Park, Northwood Road, Premier Park, Seabank, Seapark, Seagrove, Seaview, Alexander Park, and Noah's school, St Malachys. We have also searched open areas and public spaces within the area.

We continue to ask members of the public to check their own premises, out buildings, sheds and other places of responsibility. If anyone would like assistance from police in searching in the immediate area of their homes or premises please contact us on 101.

 "I again appeal directly to Noah if you are watching this on the TV or listening on the Radio, or seeing this appeal online, you are not in any trouble. Just call us, let us know that you are safe and we will come to you.

"Again, if any of Noah's friends know anything that might help us to find him, you are not in any trouble. Just call us on 101 and let us know.

"Noah's family and police are very concerned for Noah as this is completely out of character.

"We need help from the public to find him. If you have any information please contact police immediately on 101 quoting reference number 1619 of 21/06/20."
