Police are appealing for witnesses following the report of a hit and run road traffic collision at the Donaghadee Road roundabout in Bangor on Sunday morning.

At approximately 9.30 am, a male cyclist in his 40s was cycling on the Donaghadee Road Roundabout and was hit by what is believed to have been a blue Vauxhall Corsa.

The driver of the car did not stop at the scene.

The cyclist was taken to hospital for treatment of their injuries which are not believed to have been life threatening.

Constable Cormac Dunlop said: "We would appeal for anyone who witnessed the collision or who may have captured footage on dashcam to contact officers on 101 quoting reference number 593 of 27/10/19. We are also keen to speak to another cyclist who had stopped at the scene to assist the injured cyclist before leaving."

Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.
