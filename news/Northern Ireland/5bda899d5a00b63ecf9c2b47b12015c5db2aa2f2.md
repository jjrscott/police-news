Detectives have arrested a 50 year old man following an incident at a property in Saint Patrick's Terrace in Omagh last night, Saturday 1 February.

Detective Sergeant Robinson said: "At around 10.25pm it was reported that a man armed with a bat had attacked the house, shouted racial slurs and attempted to force his way past the 34 year old male occupant to get inside the property.

A 22 year old woman and 3 year old boy who were inside the home were so in fear that they jumped from a first floor window to try to get away. As a result the woman has sustained pelvic injuries that will require surgery. The child was not harmed.

The suspect in custody was arrested at the scene and remains in police custody at present.

We are treating this incident as a hate crime and I am appealing for witnesses. Hate crime has no place in society and should be rejected and reviled by everyone. If you can help our investigation, please get in touch by calling 101, quoting reference 1876 01/02/20."
