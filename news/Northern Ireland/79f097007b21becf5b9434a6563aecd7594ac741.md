Police welcome jail term for man shining laser at PSNI helicopter

Police have welcomed the 6 month jail term imposed on a 35 year old Greenisland man for shining a laser at a PSNI helicopter.

This sends out a very clear message to anyone engaging in this type of behaviour. This will not be tolerated. If anyone is found to be using a laser pen in this way they will be rigorously pursued and taken through the courts. By shining a laser pen at an aircraft people are not only putting the lives of the pilot and passengers in danger but also the people below on the ground. We are fortunate that no one was seriously injured in this incident.

If anyone witnesses this type of behaviour we would ask them to contact Police on the non-emergency number 101. Or, if someone would prefer to provide information without giving their details they can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800 555 111.
