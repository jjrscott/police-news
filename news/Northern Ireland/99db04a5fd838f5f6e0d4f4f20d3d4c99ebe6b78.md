Detectives, alongside officers from the local Neighbourhood Policing Team conducted a search of a property in the Newry area this morning (Wednesday 3rd March).

Detective Constable McGaffin said: "A proactive policing operation was conducted at a house in the Newry area, as part of the ongoing investigation following a burglary which occurred at the Keery Road area of Bready on Tuesday 19th May 2020. During the search operation, an engagement ring was recovered from the property believed to have been taken during the burglary last year. A mobile phone was also seized and taken away for further forensic examination.

"It is extremely pleasing to be able to reunite the owner with her possession. An engagement ring is an extremely personal and sentimental item, and the owner was delighted with this outcome.
