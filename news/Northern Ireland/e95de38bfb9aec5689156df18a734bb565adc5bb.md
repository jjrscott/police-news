Detectives investigating a serious assault on a man in Larne last night (Monday 15th June) are appealing for witnesses and information.

A report was made to police at approximately 9:25pm that a man had been attacked by three masked men with baseball bats in an alleyway in the vicinity of Churchill Road.

The victim, aged in his twenties, crawled to an address on Churchill Road where he sought help. Police responded and took the man to hospital for treatment of injuries to his ankles and arm.

The perpetrators are described as wearing dark-coloured clothing.
