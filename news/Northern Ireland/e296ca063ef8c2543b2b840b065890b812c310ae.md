* Belfast

Police in South Belfast have issued 47 Covid notices and nine prohibition notices over the last two nights as part of their ongoing operation to address antisocial and criminal activity in the Holyland area of South Belfast.

A 16 year old male was also arrested on Saturday, 19th September, for possession of Class B drugs and possession of Class B drugs with intent to supply. He was later released on bail pending further enquiries.

During patrols of the Stranmillis area, an additional 24 Covid notices and four prohibition notices were issued over Friday and Saturday night.

Chief Inspector Gavin Kirkpatrick said, "It is disappointing and frustrating that once again we need to remind people of the importance of following the clear and

specific advice, guidance and warnings issued by ourselves, the Health Minister, Universities and others.

"Our robust policing operation will continue over the coming days with our partner agencies, including representatives from Belfast City Council and both universities.

"If you have moved to the Holyland area or are visiting the area, you must adhere to the Health Protection Regulations to protect yourselves and others from Covid19."
