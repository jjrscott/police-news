* Antrim & Newtownabbey

Detectives from The Police Service's Major Investigation Team have confirmed the identity of two women who were murdered in Newtownabbey on Friday 19 March.

Detective Chief Inspector John Caldwell said: "I can confirm the identities of the two women who were murdered were Karen McClean, 50 and Stacey Knell who was 30 years old. This was a really shocking and horrific double murder of two women inside their own homes. A place where they should have been safe. My thoughts are very much with their families as they come to terms with their tragic loss. Both women were mothers and this appalling murder has left children facing a lifetime without their mums.

"Just after 10.55pm on Friday evening, police received a report of a stabbing at a residential property in the Derrycoole Way area. Officers attended, along with colleagues from NIAS and sadly, a woman was pronounced dead. Officers then attended a residential property in the Glenville Road area where a second woman was found dead. An unconscious man was also found inside the property who subsequently died. He was 26 year old Kenneth Flanagan.

"I am not looking for anyone else in connection with the murders which I believe are connected.

"We would urge anyone with any information which may assist our investigation to contact 101 and quote reference number 2441 of 19/03/21."
