Man shot in leg: Drumcree, Cookstown

Detectives in Cookstown are investigating a shooting incident in the town on Sunday 5 June.

At around 5.40pm two men wearing balaclavas and camouflage jackets entered a house in Drumcree

The intruders, one of whom was armed with a handgun, threatened the occupants before shooting a 35 year old male once in the leg.

He is understood to be in a stable condition in hospital.

A woman in her thirties and another male, also in his thirties, were in the house at the time. They were not injured.

Detective Inspector Will Tate said: “Incredibly this incident occurred in a busy residential area during daylight hours. We believe those responsible may well have been spotted by local people both as they approached the property and as they made their escape from the area on foot.

We are keen to hear from witnesses or anyone with any other information about this crime. The number to call is 101.”

If someone would like to provide information without giving their name, they can contact the Crimestoppers charity anonymously on 0800 555 111.
