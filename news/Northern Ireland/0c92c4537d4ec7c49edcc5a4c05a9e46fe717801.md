Malicious Calls to Schools Across Northern Ireland

Seven primary schools were targeted in a series of hoax bomb calls this morning.

Temporary Chief Superintendent Simon Walls said: “PSNI are investigating a series of malicious communications to schools across Northern Ireland today.

At this stage there is no information to suggest the incidents are terrorist-related.

Enquiries continue to establish the facts. We will liaise with other UK Police services, who have received similar calls yesterday, to investigate who is responsible and whether these incidents are linked.

Anyone with information should contact police on the non-emergency number 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.”
