Detectives from PSNIs Serious Crime Branch have launched a murder investigation following the death of a man in North Belfast last night Thursday 28 June.

Police received a report from the Ambulance Service just after 9pm that they were attending to a seriously injured male who they had located in the area of Parkmount Street / Seaview Close.

The man, aged 30, was treated at the scene by paramedics before being taken to hospital where he unfortunately died from his injuries.

Detective Chief Inspector Pete Montgomery said: “A 21 year old male has been arrested on suspicion of murder and have been taken to Musgrave Police Station for questioning.
