Firearms Banded System - Introduction of interim telephone number

Following the Department of Justice changes in May 2016 in relation to one-on one-off Banded transactions for firearms, the Firearms and Explosives Branch of the Police Service have introduced an interim telephone line to help members of the public with their transactions.

Nichola Murphy, Head of Firearms and Explosives Branch explains: “We have been working with our key stakeholders and have introduced an interim telephone number for up to three months. This will allow members of the public to phone in between 10am – 3pm Monday to Friday, give their details (as per the online system) and they will be provided with a transaction ID number. This interim arrangement will provide people with some assistance as the new system becomes established and also allows us to assess progress.

“Members of the public who do not have access to a computer to complete their transaction can now call the non-emergency 101 number and ask to be put through to extension 23098 where we will have staff that will process their banded system.” In order to process this transaction the applicant will need the following details:

• Dealers Name

• Applicants Contact Number

• Applicants Email Address

• Applicants Firearms Certificate number

• Serial Number of the firearm you wish to give up

• Debit or Credit Card details

Each transaction will cost £15
