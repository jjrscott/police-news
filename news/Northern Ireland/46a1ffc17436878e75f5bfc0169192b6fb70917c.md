* Belfast

The Police Service of Northern Ireland has applied for the temporary closure of a number of off-licenses in South Belfast on Wednesday, 12 July.

Superintendent Robert Murdie explained: “In line with our policing with the community priorities, we have spoken with each of the owners and managers of off-licenses in the Bradbury Place area and they have voluntarily agreed to limit opening hours on 12 July. We welcome the support and social responsibility shown by these off-licenses and recognise their contribution to making the area safer for all those attending the Twelfth celebrations.

“In recent years police have dealt with various incidents in which alcohol may have played a part. While the majority of people will be out to enjoy the parades in the City, overindulgence in alcohol can lead some people to act in a way they would never do when sober. This can lead to assaults, damage to property and annoyance to others. Such behaviour is not acceptable.

“We will be working alongside Belfast City Council and will be planning joint enforcement patrols with Belfast City Council’s Antisocial Behaviour Officers to seize alcohol from anyone drinking in the street and to minimise antisocial behaviour in general.”
