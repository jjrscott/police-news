* Belfast

Detectives from PSNI Organised Crime Unit have seized a quantity of suspected class A drugs and arrested two people following the search of a house in north Belfast on Wednesday 20th June.

Detective Chief Inspector David Henderson said: “The search was carried out today at a house on the Ardoyne Road and followed the recent interception of a parcel from the postal system containing approximately £20k of suspected cocaine. A further quantity of suspected cocaine, thought to be worth around £25k, was located at the house today. A woman aged 54 and a man aged 22 were arrested at the scene on suspicion of a number of drugs related offences and are currently in custody assisting us with our enquiries.”

“Tackling the illegal supply and use of drugs is a priority for police and seizures such as this demonstrate our ongoing commitment to tackling the scourge of drugs in our society. I would encourage anyone who has any information about the use or supply of illegal drugs to contact police on the non-emergency number 101 with any information they have. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.”
