Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said: "Yesterday we confirmed that eight of our officers had tested positive for COVID -19. This number has not increased.

"However, the number of officers who are currently self-isolating and undergoing testing for Covid-19 has increased from 51 yesterday to 60 officers today.

"In line the with public health guidance, we are taking all appropriate steps to address and manage the issue. While we hope to return frontline officers to their duties in the coming days, our officers' health and welfare is of paramount importance and we will ensure they return to duty when it is safe to do so.

"In the meantime, both Antrim and Newtownabbey stations will remain closed to the public, until further notice. This will be kept under constant review.

"Once again, I would like to reassure the public we have appropriate plans in place across the District to provide a service to the community and keep people safe."
