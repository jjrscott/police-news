Detectives are investigating the report of a robbery in Cookstown last night (Thursday, 4th March).

Police received a report shortly before 9:45pm that a masked man had entered commercial premises on Chapel Street at around 9:35pm and threatened staff, demanding money. The suspect made his way around the counter and forced the till drawer open, snatching a sum of money and then fleeing.

The suspect is described as having spoken with a local accent, of thin build and wore a white face mask, a dark-coloured hooded top with grey sleeves from the elbow down, dark-coloured bottoms and dark trainers.

Detective Inspector Kelly said: "While there were no injuries reported, this was a distressing ordeal for the staff member who was in their place of work simply doing their job. Understandably, this was a frightening experience.

"Our investigation continues, and we would ask anyone with information about this incident to call our detectives on 101, and quote reference number 1921 of 04/03/21."

A report can also be submitted via http://www.psni.police.uk/makeareport/ or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
