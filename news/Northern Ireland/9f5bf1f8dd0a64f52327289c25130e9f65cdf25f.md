Police investigating a number of burglaries in North Belfast last night (Tuesday 21 January), have arrested a 24 year old man on suspicion of burglary, aggravated burglary and a number of motoring offences.

Inspector Tony Frazer said: "Police received reports of three burglaries in the area of Grays Lane, North Belfast. During one of the burglaries the occupants were threatened with a kitchen knife. A silver Hyundai IX20 was stolen during one of the burglaries, which subsequently collided with a parked vehicle just off the Cavehill Road and the driver made off from the scene."

We are appealing for anyone who was in the area of Grays Lane or the Cavehill Road late last night or during the early hours of this morning and who observed the movements of the Silver coloured Hyundai IX20 or who witnessed any of the incidents to contact Police at Tennent Street station on 101 quoting reference 50 22/01/20. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.
