Detectives are appealing for witnesses following the report of two males being assaulted in the Boyd Street area of Belfast on Sunday evening.

Detective Inspector Carol Dane said: "It was reported to police at around 7.00 pm that two men armed with a knife and a gun, forced entry to a property in the Boyd Street area.

"A short time later a number of males arrived in the area in a white Ford Kuga and assaulted the men with iron bars. Two men aged 35 and 32 were taken to hospital for treatment of their injuries, they were later arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary and possession of a firearm.

"We are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the assault or may have seen the white Ford Kuga around that time, to contact detectives at Musgrave on 101 quoting reference 1210 of 07/04/19."

Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.
