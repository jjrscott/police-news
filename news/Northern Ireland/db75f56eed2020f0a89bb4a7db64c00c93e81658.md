* Belfast

Police are appealing for witnesses to an altercation in Belfast City Centre last night, Saturday 18 January, during which three men sustained stab wounds.

It's understood the three, aged 23, 29 and 38, were involved in a fight in the Great Northern Mall on Great Victoria Street at around 7.15pm.

One man was found by police at the scene and the other two of the men made their way from the area and onto the Dublin Road where they were subsequently located.

All three men were treated for non-life threatening injuries and arrested on suspicion of a number of offences including causing grievous bodily harm with intent. They have been released on bail pending further enquiries.

Inspector Jamie Hughes said: "At this time we believe that only the three men in custody were involved in this incident however we would like to speak to anyone who witnessed what happened. Great Victoria Street and the Dublin Road would have been busy at the time and we are certain that a number of people would have seen the altercation unfold and may not yet have spoken to police. We would like to hear from anyone who was in the area at around 7.15pm or anyone who captured mobile phone or dashcam footage. Please call 101, quoting reference 1549 18/0120.
