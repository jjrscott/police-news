Detectives from PSNI Major Investigation Team are investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of a woman in east Belfast.

Detective Chief Inspector Eamonn Corrigan said: "The body of a 53-year-old woman was discovered in a property in Whincroft Way late on Sunday night, 10 March. A post-mortem examination will take place in due course but I am treating her death as murder at this time.

A 42-year-old male has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody.

I am appealing for anyone who was in the area of Whincroft Way yesterday and who witnessed anything or anyone with any information that can assist my investigation contact Detectives on 101 quoting reference 1345 10/03/19."

Alternatively information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime."
