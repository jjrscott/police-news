Woman charged with fraud offences: County Tyrone

Detectives from the PSNI Economic Crime Unit have charged a 41 year old woman with a number of fraud offences.

Detective Chief Inspector Ian Wilson said: "An investigation was conducted after a Tyrone manufacturing company contacted police and expressed concerns about its accounts.

A woman was arrested in Fivemiletown last month. After a series of interviews, she has been charged to appear at Dungannon Magistrates Court on 1 July with fraud by abuse of position, concealing criminal property and making, having and supplying articles for use in fraud."

As is usual procedure the charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.

Enquiries indicate the amount involved runs into seven figures.
