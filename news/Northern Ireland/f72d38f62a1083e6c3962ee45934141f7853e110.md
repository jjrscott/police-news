* Belfast

Officers from the Paramilitary Crime Task Force investigating the criminal activities linked to East Belfast UVF have seized a quantity of suspected class A and C controlled drugs and approximately Â£5000 in cash following a search in east Belfast this evening (Friday, March 27th).

Detective Inspector Hamilton said: "Today's operation proves our continued determination to disrupt the criminality activity of organised criminals who badge themselves as paramilitaries and is another step in our ongoing commitment to preventing dangerous drugs from ending up in local communities.

"The drugs and cash seized today highlights the continuing hypocrisy of those who claim to be protecting the community, while in fact they are actually causing it harm.

"We will continue to listen to the community and act on information provided, so I would encourage anyone with information about the supply of illegal drugs or information about paramilitary organised crime to get in touch with police on 101.

"Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime."

The Police Service of Northern Ireland, HM Revenue & Customs and the National Crime Agency have established the Paramilitary Crime Task Force to tackle criminality linked to paramilitarism as part of the Executive's action plan on tackling paramilitary activity, criminality and organised crime.
