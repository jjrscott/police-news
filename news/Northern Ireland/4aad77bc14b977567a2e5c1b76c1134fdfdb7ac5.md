* Belfast

Detectives are investigating an attempt to steal a vehicle in the Ireton Street area of south Belfast last night, Friday 6 September.

Shortly before 7.30pm the vehicle owner saw two men attempting to steal his Honda Civic. When confronted, one of the suspects swung a wheel lock at the car owner. A number of people then also intervened to try to stop the pair making off with the vehicle. In the ensuing scuffle the victim sustained a cut to his hand, believed to have been caused by a stanley knife.

The would-be thieves then fled on foot in the direction of Wolseley Street where it's believed they may have gotten into a silver coloured car.

Anyone who can help detectives identify these suspects or who captured footage of them is asked to contact CID at Musgrave Police Station by calling 101, quoting reference 1929 06/09/19.
