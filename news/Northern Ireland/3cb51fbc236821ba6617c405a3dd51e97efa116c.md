Detectives are investigating an arson attack in Moneymore early this morning, Monday 29 April.

A car parked outside a house in Conyngham Street was deliberately set alight at around 3.30am. The blaze destroyed the vehicle and also caused fire damage to the property. A couple and their three children who were inside at the time were not hurt.

Detective Sergeant Robinson said: "We are working to establish a motive for this attack and would like to hear from anyone with information. Detectives can be contacted at Mid Ulster CID offices, Coostown by calling 101, quoting reference 149 29/04/19."

Alternatively information can be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.
