Chief Constable Simon Byrne has today, Monday 19th October issued details of a three-month pilot for a proposed new uniform.

The Chief Constable explained: "From today, you may see officers in some areas wearing a different style of uniform. 150 officers from a range of operational positions and locations are taking part in a three-month trial.

"The current uniform has been in existence since the formation of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, and, as a consequence, it is right that we should look at how effective it is almost 20 years on.

"It is important that we equip our frontline officers with professional, modern workwear, which is fit for purpose, that's why we are reviewing how our uniform remains practical and comfortable, in support of our officers as they perform their duties. In developing the new uniform options we have listened to feedback from frontline officers and the Police Federation.

"Our officers work at the heart of communities and, therefore it is also fitting that we listen to what communities think during the pilot phase.

"As part of the pilot, we will also be working with Policing and Community Safety Partnerships to host a number of engagement events across Northern Ireland and engaging with a number of key internal and external stakeholders."
