Aggravated burglary - south Belfast

Detectives are investigating an aggravated burglary at a house in south Belfast this morning, Saturday 19 March.

Detective Constable Erica Mooney, from Musgrave Reactive and Organised Crime, explains: “A 26 year old man was in the living room of his Melrose Street home at around 11am this morning when three men burst in.

The intruders, two of whom are believed to have been armed with a crowbar and a screwdriver, ordered the resident to place a pillow over his face while they ransacked the property.

The men left with a laptop.

We are keen to hear from witnesses or anyone with information about this crime. The number to call is 101. Alternatively information can be given anonymously via the Crimestoppers charity on 0800 555 111.”
