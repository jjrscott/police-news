Following the seizure of cocaine with an estimated street value of over £1.2 million by NCA on February 22nd, Detective Chief Superintendent John McVea said: "We are delighted with the success of our Law Enforcement colleagues. More importantly we are pleased with the positive impact this will have for individuals and communities within Northern Ireland in terms of disrupting the distribution and supply of Class A drugs and bringing those harmful offenders to justice. Anything we can do to support a collective effort across a range of partners, as was seen in yesterday's operation, is always welcomed, as well as the fact that cocaine with an estimated street value of over £1.2 million has been taken out of the control of criminals."
