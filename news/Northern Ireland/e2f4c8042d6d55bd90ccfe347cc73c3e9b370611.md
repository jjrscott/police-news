Man charged with murder of Paul McCauley

Detectives investigating the murder of Paul McCauley in Derry in 2006 have charged two men with a number of offences.

A 28 year old man has been charged with murder, Grievous Bodily Harm and Attempted Grievous Bodily Harm. He will appear at Londonderry Magistrates Court tomorrow morning.

A 61 year old man arrested in England yesterday has been charged with withholding information. He will appear at Londonderry Court on 4 May.

A 27 year old man also being questioned has been released on bail pending a report being submitted to the Public Prosecution Service.

Detective Chief Inspector Michael Harvey, from Serious Crime Branch, said: “Our enquiries are ongoing and we continue to appeal to anyone with information about the events in Chapel Road on 15 July 2006 and their aftermath to come forward and talk to us.”

38 year old Paul died last June in a care facility almost nine years after the attack. One man has already been charged with Paul’s murder and another reported to the PPS.
