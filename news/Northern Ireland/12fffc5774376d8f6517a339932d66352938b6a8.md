Chief Constable extends sympathies on the death of Martin McGuinness

Chief Constable George Hamilton said: "I was saddened to hear of the death of former Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness. I extend the sympathies of the Police Service to his wife and family at this sad time.

"Our society suffered grievously throughout our troubled history; and many police officers and their families are among those who suffered.

"But Martin McGuinness believed in a better future for our community; and this is a vision shared by policing.

"Martinâ€™s journey in life challenges all of us who care about the future; to be prepared to change; to demonstrate leadership; and to work to understand the world, not just from our own perspective, but from the perspectives of everyone in our community."
