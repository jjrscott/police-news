Detectives from the PSNI's Criminal Investigation Branch have today (Wednesday 24th March) arrested a man and carried out three searches in the Newry area as part of Operation Venetic.

Detective Inspector McCamley said: "Detectives from Criminal Investigation Branch's Organised Crime Unit continue to play their part in the UK's biggest law enforcement operation against serious and organised criminality. As part of this, officers carried out a search of three properties in the Newry area today.

"Detectives seized a quantity of cash in excess of £10,000, one vehicle and several pallets of wine valued at approximately £30,000 on behalf of HMRC who will carry out an investigation in respect of potential evasion of excise duty.

"A 47 year old man was arrested as part of the operation for Entering into an Arrangement to Acquire Criminal Property. He has been taken to custody where he is being questioned by detectives.

"This is an example of our ongoing commitment to bring those involved in criminal activity to justice. Working alongside our partner agencies, we will continue to disrupt the movements and activities of Organised Crime Gangs. We recognise the harm caused in our communities as a result of organised crime and we will continue to keep people safe from this activity.
