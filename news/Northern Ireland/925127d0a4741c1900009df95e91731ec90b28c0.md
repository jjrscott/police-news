Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said: “In August we advised the public that the Risk Avoidance and Danger Awareness Resource (RADAR) was to close in December due to budgetary pressures and other factors. At the time we also said that we would continue to work with Government Departments and key stakeholders to explore any further options to keep the Centre open.

“Over the past number of months we have been working closely with our colleagues in the Department of Justice and the Department of Finance and others, and I am pleased to say that we have secured both funding and lease arrangements for a further 12 months which will in turn allow us time to develop a sustainable future for the Centre.

“I have met with the staff of the Centre and advised them of this development.

“I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who have worked to make today’s announcement possible and look forward to continuing to work with them to secure the future of this wonderful and valuable facility.

“The RADAR Centre remains open for business and we are taking bookings for 2019.”
