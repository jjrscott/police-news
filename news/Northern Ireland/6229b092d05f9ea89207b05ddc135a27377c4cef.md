* Antrim & Newtownabbey

Detectives from PSNI's Public Protection Branch have welcomed the sentencing of 33 year old Neil Alexander from Newtownabbey for sexually assaulting a 30 year old woman at her home on 5 August 2017.

Mr Alexander pleaded guilty to sexual assault by penetration and sexual assault on 10 January 2019 and was sentenced to 12 months in prison and 2 years on license at Downpatrick Crown Court earlier today, Thursday 14th March.

Detective Constable Ellie May from PSNI's Public Protection Branch said: 'Sexual assaults can often go unreported and it can be extremely difficult for someone to report an incident of this nature but I hope that Neil Alexander's conviction today encourages others to come forward to Police. I want to reassure victims that if you do choose to speak to us you will be listened to, respected, treated sensitively and have your report thoroughly investigated. We will also be able to signpost you to support services such as Nexus and Victim Support among others.'

"I would encourage anyone to contact their local police if they have been the victim of a crime on the non-emergency 101 or in an emergency always call 999."
