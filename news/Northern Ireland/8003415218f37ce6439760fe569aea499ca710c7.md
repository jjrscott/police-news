Murder Investigation following deaths at Abbey Road, Lisnaskea

Detectives remain at the scene of the deaths of a 51 year old woman and a 55 year old man at a house in the Abbey Road area of Lisnaskea on the afternoon of Monday 15th May.

 Detective Chief Inspector Eamon Corrigan said: “Post mortem examinations will be carried out in due course and at this stage we are working to establish the circumstances surrounding the incident. Although our enquiries are at an early stage, we are threating the death of the woman as murder.

“The injuries to a man, aged in his 30’s, who was also in the house at the time of the incident and who suffered stab wounds to his abdomen, is being treated as attempted murder. He is currently in hospital in a stable condition.

“We are not looking for anyone else in relation to the incident at this time but I would ask anyone with any information which could assist us with our enquiries to contact detectives at the Incident Room in Lisnaskea on 101 quoting reference number 774 15/05/17.”
