* Belfast

Detectives are investigating an aggravated burglary at a house in Ardoyne, north Belfast last night, Saturday 21 December.

It's understood six masked men forced their way into a house on Hesketh Road at around 11.40pm.

They threatened the occupants, a male and female both in their 20s, who had managed to barricade themselves in an upstairs room. The intruders ransacked the property before fleeing emptyhanded.

The residents were left shaken but uninjured.

Detectives would like to hear from anyone who was in the area and who noticed the suspect males or anyone with any other information about this crime. Please call 101, quoting reference 2206 21/12/19.

Information can also be given anonymously through the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
