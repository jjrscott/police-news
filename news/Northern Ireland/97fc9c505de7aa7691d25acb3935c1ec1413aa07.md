Serious collision on M1

A serious collision on the M1 was reported to police at around 5.30pm on Friday 8 April.

Three vehicles were involved in the crash close to Cornakinnegar Bridge between junctions 9 and 10 westbound (Moira - Lurgan).

The motorway was initially closed between these junctions to westbound traffic however a subsequent closure was implemented on the eastbound side of the M1 between the same junctions.

A second unrelated collision also took place approximately one mile away, also countrybound.

The collisions and closures have had a significant impact on traffic with significant disruption and delays to journeys.

Details of any casualties are not available at this time.

The M1 is likely to remain closed into the night.
