Detectives investigating a stabbing incident at a flat in the University Street area of Belfast in the early hours of this morning, Saturday, 20 July, have arrested a 20 year old man on suspicion of grievous bodily injury with intent.

He remains in custody at this time.

Detective Inspector Kerry Brennan said: "I would appeal to anyone living in this block of flats who witnessed this incident, which spilled out from the flat into the corridor outside the front door of the premises, or anyone who has information that could assist us with our enquiries, to contact detectives at Musgrave on the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 121 20/07/19. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.
