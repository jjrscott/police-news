Police officer sustains broken ankle in assault

A police officer has sustained a broken ankle in an assault in Carrickfergus.

The officer was one of three who responded to reports of a fight between two men in the Victoria Road area at around 7.15pm on Tuesday 25 April.

Inspector Michael Simpson said: “Upon arrival officers approached the men. One of the males became aggressive with police and struck out at the officers punching one in the face, breaking the ankle of another and causing cuts and bruises to the face and body of the third.

The 28 year old assailant was arrested at the scene on suspicion of a range of offences including assault on police, criminal damage and grievous bodily harm. He remains in custody at present.”
