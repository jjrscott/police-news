Detectives are appealing for information following a report of shots fired at a vehicle in Jonesborough last night (Monday 3rd August).

Detective Inspector Handley said: "Shortly after 11:25pm, it was reported that a dark coloured Audi A4 vehicle had arrived in the Castle View area. One man exited the vehicle with his hood over his face and fired a number of shots at a black coloured Nissan X-Trail parked outside a house in the area. It was reported that a woman in her 50s and four children were inside the property but were not injured. Damage was caused to the car following the incident, as the dark coloured Audi A4 made off from the scene.

"The suspect vehicle was later recovered in the area of Thistle Cross by An Garda Siochana, having been set alight and completely destroyed.

"Enquiries are continuing to establish the circumstances, in what was an extremely distressing incident for those inside the house.
