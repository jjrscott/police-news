* Belfast

Detectives from PSNI's Terrorism Investigation Unit have welcomed the sentencing of Kevin McLaughlin at Belfast Crown Court earlier today, Friday 8 March, for possession of firearms, ammunition and explosives in suspicious circumstances.

The 36 year old from West Belfast was found guilty of the offences at a non-jury trial and was sentenced to five and half years in prison.

Detective Chief Inspector Stuart Griffin said: "This conviction follows searches which were carried out in west Belfast as part of an investigation into dissident republican terrorist activity. During a search of a house at Broom Close in the Twinbrook area, a significant quantity of bomb making components and ammunition were found in the attic including 3 mercury tilt switches.

A robust investigation followed that linked these articles to Kevin McLaughlin.

"I welcome today's success which demonstrates our commitment to tackling those involved in dissident republican terrorist activity.

"The materials which Mr McLaughlin possessed would likely have caused serious harm to communities in Northern Ireland and could have killed or injured.

"We will continue to work with communities to reduce the threat posed by those involved in such activity and would ask people to contact police if they have any suspicions about terrorist activity."
