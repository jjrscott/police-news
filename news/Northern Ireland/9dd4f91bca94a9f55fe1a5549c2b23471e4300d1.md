Police are appealing for witnesses following an aggravated burglary in the Stranmillis Gardens area of south Belfast in the early hours of Thursday, November 23.

Detective Sergeant Philip McCullagh, of the Reducing Offending Unit, said: “Police received a report at around 2.10am that two males had gained entry into a house occupied by three women, one man and two children.

“The males were reported to be armed with knives taken from the kitchen of the property.

“When confronted by one of the female occupants, the two males fled the scene with a number of items including a laptop, mobile phone and a purse.

“Police subsequently stopped two men nearby who matched the description given by the occupant and a number of items were recovered. Two men aged 25 and 30 were arrested on suspicion of a number of offences including aggravated burglary and assault on police and are currently in custody helping police with their enquiries.

“Police are appealing to anyone who may have seen any suspicious activity in the area or who may have information which could help them with their enquiries to contact the Reducing Offending Unit on 101 quoting reference number 71 of 23/11/2017.

“Information can also be given anonymously through the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
