Detectives investigating the murder of 73 year old Eugene Carr, who died following an attack at his home last year, have arrested a 30 year old man this morning, Wednesday 1 June, in the Newry area. Two house searches have also been carried out in the Newry and Rathfriland areas.

The Senior Investigating Officer for the case, Detective Chief Inspector Lee McNevison said: “Mr Carr died in the Royal Victoria Hospital on the evening of Tuesday 17 November 2015 as a result of injuries that he received when he was attacked whilst in his bed at his home in Clogharevan Park, Bessbrook, in the early hours of Monday 31 August 2015.
