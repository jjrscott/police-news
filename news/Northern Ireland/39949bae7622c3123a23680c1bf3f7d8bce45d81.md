A 33 year old man has been arrested following a proactive policing operation in east Belfast on Saturday afternoon.

Police carried a proactive search of a property at Kilbroney House, Greenway and seized thousands of suspected Diazepam tablets along with a small quantity of herbal cannabis and two mobile phones.

The search followed the interception of a parcel destined for the same address, which contained thousands of suspected Pregablin tablets.

The man was arrested on suspicion of importation of a Class C drug and attempted possession with intent to supply a class C controlled drug. He was released on bail pending further enquiries.

Tackling the illegal supply and use of drugs continues to be a priority for police and seizures such as this demonstrates the ongoing commitment to removing illegal drugs from society.

Police would encourage anyone who has any information about the use or supply of illegal drugs to contact police on the non-emergency number 101 with any information they have. Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.
