Police investigating the report of shots being fired at a property in The Green area of Lisburn on Tuesday, 28th of May, have appealed for witnesses and information.

It was reported to police at around 11.30 pm on Tuesday night that shots had been fired at the kitchen window of a property in The Green area of Lisburn.

A 27 year old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage and possession of a firearm and is currently in police custody.

Detective Sergeant Perks said: "Everyone has a right to live in a safe and stable community and this type of senseless and reckless criminality will not be tolerated.

"There were a number of occupants in the property at the time and fortunately nobody was injured as a result of this reckless act.

"I would ask - did you see anyone acting suspiciously in the area; did you see any suspicious vehicles? If you did, please come forward and speak to detectives at Lisburn on the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 2373 28/05/19."

Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crim
