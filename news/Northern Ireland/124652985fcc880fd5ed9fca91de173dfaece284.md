* Mid & East Antrim

Police have arrested a man following a burglary at commercial premises in the Woodside Road area of Ballymena in the early hours of Saturday 29th July.

Detective Sergeant Kerry Brennan said: “ Police received a report of a burglary in progress at a car dealership at around 1.40am this morning, and resources were immediately tasked to the scene. Upon arrival, officers observed a male attempting to force his way out of the compound through the main gates, in two vehicles which were already on the premises. A Ford Kuga was used unsuccessfully first, but on his second attempt, the male forced the gates in a Volkswagon Polo car, striking a police car which was positioned outside, before making off along the Woodside Road. A stinger device to deflate the tyres was successfully deployed as the car exited, however, and the man was arrested a short distance away by pursuit trained officers. Four officers were injured and two police vehicles damaged as a result of the incident and the 28 year old man, who was arrested on suspicion of a number of offences, remains in custody at this time.”

“We believe at this time that the man may have been dropped off at Woodside Road and are appealing for anyone who noticed a vehicle which looked out of place in the area last night or in the early hours to contact detectives in Ballymena on 101 quoting reference number 113 29/07/17 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.”
