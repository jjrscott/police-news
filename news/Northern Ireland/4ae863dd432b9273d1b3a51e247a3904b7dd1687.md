Detectives from PSNI Terrorism Investigation Unit (TIU) have arrested two people on suspicion of a range of terrorism-related offences.

A woman aged 31 was arrested when officers carried out a search operation at an address on Cladytown Road, Glarryford, yesterday evening, Friday 5 July. A 33 year old man was later arrested after police stopped a car on the Westlink in Belfast in a follow-up operation.

Detective Inspector Anthony Kelly said: "The proactive search at the property uncovered a range of suspected munitions and a quantity of ammunition. All items will now be subject to forensic examination."

The arrested pair have been taken to PSNI's Serious Crime Suite where they will be questioned under Terrorism legislation.
