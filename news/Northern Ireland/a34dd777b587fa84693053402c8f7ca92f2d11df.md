Chief Superintendent Emma Bond, Chair of the PSNI's Women in Policing Association said: "As part of our plans for this year's International Women's Day (IWD) event, our Association took the IWD universal theme of Each For Equal and invited our members to nominate male colleagues who have supported them in achieving gender parity.

"In previous years, we have used IWD to promote the positive contribution that females within our organisation have played in inspiring others.

"Recognising that gender equality is not a female-only issue, that it is everyone's responsibility, in line with this year's theme we took the decision to recognise male colleagues who have an important part to play.

"It is vitally important that our male colleagues play their part in empowering, supporting and being positive advocates for their female colleagues. Today's event was seen as providing an opportunity for the Women in Policing Association to recognise those who do that already." __ __
