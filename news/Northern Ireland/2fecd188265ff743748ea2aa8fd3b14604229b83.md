Earlier today, Friday 14 August, detectives from PSNI Terrorism Investigation Unit carried out a search at an address in Vicinage Park in north Belfast.

Items including laptops, electronics and herbal cannabis were seized during the operation which was focused on dissident republican activity.

As a result a 28 year old man was issued with a Community Resolution Notice for possession of a Class B controlled drug.

Detective Inspector Martin Cush said: "Today's operation is further evidence that those involved in dissident republican activity are actively involved in criminality, including drugs, operating under the convenient flag of 'paramilitarism'. The reality however is that they are criminals who will exploit any circumstances they can for their own gain. Be under no illusion, these so-called paramilitaries destroy lives and harm our communities.

Anyone with information should contact police on 101 or anonymously through the Crimestoppers charity on 0800 555 111, which gives people the power to speak up and stop crime."
