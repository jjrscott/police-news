* Belfast

Detectives from the Organised Crime Unit have seized a large quantity of suspected drugs following a search in north Belfast last night, Friday, 17th November.

Detective Inspector Andrew Hamlin said: “Police conducted a search of a property in the Newington Street area last night, at approximately 9pm. During the planned search officers seized approximately 30,000 suspected Xanax tablets, as well as a large quantity of suspected Class B controlled drugs. Police also seized drugs related paraphernalia. Enquiries into the matter are continuing.

Taking prescription drugs that you haven’t been prescribed in unregulated quantities can pose a massive risk to life. We are committed to removing drugs and illegal substances from communities in order to keep people safe.

The PSNI is committed to making Northern Ireland a hostile environment for those in our community who are involved in serious drug crimes. We will seek to identify them, arrest them and place them before the courts.

“Anyone with any information about drugs or any illegal activity should contact police by calling 101. Information can also be passed anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
