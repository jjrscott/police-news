Detectives from PSNI's Major Investigation Team have welcomed the sentence handed down to 40-year-old Jackie McDowell for the murder of 56-year-old Laurence Shaw in October 2017 in Larne.

At Laganside Court this morning, Tuesday 2 July, Jackie McDowell was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment.

Detective Inspector Joanne Harris said: "On Sunday 8 October 2017, 56-year-old Laurence Shaw was at his house in Hillmount Gardens, Larne. One of his friends called, accompanied by 40-year-old Jackie McDowell, also from Larne. He invited them both in and when just the two of them remained, Jackie murdered Laurence, slitting his throat in a senseless act of violence.

"Afterwards, Jackie set Laurence's house on fire in a bid to cover his tracks and drove off, calmly stopping at a petrol station for some cigarettes.

"Laurence's body was not discovered until the next day, brutally murdered in a place where he should have been safe.

"Laurence's family have been left traumatised by their loss.

"Whilst nothing will take away their pain, I hope they get some comfort from knowing that his killer is now behind bars."
