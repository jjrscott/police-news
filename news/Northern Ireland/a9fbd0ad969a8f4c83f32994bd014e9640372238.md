Detectives in Bangor are investigating two burglaries and an attempted burglary reported today (Wednesday, 30th September) that they believe may be linked.

Detective Sergeant Rhonda Magennis said: "We received a report around 2:40am this morning of a burglary at business premises on Balloo Avenue in Bangor where cash was stolen, and damage was caused inside the building.

"We also received a report at around 6:20am of an attempted burglary at commercial premises on Ballyrobert Road, Crawfordsburn, where two attempts were made to gain access to the building between 2am and 6am. We received a third report today, this time of a burglary at a business on Balloo Avenue in Bangor. Damage was caused to a window, a door and a computer inside the building. We believe this occurred between 5:30pm last night (29th September) and 9am today.
