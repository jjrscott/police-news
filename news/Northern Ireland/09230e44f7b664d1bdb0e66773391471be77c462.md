Detectives from Reactive and Organised Crime Branch have arrested two men and seized a substantial quantity of suspected herbal cannabis following the search of a vehicle in Ballymena this morning ( Saturday 7th May ).

Detective Inspector Keith Gawley said: “A lorry was stopped on the Moorfields Road in Ballymena by officers and searched shortly after 7am this morning. Suspected cannabis with a street value of approximately £300k was recovered from the vehicle and a 25 year old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of possession of class B drugs, possession of class B drugs with intent to supply and being concerned in the supply of class B drugs. A follow up search was conducted at a house in the Armagh area this afternoon where a 35 year old man was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class B drugs.

Anyone with information about the supply or use of illegal drugs can play their part by giving that information to police by phoning on 101. Information can also be given anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
