Robbery Liminary Road - Kells

Detectives in Ballymena are appealing for information following a robbery at premises on the Liminary Road in Kells on Friday night.

Two men armed with firearms forced their way into the premises at around 11pm and made the occupant hand over cash and keys to a black Range Rover and various other items. The Range Rover was recovered abandoned a short time later on the hard shoulder of the M2 Belfast bound carriageway opposite motorway services near Sandyknowes. The first man involved in the incident was wearing a black woollen hat, a black bomber jacket, blue jeans and spoke with a local accent. The second male was wearing dark clothing and a balaclava. The occupant was not physically injured.

Detectives have appealed for anyone who noticed the black Range Rover being driven between Kells and where it was abandoned on the M2 or anyone who has any information to contact them in Ballymena on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
