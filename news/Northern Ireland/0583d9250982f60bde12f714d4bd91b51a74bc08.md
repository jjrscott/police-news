Detectives from PSNI's Major Investigation Team have arrested two males aged 24 and 15 on suspicion of a number of offences related to an altercation which took place in Coolcullen Meadow in Enniskillen on Saturday 11 April.

18 year old John Paul McDonagh was murdered after a group of males brandishing weapons clashed in the street.

The two suspects, who were detained in the Enniskillen area this morning, have been arrested on suspicion of affray, wounding with intent and other violent offences in connection with that confrontation.

They remain in custody at present.

A 29 year old male was charged and has previously appeared in court in connection with Mr McDonagh's murder.
