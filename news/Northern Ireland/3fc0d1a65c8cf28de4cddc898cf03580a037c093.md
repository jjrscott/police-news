Fire - Albertbridge Road, Belfast

Detectives are appealing for information in relation to an arson of a flat on the Albertbridge Road in east Belfast yesterday afternoon, Monday 04 April.

Sometime between 2pm and 2.45pm a fire was started in a flat in the area. Although the occupants of the flat had left at the time of the fire other flats in the block were occupied and as such the fire could have had serious consequences. A large amount of damage was caused to the flat and to adjacent flats as a result of the fire.

Detective Inspector Snoddy said: â€œI would ask anyone who might have seen anyone acting suspicious in the area of the flat on Albertbridge Road around 2pm yesterday or who knows anything about this incident to contact detectives at Musgrave Police Station on the non-emergency number 101. Or if someone would prefer to provide information without giving their details, they can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800 555 111.
