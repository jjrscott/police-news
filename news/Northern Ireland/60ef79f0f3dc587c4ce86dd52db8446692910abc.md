Detectives investigating the murder of prison officer Adrian Ismay in 2016, have welcomed today's conviction of 49 year old Christopher Robinson for the horrific killing.

Detective Superintendent Richard Campbell said: "We welcome the guilty verdict delivered today by the judge and await the tariff setting of Christopher Robinson in due course.

"My thoughts today are first and foremost with Adrian's grieving wife, his three children and wider family circle who are still coming to terms with the pain and loss they feel every day.

"They will be reliving the horror of what happened when a device, which had been placed under his van, exploded in the Hillsborough Drive area of east Belfast on Friday 4th March 2016.

"Adrian, 52, who was a St John's Ambulance volunteer, died 11 days later in hospital on March 15th.

"I hope today's conviction will provide some comfort for Adrian's family. It should also serve as a warning to anyone involved in terrorism within our community that the PSNI will investigate these offences robustly and vigorously to bring offenders to justice."
