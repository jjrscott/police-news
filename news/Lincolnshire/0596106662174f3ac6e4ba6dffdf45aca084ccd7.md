Lincolnshire Police is supporting a national day to remember those who have died during the pandemic, and to show support for everyone who has been bereaved.

Spearheaded by end of life charity Marie Curie, and taking place today, Tuesday 23 March – the anniversary of the UK going into the first national lockdown – Lincolnshire Police is committed to supporting the National Day of Reflection, alongside a host of organisations, MPs, and celebrities’ who are backing the day.

To mark the National Day of Reflection our force took part in a one-minute silence.

Marie Curie estimates that more than three million people have been bereaved since the pandemic began, yet many have been unable to properly say goodbye to loved ones or grieve.

The National Day of Reflection gives the nation and communities a moment to remember, grieve and celebrate everyone who has died during this time and show support for our families, friends and colleagues who are grieving.

Chief Constable Chris Haward said: “The Covid-19 pandemic has struck at the heart of our society, affecting us all in one way or another. Many people have sadly experienced loss, illness, worry, stress or loneliness.

“Today marks one year since lockdown began, and in remembrance of that, we have taken a moment of time out just to reflect on what's happened and remember those people who have lost their lives and those families who have lost loved ones through the year.”

Marie Curie warns that without the right support for people who have been bereaved, the devastation that the pandemic has caused will impact the lives of people for generations.

**Matthew Reed, Marie Curie Chief Executive,** said: "As a frontline end of life charity, we see every day the huge contribution the police and all emergency services play in supporting the most vulnerable people in our society. We would like to thank every police officer in [insert name of police service] for their incredible commitment and dedication in protecting their local communities during these difficult times. The vital work they do must be extremely hard if you are also facing your own personal tragedies of grief and loss.

“It is why it is so important that we mark the huge amount of loss we’ve seen this year and show support for everyone who has been bereaved in the most challenging of circumstances.

“The National Day of Reflection on 23 March gives us a moment to reflect, remember and celebrate the lives of everyone that has died, as well as show our support to family, friends and colleagues who are bereaved during these challenging times – from Covid and other causes.”

**About the National Day of Reflection - A day to reflect, grieve and remember – 23 March 2021**

The National Day of Reflection on 23 March 2021 marks the first anniversary of the date that the first lockdown started. Over 3 million people have been bereaved since the first lockdown began. Behind the statistics and whatever the cause, every death has been devastating for their loved ones. Many of those bereaved have not been able to hold loved one’s hands as they were dying, properly say goodbye, comfort or even hug each other. They have been unable to mourn as they would in ‘normal’ times and will be more likely to struggle with the long-term effects of grief.

The National Day of Reflection will give the nation and communities a moment to remember, grieve and celebrate everyone who has died during this time and show support for our families, friends and colleagues who are grieving. The day is being led by Marie Curie and has been developed in partnership with other organisations who will get involved as part of a movement to support each other.
