We are appealing for witnesses and anyone with dashcam footage following a robbery at the Gulf Filling Station on Lea Road, Gainsborough this morning (March 24).

No injuries were reported and a quantity of cash was stolen from the premises. A burnt-out vehicle was located on Summergangs Lane and our officers and Fire & Rescue are currently on scene. We ask that residents in the Lea Road area shut their windows and doors due to the risk of smoke inhalation from the burnt-out vehicle.

We are particularly interested in any dashcam footage that was captured on Lea Road, Gainsborough this morning between 7:30 and 8:15am. If you have witnessed the incident or have dashcam footage available that can assist our officers with the investigation, please get in touch:

 * By calling 101 quoting incident 49 of today’s date.
 * By emailing force.control@lincs.pnn.police.uk – don’t forget to include incident 49 of today’s date on the subject line.
 * Anonymously, via the independent charity, CrimeStoppers on 0800 555 111 or online https://crimestoppers-uk.org/
