We are appealing for witnesses and dashcam footage following a fatal collision on the A16 Spalding bypass.

We received a call at 3.24pm yesterday (26th December) reporting a two-vehicle collision on the road between the McDonald’s roundabout and the industrial estate.

It involved a black Mercedes-Benz 200 and a blue Suzuki Swift.

The driver of the Suzuki, a woman aged in her 50s from the Boston area, was taken to hospital but later died.

Two other occupants of the Suzuki, both men, were also taken to hospital with serious injuries not thought to be life-threatening.

The driver of the Mercedes-Benz, a man, was taken to hospital with injuries which are not believed to be serious.

Part of the A16 was closed following the collision and re-opened around 10.40pm.
