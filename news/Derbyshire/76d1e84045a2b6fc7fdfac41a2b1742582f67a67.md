We are releasing images of a group of men we want to speak to about a burglary in Creswell.

We first appealed for information about this burglary several weeks ago but we are now in a position to issue these CCTV images.

Although the quality of the images is not great, they may be enough to jog someone's memory and help our investigation.

At about 2.30pm on Thursday 3 December, a group of men knocked on the door of a house in Duke Street, Creswell.

The homeowner, a woman in her 40s, let the men in and they took cash and a mobile phone before leaving.

The men left in a red car which was parked nearby.

If you can help us to identify these men, or if you have any information about the red car, please contact us.
