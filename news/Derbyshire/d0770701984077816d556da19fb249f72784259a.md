We're appealing for witnesses after a man reported that his dog was attacked by two other dogs in Littleover.

The man was walking his Pomeranian dog in Willson Avenue at around 9pm on Saturday 1 August, when he passed a family who were walking two dogs which are described as Husky or Akita type breeds.

These dogs reportedly attacked the Pomeranian causing serious injuries, which led to the dog later being put down.

The owners of the Husky/Akita type dogs are described as an Asian man and woman. The man was in his late twenties or early thirties and of medium build. The woman is described as having straight hair and being shorter than the man. They also had a young girl with them.

Did you witness this incident? Do you recognise the description of the dogs or their owners? If so, please contact PC Maddy Summerfield quoting reference number 20000400363.
