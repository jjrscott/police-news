A man who tried to rob a petrol station in Buxton made off empty-handed.

At around 11pm on Friday 6 March, a man went into the Essar (Spot) Service Station, in Leek Road.

He went to the counter and threatened the member of staff before demanding cash.

Staff activated the alarm and the man ran off toward Carr Road without taking anything.

He is white and wore a black jacket, beige trousers and smart shoes.

As he walked across the forecourt, he put a blue t-shirt over his head before going into the shop.

We want to speak to witnesses, or anyone who was driving in the area at the time who has dashcam footage.
