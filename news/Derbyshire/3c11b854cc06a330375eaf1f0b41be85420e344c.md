Three people have been arrested and weapons recovered after officers stopped a car in Heanor.

Officers saw a Vauxhall Astra in Market Street at around 3.30pm yesterday (Sunday 26 January), which they believed to have been stolen.

They approached the car and found two knives and a what appeared to be a gun inside.

Two men, aged 27 and 29 and a 20-year-old woman were arrested at the scene on suspicion of stealing the car, which had been reported stolen from Langley Mill earlier that day.

The 29-year-old was also arrested on suspicion of drink-driving.

They remain in custody today and are being questioned.

The weapons have been seized and the car recovered.
