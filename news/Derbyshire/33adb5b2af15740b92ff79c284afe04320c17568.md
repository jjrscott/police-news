Two people have been arrested in connection with a murder investigation in Killamarsh.

Police were called to reports of a disturbance at a house on Westthorpe Road around 10pm on Monday 29 March.

Ricky Collins was found seriously injured near the junction of Westthorpe Road and Upperthorpe Road during the evening of Monday 29 March.

The 31-year-old was treated by paramedics and taken to hospital, where he sadly died.

Officers have arrested a 16-year-old boy on suspicion of murder, and a 43-year-old man on suspicion of assisting an offender. They are both from the Sheffield area, and remain in police custody.

The scene on Westthorpe Road is still in place, and it is hoped the road will be able to fully re-open later today.

Detective Inspector Chris Marriott, of the East Midlands Special Operations Unit, said: "While we have arrested two people, and believe it to be an isolated incident, we are continuing to investigate a number of lines of inquiry and continue to appeal for any witnesses or anyone who has information about what happened to contact us."

Patrols are continuing and anyone who has concerns and wishes to speak to police is encouraged to talk to officers in the area.
