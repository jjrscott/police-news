A 30-year-old man has been charged with five offences following an incident in which a man was stabbed in Ripley.

Officers were called by East Midlands' Ambulance Service to reports that a man had been found with serious injuries in Albion Street, Ripley, at 3.30am on 1 June.

Following enquiries officers found that the man had been stabbed while in Ash Crescent, Ripley, and had then left the scene and driven to Albion Street.

The man, a 31-year-old from Ripley, has been taken to hospital where he remains and is recovering from his injuries.

Damon Allen was arrested in connection with the offence and has subsequently been charged with grievous bodily harm and possession of an offensive weapon.

He has also been charged with grievous bodily harm following an incident in Bath Street, Ilkeston, on 20 October, in which a man had an unknown substance allegedly thrown in his face.

Officers also charged Damon Allen with common assault and criminal damage following an alleged incident in Queen Street, Somercotes, on 15 April.

Mr Allen, of Welbeck Close, Somercotes, has been remanded in custody and is due to appear at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court today.
