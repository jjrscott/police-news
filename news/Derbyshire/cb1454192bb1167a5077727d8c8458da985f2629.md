Yesterday we told you about two arrests following reports of a robbery in Woodlands park in Swadlincote on Tuesday, 30 June.

It was reported at around 7.30pm that evening that a 16-year-old boy had been assaulted and threatened with a knife by three other young men.

The boy's Apple Air Pods were stolen.

Two 17-year-old young men from Burton-on Trent were arrested nearby. A third 17-year-old, also from Burton, has now been arrested. All three have been interviewed and released on police bail with conditions, amongst which are not to enter Derbyshire.

The incident is being investigated by Detective Constable Clare Sheppard, who said: "Whilst we are really pleased to have made arrests in this case, investigations continue.

"I am aware that there have been lots of comments on local social media and I would urge anyone who witnessed what happened or knows anything about it to make contact with me rather than comment on social media, so that it can help gain justice for the victim."
