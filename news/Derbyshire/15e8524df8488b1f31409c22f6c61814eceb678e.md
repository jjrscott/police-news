In the early hours of Tuesday 17 December Hayden Marshall was last seen in Derby city centre.

At the time he went missing, around 1.15am, Hayden was wearing a checked blue and white shirt, blue jeans and a black leather jacket when last seen.

Officers investigating his disappearance have been undertaking a number of enquiries, including a trawl of CCTV in the city centre.

The image above captures Hayden walking through the city centre towards the River Gardens. Hayden is then seen walking alongside the river before falling into the water. There is nobody else in footage.

Since then specialist search officers have been looking for Hayden in the River Gardens area, as well as further downstream, but at this time we have been unable to locate him.

Officers have been in regular contact with Hayden's family and they are being supported by specialist officers and our thoughts are with them at this time.

Detective Inspector Daniel Phillips, said: "I would like to thank the public for their help during the search for Hayden.

"It is clear that Hayden is a much loved friend, son and colleague and officers have spent a substantial period of time looking for Hayden.

"The footage captured at the River Gardens has focused our attention on the River Derwent and searches have been conducted in the city centre as well as further downstream - however, at this time, those searches have not found Hayden.

"The family, friends and colleagues of Hayden remain in our thoughts at this time and specially trained officers are supporting his immediate family."
