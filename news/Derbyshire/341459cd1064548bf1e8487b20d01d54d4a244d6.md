We have released images of a man we would like to speak in connection with the theft of a boy's bike from outside the Intu Centre.

CCTV images released following theft of a bike in Derby

The incident happened at around 4.25pm on Sunday 4 October. The 11-year-old had left his bike for just five minutes outside The Spot entrance, on London Road, while he went to get some food with his friends.

When he returned his bike had been stolen, and a smaller bike left nearby which officers believe had been left by the offender.
