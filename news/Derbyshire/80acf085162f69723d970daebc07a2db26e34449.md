We are excited to announce, that as part of Project Zao, the Derbyshire police-led operation against knife crime, and in support of the national Operation Sceptre, we are going to be running a mobile knife surrender scheme.

More details are to follow, however, during the week commencing Monday, 9 November to Saturday, 14 November residents of Derbyshire will be able to surrender any un-wanted knives at a mobile police-unit that will be situated at various locations across the county during the week.

Superintendent Sarah McAughtrie, who is in charge of Derbyshire police's response to knife crime, said: "We have listened to feedback from the public from previous knife surrender schemes and this year will provide a mobile service to widen the access to the scheme across the county.

"We are very much aware of the debate surrounding the effectiveness of such schemes, however, previous years have seen some particularly nasty weapons seized and if we take one knife off the street that could have been used to harm someone we will deem it a success. Unfortunately we have seen in Derbyshire that knives can kill, so any action we can take, to remove them from the hands of those that may carry out such crimes, we will certainly take."

The surrender scheme is part of a range of actions we will be taking as part of Operation Sceptre and more details will be released as we approach the week commencing 9 November.
