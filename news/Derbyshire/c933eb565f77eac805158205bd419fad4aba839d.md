We have released a CCTV image of missing girl Margaret Connors as we continue our search for her.

Margaret, who is in her teens, was reported missing on Wednesday, 14 August.

This CCTV image shows her at the Co-Op, in Crayford Road, Allenton, on August 19. She was seen walking toward Boulton Lane.

She is described as being around 5ft tall, of slim build, with long blonde hair and blue eyes. She speaks with an Irish accent and has a distinctive birth mark on the right-hand side of her face.

Margaret is believed to still be in Derby, however, she also has links to the Northampton area.

If you have seen her, or know of her whereabouts, phone Derbyshire police on 101 with reference number 929 of 2 August.
