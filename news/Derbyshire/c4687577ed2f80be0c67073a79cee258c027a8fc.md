We are releasing images of two men we would like to speak to about the theft of a significant amount of products from a shop in Ripley.

At about noon on Wednesday 14 October, two men went into Boots, in the High Street, and took a large amount of Loreal beauty products, worth hundreds of pounds.

We are investigating whether this is linked to a similar incident at the Belper branch of Boots.
