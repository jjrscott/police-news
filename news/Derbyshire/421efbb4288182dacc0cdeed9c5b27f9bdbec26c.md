Officers investigating a purse theft in Ripley have released CCTV images of two men they would like to speak with about the incident.

A 71-year-old woman reported that she had been shopping in the Co-op store in Derby Road, when she reached the till and realised her purse was missing from her bag.

The theft happened on Thursday 14 January shortly before 10.40am.

Bank cards from the purse were later used to make a purchase in another shop and attempts were also made to withdraw money from cash machines.

Officers are keen to hear from anybody who recognises the men pictured, as it is believed they may be able to assist with enquiries into the incident.
