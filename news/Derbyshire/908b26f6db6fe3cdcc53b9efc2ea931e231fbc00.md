A man has been sentenced for failing to provide a sample and assaulting a police officer after he asked him to take a breath test.

Ashley Rogers has been jailed for 26 weeks, disqualified from driving for two years and ordered to pay Â£200 compensation.

At around 11.45pm on July 13, two officers stopped Rogers in Raynesway, Alvaston, as they suspected him of drink-driving.

One officer asked him to take a breath test but he refused, grabbing the constable into a headlock, punching him and pulling him to the floor.

Rogers (32) of Atherfield Walk, Derby, was sentenced at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court on Monday 7 December. He pleaded guilty to assaulting an emergency worker by beating and failing to provide a breath sample.
