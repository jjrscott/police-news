Two people have been arrested in Stockbrook after officers were responding to drug dealing concerns.

The Pro-active unit, based at St Mary's Wharf, joined forces with the local housing association to carry out the action yesterday (Thursday 24 October).

Craig Guy, 35, of King Alfred Street, Stockbrook, Derby, has been charged with possession of crack cocaine and heroin with intent to supply, after he was arrested in the street nearby.

A further search of the address led to the arrest and subsequent charge of a 16-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, for possession of class A with intent to supply.

Guy has been remanded in custody to appear at Derby Magistrates' Court today (25 October) and the teenager was bailed to also appear at court this morning.
