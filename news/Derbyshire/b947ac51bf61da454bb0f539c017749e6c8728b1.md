We are appealing for information after an alleged burglary in Shipley, near Heanor.

It is reported to have happened sometime between 1.45am and 2.00am on Wednesday 24 March in Hardy Barn, Shipley.

An elderly woman was asleep in her home when she was awoken by an intruder, who quickly left after being disturbed.
