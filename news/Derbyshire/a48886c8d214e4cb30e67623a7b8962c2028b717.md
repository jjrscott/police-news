Officers were called to reports of a collision in Green Lane, Chinley, at 12.15pm today (25 October).

The incident involved a man and a woman, both pedestrians, and a Citroen C4.

The woman, who was in the late stages of pregnancy, was taken to Royal Stoke University Hospital by air ambulance, where the baby was delivered safely. The mother is currently in a serious but stable condition. The man was treated for what are believed to be minor injuries.
