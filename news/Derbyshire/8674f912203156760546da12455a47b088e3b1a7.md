A 46-year-old man reported that he was robbed by a group of teenagers by Riverside Chambers, in Full Street. His wallet, which contained a quantity of cash and bank cards, was stolen.

One of the bank cards was later used to make a number of transactions at convenience store in St Chads Road.

The incident happened at around 8.30pm on 2 December and officers have been following a number of lines of enquiry since then.
