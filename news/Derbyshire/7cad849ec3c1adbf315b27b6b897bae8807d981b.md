We are urging people to think about ways they can get involved in Neighbourhood Watch as the scheme launches a new website for Derbyshire.

We are urging people to think about ways they can get involved in Neighbourhood Watch as the scheme launches a new website for Derbyshire.

The site, www.derbyshireneighbourhoodwatch.co.uk, allows you to find out if there is a watch in your area and gives information on how you can join an existing group or set up your own watch.

It also features the latest watch news and information on Derbyshire's Neighbourhood Watch board members.

As a Neighbourhood Watch member, you'll also be encouraged to join Derbyshire Constabulary's messaging system, Derbyshire Alert, to get the latest updates from local officers in your area to your email inbox.

Assistant Chief Constable Paul Gibson said: "By joining a watch or becoming a co-ordinator, you can help keep your local area safe. It's also a good way of getting to know people in your local community.

"The new website is full of useful information about the scheme and I would encourage people to think about how they can get involved with Neighbourhood Watch."

You can contact Derbyshire Neighbourhood Watch by emailing hello@derbyshireneighbourhoodwatch.co.uk
