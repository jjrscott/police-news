A man who was found dead near to the Erewash Canal on Monday has been named as 37-year-old Robert Chatwin from Long Eaton.

Mr Chatwin was found by officers shortly after 2am on April 8, in a wooded area just off, what is known locally as, Dockholm canal path as shown in the attached google maps image. The path runs between the River Erewash and the Erewash canal in Long Eaton. He was pronounced dead at the scene and officers are currently investigating the circumstances surrounding his death.

He was last seen at around 2pm on Friday, April 5 in Walton Street, Long Eaton. He was wearing blue jeans, a grey fleecy jumper and black Nike trainers.

If you were in the area at the time and believe you saw Mr Chatwin, or have any other information which may help detectives with their enquiries, please get in touch.

We are also keen to speak to anyone who was driving in the area at the time and may have dashcam footage that shows someone matching the description of Mr Chatwin. If you believe you have video that may help the investigation then it should be downloaded to an external device and secured for officers to view.
