19 new officers have been sworn in at an attestation ceremony held at our Headquarters in Ripley last night.

New recruits joining Derbyshire Constabulary were welcomed by Derbyshire Police and Crime Commissioner Hardyal Dhindsa, who set a budget that allows police numbers in Derbyshire to grow by 120 officers and staff this financial year.

We've been working to make sure the extra posts are recruited, filled and trained, as the new staff join us over the course of the summer.

The 19 new officers attested last night have been in training school since January and will now work with a tutor constable at the start of their two-year probationary period.

They'll be posted right across Derbyshire from Swadlincote in the south to Glossop in the north.

Among them is a former secondary school teacher, sports coach, prison officer and ambulance dispatcher as well as two special constables and four Derbyshire police staff members from the control room, HR and disclosure and barring services unit.

Assistant Chief Constable Kem Mehmet said: "I'd like to welcome this intake - it's an exciting time for all of them as it's the start of their careers within the policing family. The force is growing and it's great to have them all a part of that growth."
