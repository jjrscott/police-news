Officers have released images of two men they'd like to speak to following thefts from cars in the Sawley and Long Eaton areas.

On Thursday 6 August we received reports that four cars had been broken into between 4pm and 5.30pm. Two of the cars were parked in Wilne Lane, Sawley and two were parked in Pasture Lane, Long Eaton.

Bank cards were stolen from three of the cars and later used to make purchases at a number of shops in Long Eaton and Toton.

Nothing was stolen from the fourth car.

Officers believe the two men (pictured) may be able to assist with their enquiries into these incidents.

Do you recognise these men?

Or do you have any other information which may help?

If so, please contact PCSO Kian Irwin quoting reference number 20*406656.
