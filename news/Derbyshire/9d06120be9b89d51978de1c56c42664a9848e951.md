A 36-year-old man has been jailed for seven years after a string of offences including kidnap.

Ian White's catalogue of offending began at 10.20pm on November 12, 2018, when he called for a taxi which arrived at a house in Cambourne Road, Mottram, Hyde, Manchester.

During the drive he took out a knife and began threatening the driver of the vehicle.

The taxi dropped him off in Buxton Road, Furness Vale, where he flagged down a passing 4x4 and demanded the 65-year-old woman drive him away from the scene.

The woman, who was not physically harmed during the incident, let him out in Yeardsley Lane, Furness Vale. A short time later White made his way to a pub in Buxton Road, Furness Vale.

He entered the pub threatened staff with the knife, caused criminal damage within the business and then left.

White then knocked on the door of a nearby house demanding a taxi be called for him. When the owner, a 75-year-old man, refused to call White a cab he forced his way into the property, assaulting the pensioner and stamping on his dog.

He then left this address and was detained by officers in Buxton Road.

White was charged with 16 offences including threats to kill, possession of a bladed article in public, criminal damage, kidnapping, ABH, affray and causing unnecessary suffering to an animal.

He appeared at Derby Crown Court on May 21 where he pleaded guilty to all offences (other than an attempted robbery which he pleaded guilty to theft from a person) and was sentenced to seven years in prison.
