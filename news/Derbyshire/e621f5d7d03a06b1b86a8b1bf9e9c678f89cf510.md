Officers are appealing for witnesses to an assault that saw a 12-year-old boy kicked and punched.

The incident happened in the carpark of the Lidl, off Swarkeston Road, in Chellaston at around 3pm on December 7 last year.

A man and a woman, who were driving a silver/grey van, stopped to assist the victim, who suffered serious bruising to his back and face, and officers are wanting to speak to the pair as witnesses to the incident.
