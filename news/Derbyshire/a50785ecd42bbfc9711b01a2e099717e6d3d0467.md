A motorcyclist, who died in a collision on the A621 near Owler Bar on Monday, July 15, has been named as Jay Titterton, from Derby.

The family of Mr Titterton, who was 48, are being supported by specialist officers and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.

We were called to reports of a collision at around 3.15pm on the A621 near the junction with Car Road.

A KTM Super Duke R motorbike travelling from Owler Bar to Baslow had left the carriageway and collided with a stone wall.

East Midland Ambulance Service and an air ambulance crew were also in attendance. Sadly, Mr Titterton was pronounced dead at the scene.

An investigation into the circumstances surrounding the collision has been launched and our officers are appealing for information from the public.

In particular they want to hear from any motorists with dash cam devices, who were travelling in either direction on the A621 between Owler Bar and Baslow at the time.

If you have any footage, or have any other information, call our collision investigation unit on 101 and quote reference 19*369686.
