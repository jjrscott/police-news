A 31-year-old man who had been arrested in connection with the murder of a Chesterfield man has been released on police bail.

The man, from Chesterfield, was arrested earlier in the week on suspicion of assisting an offender.

Yesterday Daniel Walsh, of Marsden Street, Chesterfield, was charged with the murder of 71-year-old, Graham Snell, who was reported missing on June 30.

The 29-year-old appeared at Chesterfield Magistrates' Court this morning (July 5) where he was remanded in prison to appear at Nottingham Crown Court on Monday, July 8.

Enquiries into the death of Mr Snell have centred on two addresses in Marsden Street and Oakamoor Close, Chesterfield.

The scene in Marsden Street will remain in place over the weekend - the scene in Oakamoor Close has been closed.

Due to police contact prior to Mr Snell's death Derbyshire Constabulary has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct in relation to this case.

Officers are still keen to hear from anyone who may have seen anything suspicious or out of the ordinary between Wednesday June 19 and Sunday June 30 in those two areas.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact Derbyshire police immediately on the 101 number or anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 with reference 19*340439.
