We're appealing for witnesses following a collision on the A617 near to Chesterfield which left a cyclist with serious injuries.

It happened just before 7.40pm yesterday (Tuesday 20 October) on the westbound carriageway, in between the M1 and Chesterfield, near to Temple Normanton.

A van allegedly collided with the cyclist but did not stop.

The cyclist suffered injuries to his head and chest and was taken to hospital in Sheffield.

Later, at around 9pm, officers stopped a van in Baslow which was believed to have been involved in the incident.

A 73-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and failing to stop at the scene of an accident.

We would like to hear from anyone who may have seen the collision, or with dashcam footage before or after the incident. Please also get in touch if you may have noticed a black van with damage to the front or side during that time frame.

If you have any information which you think could help with our inquiries you can contact us using one of the following methods.

Please quote reference number 20*554107, and the name of the officer in the case PC Ian Kelly.
