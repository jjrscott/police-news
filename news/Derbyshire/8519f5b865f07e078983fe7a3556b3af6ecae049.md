After a busy weekend we are now working hard with our partners across the county to clear and re-open roads that have been closed due to flooding.

To help this process we would urge the owners of cars that have been abandoned to make arrangements, as soon as possible, to have their cars recovered where it is safe to do so.

Firstly check the Derbyshire County Council or Derby City Council websites to make sure the road where you left your vehicle is no longer closed.

While it is important that abandoned vehicles are recovered as soon as possible so they do not obstruct the highway, please make sure it is safe to return to your vehicle and do not put yourself in any danger.

For an up-to-date list of affected roads and any road closures in the city, visit: https://news.derby.gov.uk/storm-dennis-weather-and-flooding-update/

For roads elsewhere in the county, go to: https://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/transport-roads/roads-traffic/roads-and-traffic.aspx
