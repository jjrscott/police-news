The woman, who we believe may have been assaulted, was found next to her car which was parked in a layby in the Curbar Edge area at around 11 am on Monday 4 January.

We think the man had been passing by, and the woman also asked him to re-position the wing mirrors on her car which was a white Vauxhall Corsa.

Officers would really like to speak to this man as part of their inquiries.

They would also like to hear from anyone else who may have been in the area around the time and noticed the car, or the woman who had been wearing black leggings and a grey hoody.

If this was you, or if you have any information which could help, please get in touch using the non-emergency methods below.

Please quote reference 21*10234, and the name of the officer in the case DC Claire Laughton.
