The family of Jean Levers, 79, who tragically died after a collision yesterday morning, have paid tribute to the 'loveliest person you could know'.

Officers received a call to report a collision between a vehicle and a pedestrian in Derby Road, Sandiacre shortly after 9.10am.

 Mrs Levers from Sandiacre was pronounced dead at the scene of the incident.

Her family have now released the following words of tribute:

'Jean was the loveliest, kindest person you could know.

'She will be sadly missed. She was known to everyone around here and was much loved by everyone who knew her.'

Mrs Levers' family have also asked for the privacy to grieve at this extremely difficult time.

Yesterday afternoon officers appealed for information about the driver of a blue Toyota Aygo, who they believed may be able to assist with their enquiries.

The Aygo driver was traced shortly after this appeal was issued, and will be attending a voluntary interview later today.

A 50-year-old man was arrested, at the scene, in connection with the incident and has since been released under investigation.
