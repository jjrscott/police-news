We are appealing for information to try to trace the family of a man who fell ill in Alfreton yesterday.

The man was taken ill in Rogers Lane, at the One Pound Plus store, at around 12.30pm on Saturday 23 May. He was found by a passer-by, who call for an ambulance.

We believe he may own the shop where he was found.

We believe he is in his early 40s, lives in Derby and is originally from the Middle East.

The man remains in hospital. We have conducted extensive inquiries since the man was found ill but we have not been able to trace his family.

If you can help, please contact us quoting reference 655 of May 23;
