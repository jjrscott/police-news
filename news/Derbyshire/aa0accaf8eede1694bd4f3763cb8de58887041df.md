An elderly man awoke to find a burglar in his house last night.

The man, who is in his 80s, was asleep at his home in Hady Lane, Chesterfield, when he heard a noise at about 7.50pm.

He saw a man's face at the door and the victim asked him what he was doing. The burglar left and the victim got up, discovering the back door had been broken.

We don't believe anything was stolen.

A blue BMW was seen in the area at the time and we are trying to trace it and the person driving.

We want to hear from anyone who was driving in Hady Lane between 7.40pm and 7.50pm and who has dash cam footage that may show the BMW.
