We're alerting residents in the High Peak and surrounding areas to a scam that we have had several calls about in recent weeks.

We are asking you to talk to any elderly or vulnerable people in your family about this scam because sadly, they are often victims.

The caller pretends to be a police officer from a London-based police station. They go on to say that they are investigating the unauthorised use of that person's bank card and tells them not to talk to anyone else about the call as it may jeopardise the police investigation.

We're aware that a number of different names have been used by this scammer including Sergeant Watson, DC Morris, DC Andrews, DC Ryan, DC Clarke and Sergeant Wiggins.

If you receive such a call you should not give out any personal information and hang up the call immediately.

We know that this type of call can be linked to courier fraud.

This means that victims will be encouraged to withdraw funds from their bank account, give bank cards and - in our latest incidents - make purchases of gold bullion or high-end jewellery from specified jewellers and give it to a courier arranged by the 'police officer.'

The police will never contact you asking for banking information or request that you withdraw money from an account, purchase gold bullion or high-value jewellery to aid an investigation.

Fraudsters often target geographical areas where they know elderly or vulnerable people live, so we would ask that if you have family or friends who are vulnerable in any way that you make them aware of this scam.

**What to do**

If you, or someone you know, receives a call of this nature please contact us as soon as possible. We will then assess the area that is being targeted, alert the banks and endeavour to protect other local residents to prevent any financial loss.

Should you receive one of these calls, we advise you to end the call, wait five minutes and ensure you can hear a dial tone before calling us on 101. To call your bank, please use the number found on the back of your card. All reports of this nature also need to be reported to Action Fraud 0300 120 2040 or online https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/
