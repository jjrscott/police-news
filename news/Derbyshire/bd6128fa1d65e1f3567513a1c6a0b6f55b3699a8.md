The family of a man who died in a collision on the A60, near to Belph, have paid tribute to their much-loved son, fiance, dad and brother.

Bradley Tyas

Bradley Tyas, from Chesterfield, died tragically yesterday (Thursday 21 January) after a collision between the Audi he was travelling in, and a White DAF lorry.

The incident happened at around 6.20 am, on the A60, near to the junction with Hennymoor Lane.

The 23-year-old sadly died at the scene.

Bradley's family have released an image and paid tribute to him. In a statement, they said: "Yesterday, we lost a very special person. Anyone who had the pleasure of knowing Brad will understand how devastated we all are.

"He was the kindest, most loving person, who could light up a room with his energy and smile and his contagious laugh. He had a massive character, full of life, charming and funny.

"This is truly a huge loss to us all, taken from us so young with his whole life and future in front of him, and having only just become a Dad to a beautiful son of only seven weeks old."

"He leaves behind his beloved Fiancee, son, his Mum and Stepdad, his Dad, and two devoted sisters."

Our thoughts remain with Mr Tyas family at this distressing time.

Officers would still like to speak to anyone who hasn't yet got in touch with us and were driving along the A60 at Belph between 6 am and 6.15 am yesterday.
