Four people have been charged as part of a large-scale operation to tackle drugs in Derby.

Officers began an investigation into alleged drug dealing in the city last August and in the last six months, have arrested 11 people as part of the inquiry.

During this time, several houses across the city have been visited with drugs recovered and a large amount of cash seized. The latest day of action took place on Tuesday 2 March, when officers executed a warrant in Chellaston and found a substantial amount of cocaine.

Ajmal Hussain (29,) of Pybus Street, Derby; Jameel Hussain (31), of Clarence Road, Derby, Michael Ward (46) of School Lane, Chellaston and Kamar Adris (31) of Dairy House Road, Derby have all been charged with possessing cocaine with intent to supply, conspiring to supply cocaine and acquiring or using criminal property.

They have appeared before magistrates in the city today (Thursday 4 March 2021) and have been remanded in custody until April 1.

The other seven arrested people have been released under investigation while detectives continue their inquiries.

Detective Inspector Dave Stocks, of the Specialist Crime Unit, said: "We know that drug dealing can have a real negative impact on the community and illegal substances can blight the lives of vulnerable people.

"This is why we will always investigate allegations of drugs activity in an area and I would urge anyone who wishes to speak to the police about drugs to come forward.
