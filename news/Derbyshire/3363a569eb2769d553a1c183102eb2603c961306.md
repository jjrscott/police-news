Officers investigating a distraction theft have released two CCTV images of men they'd like to talk to about the incident.

A 75-year-old woman was approached and asked for directions by a man in the car park of Tesco in Mickleover and later discovered that her purse had been stolen. Bank cards from the purse had been used to withdraw cash from an ATM at the Tesco store, in Kipling Drive, after the incident and a transaction was made at a gaming store in Derby city centre later that same day.

 The man who approached the victim is described as having short dark hair, speaking with an eastern European accent and wearing a white top and a black jacket.

The incident happened shortly after 1.40pm on Thursday, 23 May.
