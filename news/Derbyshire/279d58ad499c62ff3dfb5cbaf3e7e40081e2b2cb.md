Officers are appealing for the public's help following an assault in Creswell, last night (15 January).

We were called to reports that two men had been assaulted by four men in Elmton Road, at around 11.45pm. The pair were left with serious, but not life-threatening injuries, as a result of what is being treated as an isolated incident.

Residents will see an increased police presence today as enquiries continue and we would urge anyone who is concerned to speak to officers or contact their local policing team directly or through the below methods.

Detectives are keen to speak to anyone who may have been in the area at the time and may have witnessed the incident. They also want to hear from anyone who may have CCTV in the area or dashcam footage taken in the area at the time of the incident.
