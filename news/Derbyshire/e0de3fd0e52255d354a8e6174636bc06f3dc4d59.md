Officers are appealing for the public's help after a large amount of distinctive jewellery was stolen during a burglary of a house in Litton, near Buxton.

Between 8.40pm on Tuesday, 18 February, and 11am the following day burglars broke into a house in Litton and stole a large amount of jewellery.

The pieces, which are of high sentimental value, are distinctive and it is hoped that people may have been offered them for sale.
