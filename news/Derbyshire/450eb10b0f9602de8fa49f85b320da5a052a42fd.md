A 39-year-old Derby man has been charged with a number of drug offences after crack cocaine, cocaine and heroin with a street value of tens of thousands of pounds were found at an address in Derby.

Officers arrested Lenworth McLean as he left a house in Silverhill Road, Derby, on 23 September after officers witnessed alleged drug dealing in Wilmot Street, Derby.

After his arrest officers entered the property and inside found thousands of pounds worth of crack cocaine, cocaine and heroin - along with a substantial amount of cash.

The 39-year-old, of Shardlow Road, Derby, has now been charged with three counts of possession with intent to supply heroin, crack cocaine and cocaine and possession of criminal property in relation to the cash found in the house.

He was remanded in police custody and appeared at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court on 24 September where he was remanded to prison. He will next appear at Derby Crown Court on 22 October.
