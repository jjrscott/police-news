The family of a man who died in a collision in Woodhead Road have paid tribute to a "bright, enthusiastic and much-loved son and brother".

Andrew Burr was driving his blue BMW 1 along the Woodhead Road between 8pm and 9pm on Monday 17 August.

The 24-year olds car left the road and tragically Andrew, who was an apprentice engineer at Tulip in Dukinfield, was found dead at the scene.

A statement from Andrew's family said: "Andrew was a bright, enthusiastic soul and a much-loved son and brother.

"He was the person you would want there next to you if you had a problem and nothing was too much trouble for him.

"Andrew was very well known in Tintwistle, as well as further afield, and had a wide circle of friends. We have been absolutely inundated with cards and messages from friends, people from his time at university and his job.

"It has been incredible to see how many people Andrew touched during his life and we are hugely thankful for everyone who has been in touch."

A file is being prepared for the coroner in relation to the collision and anyone who was in the area at the time and may have seen Andrew, or the blue BMW 1 series car, is asked to contact Derbyshire police using any of the below methods, including reference 20*429374 in any correspondence:
