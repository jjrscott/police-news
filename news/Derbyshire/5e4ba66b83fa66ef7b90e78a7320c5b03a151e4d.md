A 30-year-old man has been charged with assault after allegedly stating he had coronavirus and then coughing at an officer.

Officers were called to Chesterfield Road, in Dronfield, at 12.20pm yesterday (2 April) to reports that a 53-year-old man had been assaulted and left with injuries to his face.

At the scene officers arrested Jack Bingley on suspicion of assault.

As the 30-year-old, of Loakfield Drive, Sheffield, was being led away he allegedly coughed towards an officer after telling officers that he was suffering from coronavirus symptoms.

He was further arrested for assaulting an emergency worker.

Mr Bingley has now been charged with one count of common assault and one count of common assault of an emergency service worker.

He has been released on conditional bail and will appear before Chesterfield Justice Centre on 3 June.

Following advice from medical staff at the Chesterfield Royal Hospital the officer has not had to self-isolate.
