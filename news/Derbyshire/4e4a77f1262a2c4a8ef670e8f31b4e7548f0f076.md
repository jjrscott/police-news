The first intake of police officers for 2020 were welcomed into force last night, to mark the end of 17 weeks of training with a special ceremony at joint police and fire headquarters in Ripley.

New officers swore the attestation oath, watched by their proud families and friends, in front of Peter Leatherland JP, Assistant Chief Constable Paul Gibson and the High Sheriff of Derbyshire William Burlington.

Since they started last November, the officers have been given the fundamental training to begin their new careers and be able to keep the public and themselves safe.

From next week, they will be deployed throughout Derbyshire including Buxton in the north of the county, Matlock in the Derbyshire Dales, Amber Valley, Erewash and areas of Derby city.

Amongst the new recruits, there are three former special constables and eight worked for us in various roles in the control room, public protection, crime investigation and five of them were police community support officers.

We are currently recruiting Police Community Support Officers.

We wish all 20 of our police recruits the best of luck in their new careers.
