Two men have been arrested after a police pursuit in Clay Cross in the early hours of this morning.

Officers on duty in the area noticed a suspicious vehicle in Tupton Road at around 4.25am.

The white Seat Ibiza passed them and failed to stop, resulting in a 30-minute pursuit. The car was eventually stopped in Lawrence Road, North Wingfield and the two men were arrested.

The driver, a 21-year-old man from Clay Cross, was arrested on suspicion of failing to stop, dangerous driving, criminal damage and drug driving. He has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

A 22-year-old passenger in the car has been charged with possession of an offensive weapon and possession of a class A drug, after a quantity of suspected cocaine was found.

Jordan Piper, of North Street, Clay Cross is due to appear at Northern Derbyshire Magistrates Court on 29 March.
