On Friday 1 May, Assistant Chief Constable Kem Mehmet welcomed nineteen new police officers on behalf of Derbyshire Constabulary.

The new police constables began their training at the start of February, before the guidance on social distancing was put in place. Their training was condensed down slightly to finish a few weeks earlier than originally planned.

They will be returning to our training school later on in the year for their pre-planned training which all student officers undertake after being out on their sections.

Most of the group of officers were previously employed by us in various jobs within the force, including PCSOs, detective staff investigators, information services, control room staff, to name a few. One student was an former officer from another force.

Earlier this year, alongside one of our PCSOs, PC Meikel Miller who is part of this group was awarded the Chief Constable's Commendation for her outstanding work when assisting a suicidal member of the public.

We wish them all the best in their careers with us.
