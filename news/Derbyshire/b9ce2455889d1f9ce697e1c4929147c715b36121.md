We have released an image of a man who we would like to speak to about an allegation of GBH.

Matthew Bestwick has links to the Burton, Mansfield, Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottingham and Cossall areas.

It is believed his appearance may have altered slightly since the photograph was taken and he may now be clean shaven with a shaved head.
