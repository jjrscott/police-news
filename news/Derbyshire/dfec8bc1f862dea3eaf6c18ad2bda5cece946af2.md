Nominations to find Derbyshire's PC, PCSO, and Safer Neighbourhood Team of the Year are now open!

We need your help to identify individuals and teams who over the last year have made a significant contribution to making Derbyshire a safer place to live, work and visit.

Every day, we see dedicated individuals and teams working for Derbyshire Constabulary go to extraordinary lengths to help create a safer Derbyshire for the people who live and work here.

We receive messages of appreciation from people across Derbyshire (and beyond) who have come into contact with our officers and staff, from those who were supported through a difficult time to people wanting to thank officers for saving their life.

Our Celebrating Achievement Awards are the perfect way to say a big thank you to the people who deliver an incredible service 24/7, 365 days of the year. If you know a deserving police officer, police community support officer (PCSO) or Safer Neighbourhood team, then this is your chance to show what they mean to you.

The judges will be particularly looking out for nominees who embrace the force's principles:

 * **Doing the right thing**
 * **Making a difference**
 * **Shaping the future**

This year, we have the following awards to hand out:

**Community Police Officer of the Year**

 * Has an officer helped you resolve a difficult situation?
 * Has an officer made a difference to the quality of life in your area?
 * Has an officer exceeded your expectations?
 * Has an officer gone the extra mile, perhaps in their own time?

The award is open to any police officer serving within Derbyshire Constabulary. It is not restricted to officers who have a specific community role. The diversity of the work carried out by the police force means that service to the community can encompass a wide range of activities.

**Police Community Support Officer of the Year**

The award for Police Community Support Officer of the Year recognises outstanding contribution within the community in addressing local concerns, fear of crime and on improving reassurance.

**Neighbourhood Team of the Year **

This award for the best Safer Neighbourhood team is aimed at highlighting the fantastic work done by officers, staff and volunteers, working with their partner organisations in the community.

Nominations will stay open for the month of March.

Members of the public, schools, voluntary and community groups and partner organisations who would like to nominate someone for an award can do so by submitting a nomination form here.

That's the quickest and easiest way, but you can also write to the Chief Constable, Derbyshire Constabulary Headquarters, Butterley Hall, Ripley, Derbyshire DE5 3RS.

Please include as much information as possible to enable us to judge effectively.

Winners will be announced at our Celebrating Achievement Awards at the end of June. Good luck to all!
