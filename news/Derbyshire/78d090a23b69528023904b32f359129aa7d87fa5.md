Officers investigating several thefts in Littleover have released these images of two men they would like to speak to.

A Nissan Micra was broken into shortly after 12.30am on Sunday 24 May when it was parked in Shaldon Drive. A bank card was stolen from inside.

We are investigating whether this case is linked to several other vehicle break-ins, which have happened in Littleover in recent months.
