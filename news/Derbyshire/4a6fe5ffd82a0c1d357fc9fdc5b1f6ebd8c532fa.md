Officers are appealing for information after a collision on the A617 near the M1 at Chesterfield.

We were called to reports of a collision involving a green Kawasaki ZX motorcycle on the A617 between the Hornsbridge roundabout and the M1 at 5.25pm on Saturday, 13 July.

The rider and pillion were taken to hospital for treatment for serious, but not life-threatening, injuries.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who may have been in the area at the time and may have seen the collision - in particular drivers with dashcam footage of the incident or the moments leading up to it.
