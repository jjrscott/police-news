We have created an extra worksheet for children as part of our campaign to support youngsters who may be suffering abuse at home.

Last week, we launched our 'It's Okay to Say' initiative, which encourages children to think about who their trusted adults are and contact the police or charities if they need support.

The campaign has been well-received and we were pleased when several people who work with children contacted us to ask for an additional resource. We listened to your feedback and today we are including a 'helping hand' worksheet to help children identify their trusted adults.

This can be downloaded from our website, along with another worksheet and colouring activity.

We launched 'It's Okay to Say' because we are aware that with the temporary closure of schools, sports clubs and other regular groups children attend, youngsters don't have regular interaction with trusted adults, who may be the people they talk to about issues they are facing at home.

We are asking those who typically work with children to share these resources and we want parents and carers to print copies for their children, or if that's not possible, show them to their children and take time to talk to them about trusted adults.

For older children, messages are being communicated via social media, encouraging them to contact charities such as the NSPCC and Childline, or to speak to the police or Crimestoppers directly.

If you are concerned about a child, you can contact police online;

 * Facebook - send us a private message to /DerbyshireConstabulary
 * Twitter - direct message our contact centre on @DerPolContact
