Two men have been charged with drugs offences following an operation by our County Lines Disruption Team.

Officers visited a flat in Charnwood Street, Derby, this morning (Wednesday 23 October) and arrested two men inside on suspicion of possessing heroin and crack cocaine with intent to supply.

Nikolas Balog (19), of Somerset Street, Derby and Endrit Pepaj (20), of Goldmer Close, Shoeburyness, Southend-on-Sea, have been charged with the alleged offences and are due to appear before Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court tomorrow.
