We are releasing CCTV images of Joshua Jones on the day he went missing, in a bid to find the 29-year-old.

These CCTV images show Joshua in the shop Boyes in Matlock at about noon on Saturday 12 December.

He is wearing a pair of blue jeans, a grey Superdry coat which is darker on the sleeves with a hood that is green on the inside.
