We continue to be concerned for the safety of missing Derby man Joseph Akoev.

Joseph Akoev was last seen at his home in Alwards Close, Alvaston, Derby, on 24 December, but has not been seen since.

Joseph, 57, who is originally from Georgia, was reported missing to us on 24 February. However, despite a number of enquiries, officers have been unable to trace him or any of his family members.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who has any information about Joseph's whereabouts or any family members who may be able to help locate him.

We are aware that the two pictures of Joseph are not of the highest quality but they are the only ones available.
