Today (Thursday, January 24), 18 police officers come to the end of 17 weeks of police training in training school and next week, they'll be out and about policing the streets and protecting the communities of Derbyshire.

Matlock, Chesterfield, Ripley, Derby, Clay Cross, Killamarsh, Peartree, Swadlincote and Ilkeston are the places to welcome our newest officers, covering the north and south of the county.

Tonight's attestation ceremony hosted by Deputy Chief Constable Gary Knighton at our headquarters will be one of the last times they'll be together as classmates, as they formally receive their powers and warrant cards ready for the next stage in their careers.

They're from a diverse range of backgrounds with a former army sniper, personal trainer, supermarket manager, immigration officer and tax collector now becoming Derbyshire police officers. Two have previously volunteered as special constables; two were police community support officers here in Derbyshire and one a 999 call handler for South Yorkshire Police.

Deputy Chief Constable Gary Knighton said: "It’s a very exciting time for Derbyshire Constabulary and I’d like to congratulate all the officers and welcome them into our policing family. I'm nearing the end of my 30-year policing career and what I think is the best job in the world!

"It’s now a regular occurrence welcoming friends and family to our headquarters and I am so pleased so many people will be joining us tonight to see our new recruits."
