We're appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted in his home in Darley Abbey.

It was reported that a 32-year-old man had been assaulted after two men knocked at his door in Darley Abbey Drive and forced their way in, at around 5pm on Friday 15 January.

The men asked for money, but were then disturbed by the man's wife and ran off.

Shortly before the incident, one man had come to the door of the house and when the owner had answered he said that he had got the wrong address and left.

The victim was left with bruising following the incident, but his injuries are not thought to be serious.

The men are described as follows:

Man 1 - white, around 6ft 2ins tall and of large build. He was wearing all dark clothing including a scarf pulled up over his nose, and black beanie hat with white googles on top. The top he was wearing also had a large logo on it.

Man 2 - approximately 6ft 2ins tall, large build, wearing all dark clothing including a beanie hat and black gloves.
