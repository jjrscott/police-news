### Domestic abuse: What is financial abuse?

A part of coercive control, financial abuse rarely happens in isolation and in many cases, it is used alongside other abusive and threatening behaviours. But what does financial abuse look like?

### The definition of financial abuse

Financial abuse is a part of coercive behaviour. It is often used by abusers to maintain control over the victim and to exert power over them. It isolates, deprives and strips the victim of independence while often leaving them with long lasting financial, and emotional, damage.

A key aspect of financial abuse is the restriction of access to money, however, a study conducted by Women's Aid has found that it can also include:

 * Control of access to finances
 * The abuser not allowing money for essentials
 * Victims having to give p their home or assets as a result of leaving the relationship
 * Build up of debt as a result of the abuser
 * The abuser using the victim's details to set up financial accounts
 * Loss of earnings through impacted ability to work

Financial abuse doesn't rely on proximity and can be used by the abuser to maintain control over the victim from a distance, or even after the victim has left the relationship.

### What to do if you are suffering from financial abuse or are worried about a loved one?

Restricting access to finances means that victims have little resistance and limited - or no - means to escape the relationship.

Derbyshire Constabulary has officers dedicated to dealing with instances of domestic abuse; however, frontline officers are also taught to spot the signs of abuse.
