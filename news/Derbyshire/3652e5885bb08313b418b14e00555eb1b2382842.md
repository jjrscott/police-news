A man has died following an alleged assault in Newton and we are trying to trace witnesses.

We were called at 4.30pm on Saturday 12 September to reports that two men, aged 65 and 51, had had an altercation on the playing fields off Town Lane and that one man had been allegedly been assaulted.

The 65-year-old man was taken to hospital the following day and the 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm.

The older man later died in hospital and the man in custody was further arrested on suspicion of manslaughter.

We believe there were two groups of teenagers at the playing fields that afternoon who may have witnessed what happened, or perhaps have recorded footage on their mobile phones. One group of youngsters were playing football while the other group had bikes.
