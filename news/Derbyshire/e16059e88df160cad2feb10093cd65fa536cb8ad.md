With the county having been placed in Tier 4, as a result of the rising infection rates and increased pressure on the NHS, it is important that everyone does their bit to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

Tier 4 and New Year's Eve

It is very important that everyone understands what the restrictions are in Tier 4 and how this affects you and your family: Tier 4: Stay at Home - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)

This evening sees the end of a very tough year for everyone, however, it is essential that you do not mix with anyone outside of your household or support bubble. These restrictions are in place to keep you, your loved ones safe and your community safe - and we would ask everyone plays their part.

If you are found to be at a gathering, whether tonight or any date in the future when restrictions are in place, then action may be taken against you.
