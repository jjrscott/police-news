A 25-year-old man from Sandiacre has been found guilty of hunting hares with a dog, following an incident on 12 December last year in Weston-on-Trent.

Thomas Stark, of Jackson Avenue, was found guilty during a trial at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates Court and was sentenced on Thursday, 18 August.

Stark was handed a five-year Criminal Behaviour Order which prohibits him from trespassing on private land with dogs. He was also ordered to pay more than Â£3700 in fines and costs and his dog was seized and made the subject of a forfeiture order, meaning it will be rehomed.
