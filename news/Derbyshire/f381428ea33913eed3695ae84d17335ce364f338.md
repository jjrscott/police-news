A 36-year-old man has been charged after an alleged disturbance at a house in Outram Road, Chesterfield in the early hours of yesterday morning (Tuesday, 30 July).

On attendance officers were deployed to a property in Chantrey Avenue and due to concerns for the safety of a man there, they used a 'flash bang' distraction device to allow them to enter.

The man was detained without injury and arrested.

Matthew Pearson, of Chantrey Avenue, Newbold has since been charged with affray, criminal damage to property, threatening to damage or destroy property, and assault by beating.

He has also been charged with being the owner of a dog dangerously out of control, which relates to an earlier alleged incident on the evening of Monday, 29 July in which a Dachshund was injured after being attacked by a Staffordshire Bull Terrier in Outram Road.

Mr Pearson was remanded into custody and is due to appear at Chesterfield Magistrates Court this morning.
