Tomorrow (Saturday) the whole of Derbyshire will be placed in the High tier of covid restrictions.

This means that no matter where you live or visit in the county you will have to abide by these, and other, restrictions:

 * you must not socialise with anybody outside of your household or support bubble in any indoor setting, whether at home or in a public place
 * you must not socialise in a group of more than 6 outside, including in a garden or other spaces like beaches or parks (other than where specific exemptions apply in law)

To find out the specific restrictions for Derbyshire you should visit the Government web page and ensure you know how to keep yourself and others safe: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/local-covid-alert-level-high

Today (Friday) Nottinghamshire has joined Greater Manchester and South Yorkshire in the Very High tier of restrictions.

Residents and businesses are subject to tighter restrictions and travel both in and out of the areas should not happen except for these specific reasons:

 * Travel to those very high-risk areas should be avoided unless for reasons such as work, education or youth services, to meet caring responsibilities or if you are travelling through as part of a longer journey.

Those living in Nottinghamshire must also not socialise with anybody they do not live with or have formed a support bubble with, in any indoor setting or in any private garden or at most outdoor hospitality venues and ticketed events.

Detective Chief Inspector Emlyn Richards, who is leading the response to coronavirus for Derbyshire Constabulary, said: "While I understand that these restrictions will cause significant disruption - I hope the move to a county-wide standard will mean things are clearer for those residents and businesses.

"The increasing infection rate in Derbyshire, and over the border in our neighbouring counties, is clearly concerning and we must all do our bit to help stop the spread of the virus.

"It is vital that everyone understands the various tiers and keeps up to date with the restrictions in any areas they may be visiting."
