Three teenagers have been arrested in connection with an alleged robbery where a dog was stolen in Derby.

A man was walking with a Yorkshire Terrier dog in the River Gardens at around 7.25 pm yesterday (Friday 26 February) when he noticed three people sat on a bench.

They allegedly approached the man, demanded cash, assaulted him and pulled him to the floor, before stealing the man's wallet and the dog and making off towards the bus depot.

Officers searched the area and arrested three teenage boys on suspicion of robbery on Traffic Street around 7.45 pm. They are currently in police custody.

The man suffered cuts and bruising to his face, and a fractured cheekbone and was taken to hospital for treatment. The dog has been reunited with her owner.
