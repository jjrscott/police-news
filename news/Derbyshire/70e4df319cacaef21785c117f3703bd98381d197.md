We're appealing for witnesses after officers we're called to a report of a disturbance in a Derby street yesterday evening (Sunday 29 March).

We received a call just before 5.50pm regarding a disturbance between people in two cars, a black Seat Leon and black Vauxhall Corsa, in Wolfa Street.

Officers attended and a 38-year-old man and a 25-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of public order offences.

We'd now like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or who was driving in the area at the time with dash cam installed.

If you have information which could help officers with their enquiries please contact us quoting reference number 20*168490.
