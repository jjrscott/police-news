A 15-year-old boy has been arrested after an assault in Long Eaton.

Officers were called to Tamworth Road, Long Eaton, at 6.35pm yesterday (Friday 8 May) to reports that a teenager had been assaulted by a group of other teenagers.

At the scene a 17-year-old was found with a number of injuries which, after he was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, for treatment, were found to be minor injuries.

It is understood at this time that the boy was assaulted but was not stabbed - contrary to reports on social media.

A 15-year-old boy from Long Eaton has been arrested on suspicion of assault and remains in custody.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who may have been in the area and witnessed the incident or anyone with CCTV or dashcam footage from the area at the time.
