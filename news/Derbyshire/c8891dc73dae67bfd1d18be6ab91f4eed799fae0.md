Officers investigating an incident where a woman was sexually assaulted in a Chesterfield street are appealing for the public's help.

The woman, who is in her 30s, was walking along Goyt Side Road between 4pm and 4.30pm on Saturday 1 August when she was approached by a man who asked her for money before sexually assaulting her once in Goytside Road and then again in Boythorpe Rise.

The man is described as white with short dark hair and spoke with an eastern European accent. He was wearing a red t-shirt and dark bottoms.

Officers want to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time and may have seen the man described above. They are also keen to hear from any drivers who may have dashcam that captured the area at the time.
