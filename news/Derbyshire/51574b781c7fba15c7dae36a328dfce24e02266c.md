Earlier this week we appealed to the public for help after two dogs were reported missing following a burglary at a car breakers in Allenton.

The two Akita dogs, who belonged to the business owner, have now been found believed to be safe and well and the owner is aware. Thank you to everyone who responded to our original appeal.

We are still keen to hear from anyone who may have been in the area at the time and noticed anything suspicious, or with information about the incident.

We received a call yesterday (Wednesday 13 January) to report that the business in Gosforth Road had been burgled overnight, and a substantial quantity of goods including tools and car parts had been stolen.

Two Akita dogs, who belonged to the business owner, were also missing from the premises.
