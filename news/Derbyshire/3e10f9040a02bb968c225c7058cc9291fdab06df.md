Chief Superintendent Hayley Barnett who is the Divisional Commander for North Division has today done a direct appeal to the community of Shirebrook to come forward with any information that may assist officers with their enquiries.

Andrew Jackson (55) was discovered at around 10am on Sunday 26 January at the allotment, off Prospect Drive.

Chief Superintendent Barnett said: "I would like to reassure the public that we have a dedicated team of specialist detectives working around the clock on this investigation.

"We also have police officers and police community support officers in the Model Village area of Shirebrook and I would encourage anyone to talk to them and pass on any information.

"We would like to build a picture of Mr Jackson's lifestyle and would like to speak to anyone who knew him to gain details of his associates and what areas he frequented."

Detective Inspector Chris Marriott who is the Senior Investigating Officer said: "My team would like anyone who heard a noise or a disturbance around the Prospect Drive area between 10.30pm on Saturday 25 January and 2am the next day to contact us.

"Inquiries have identified that several people were in Prospect Drive, Central Drive and surrounding streets between those times and we are asking them to come forward so we can speak to them as part of our investigation."
