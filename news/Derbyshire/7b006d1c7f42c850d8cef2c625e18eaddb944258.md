Four people have been arrested for allegedly committing drug-related offences following action taken by our Proactive Unit in Derby this morning.

Officers arrested a 30-year-old man in Rawdon Street after he was found in possession of more than 30 wraps of suspected heroin and crack cocaine. He was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply.

Meanwhile, during a warrant at a house in Clarence Road, officers from the team arrested an 18-year-old man and a 15-year-old boy on suspicion of committing the same offence.

Officers recovered what they believe to be drugs at the property.

A 57-year-old woman was also arrested at the house on suspicion of allowing the premises to be used for the supply of class A drugs.

All four remain in custody and are being questioned. The substances have been seized and will undergo testing to determine what they contain.
