We are releasing a CCTV image of a woman we would like to speak to after a woman was assaulted at a shop in Derby.

Do you recognise the woman in the CCTV image?

The incident took place between 9am and 9.30am on Thursday 27 August at the Matalan store at the Bradshaw Retail Park in the city.

A member of staff was allegedly pushed over and hit after trying to stop a woman she thought had been trying to leave without paying for a number of coats.

We think the woman in the pictures may have information which could help with our inquiries. Do you recognise her?
