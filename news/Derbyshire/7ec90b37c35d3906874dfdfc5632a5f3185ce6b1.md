Van owners are being urged to review their vehicle security in light of several thefts.

We have received reports in recent weeks of Ford Transit vans being stolen in the Chesterfield and Derby areas of the county, including Clay Cross, Shuttlewood, Ockbrook and Hilton.

Owners are being urged to consider taking the following steps to better secure their vans:

 * Park in a busy, well-lit area as most of the thefts have happened during the hours of darkness
 * Secure your van with a steering or handbrake lock
 * Park in an area where there is CCTV
 * If you have an invisible security device, such as a tracker or alarm, place a warning sticker on your van - it could be enough to put thieves off

PC Scott Jeffreys, of Roads Policing, said: "If you have your van stolen, it can often mean that you lose your livelihood, so we want to help owners better protect their vehicles."
