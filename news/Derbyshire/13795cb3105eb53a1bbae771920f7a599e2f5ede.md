Burglars have distracted pensioners in Littleover in order to steal from them.

We are investigating two crimes which happened on the evening of Wednesday 30 September.

At around 9.15pm two men visited a house in Elms Avenue, telling the 95-year-old homeowner they needed to check the fireplace and television. One man went into the lounge while the other stayed with the victim. It is not known at this time if anything has been stolen.

We are linking this to a similar incident which happened just after 10pm that night at a house in California Gardens. A man and a woman wearing face coverings visited a house and told the homeowner they were police officers carrying out local inquiries. Both entered the house and the 75-year-old victim later found her purse, containing cards and cash, was missing.

Officers are increasing patrols in the area and we are asking residents to be vigilant. If an unexpected visitor calls, claiming to be from a company or organisation, ask to see their identification and do not let them in. Genuine callers will be happy to wait outside while you call their employer to check their identification.

Witnesses or anyone with information should contact officer in the case DC Matt Watson via the below methods, quoting reference 20*515183 for the Elms Avenue crime and 20*515232 for the California Gardens burglary;
