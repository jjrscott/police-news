We are trying to find the rightful owners of two bikes, which we believe to have been stolen.

Officers say these two bikes were stolen in the early hours of Friday 13 December from Derby city centre.

We found two 15-year-old boys with the bikes and they have been arrested on suspicion of theft, questioned and released under investigation while inquiries continue.
