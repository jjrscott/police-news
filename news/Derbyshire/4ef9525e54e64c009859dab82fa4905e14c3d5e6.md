This weekend, a number of pubs across the county will re-open after almost 15 weeks of lockdown.

As much as we'd like it to be, the experience won't be one we recognise.

Please remember that social distancing rules continue to apply. You may be expected to queue outside venues or at the bar once you are inside and provide your details at each premises you visit to assist with test and trace.

We all have a responsibility to stop the spread of Coronavirus so please maintain a distance of two metres from those around you.

In this short video, Chief Inspector Becky Webster and Mike Kay, Head of Licensing at Derby City Council, discuss the extra steps that licensed premises across Derbyshire have had to take.

Staff at the Holly Bush Inn in Makeney let us in for a glimpse behind the scenes, showing how the pub experience has massively changed to ensure people can visit safely - with new measures such as face shields for bar staff now in place.

Covid-19 still presents a significant and deadly threat to public health. People should continue to wash their hands regularly and maintain social distancing.

Please reconsider your plans if you arrive somewhere and establish that distancing isn't achievable.

Be aware of how excess drinking and violent behaviour may impact the emergency services at this time.

Extra officers will be on patrol this weekend to make sure that people can enjoy the county's pubs, clubs and restaurants safely.

We want everyone to have a good time, but please do so safely, responsibly, and with respect for the public health measures in place.
