In 2015 a new criminal offence of controlling and coercive behaviour was created - but what is coercive and controlling behaviour, how can you spot the signs it may be happening to you or a loved one and where can you get help?

### **The definition of coercive and controlling behaviour
**

Coercive behaviour is an act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten an intimate partner, former partner or family member.

The behaviour seeks to make isolate the person and strip them of their independence, resistance, and chance of escape and regulate their everyday behaviour.

Behaviours that may be coercive and controlling are, but are not limited to:

 * Isolating you from friends and family
 * Depriving you of basic needs, such as food
 * Monitoring your time
 * Monitoring you via online communication tools or spyware
 * Taking control over aspects of your everyday life, such as where you can go, who you can see, what you can wear and when you can sleep
 * Depriving you access to support services, such as medical services
 * Repeatedly putting you down, such as saying you're worthless
 * Humiliating, degrading or dehumanising you
 * Controlling your finances
 * Making threats or intimidating you

The result of this type of domestic abuse can make you feel as though you are trapped in the relationship and held captive by the abuser - despite, potentially, there being nothing physically stopping you leaving the relationship.

Coercive and controlling behaviour can include elements of physical abuse; however, no physical abuse needs to have occurred for an offence to have taken place.

### **What to do if you are suffering from abuse or are worried about a loved one?**

Derbyshire Constabulary has officers dedicated to dealing with instances of domestic abuse; however, frontline officers are also taught to spot the signs of abuse.
