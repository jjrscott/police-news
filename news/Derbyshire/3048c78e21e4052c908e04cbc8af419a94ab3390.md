Safer Neighbourhood

09:06 24/12/2020

We've extended our PCSO recruitment campaign until 10 January - so there are now just a few days left to apply for one of the most varied and public-facing jobs in our force.

PCSOs are a key part of community policing and help us provide a stand-out service to the public of Derbyshire.

It's a varied and engaging role - one where no two days are the same, and where officers can make a huge difference to the lives of people living in our city, towns and villages.

Kerry Wallington-Waite is one of our longest-serving PCSOs, looking after Melbourne and the wider South Derbyshire area. She's also one of our first ever PCSO Supervisors - a role introduced by the force last year as part of our commitment to and investment in neighbourhood policing.

The role has given Kerry a fresh insight into the value of Safer Neighbourhood work, and reinforced her belief that the role of a PCSO is one of the most rewarding and challenging - and something she would urge anyone to do.

Find out more about the role and apply at www.careers.derbyshire.police.uk.
