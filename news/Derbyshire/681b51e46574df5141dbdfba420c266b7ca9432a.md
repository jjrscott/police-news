Officers are appealing for information after a man died in a collision near Tibshelf yesterday afternoon (Sunday, 29 September).

We were called to report a collision between a blue Ford Kuga and white Alfa Romeo Mito on the B6025 between Westhouses and Tibshelf just before 4.50pm. The Ford Kuga had left the road and was on its roof with the driver trapped inside. Officers attended alongside the Air Ambulance and East Midlands Ambulance Service, but the driver was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

Officers are now appealing for anyone who was travelling in the area at the time and witnessed the incident, or anyone with dash cam installed, to come forward.
