We're appealing for witnesses after a cyclist was found injured in Whaley Bridge yesterday evening (Monday 16 March).

Officers received a call from hospital staff at Salford Royal Hospital at 1.30am this morning (Tuesday 17 March) to say that a 50-year-old man had been brought in with serious injuries the night before.

The man was found in Macclesfield Road and an ambulance was called at around 8.15pm.

Officers are now working to establish the cause of man's injuries which although serious, are not understood to be life-threatening.

We know that a number of people stopped to assist the man, and would urge anyone who did to contact us.

We'd also like to hear from anyone who was driving nearby at the time and may have witnessed what happened, or anyone with dashcam or CCTV installed locally.

Anyone with information should get in touch quoting reference number 22 of 17 March.
