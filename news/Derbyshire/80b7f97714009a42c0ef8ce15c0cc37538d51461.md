Officers investigating an armed robbery in Old Whittington are appealing for information to help their investigation.

At around 7pm on Friday, 13 September, a man entered Netty's Convenience Store in Whittington Hill.

He demanded the shopkeeper open the till, threatened her with an imitation firearm and then stole the whole till (pictured below) before running left out of the shop and down Whittington Hill.

The man is described as around 5ft 8ins tall and of medium build. He was wearing a black beanie hat, a black shiny jacket and dark trousers.

The offender was also wearing what has been described as a "Halloween" mask of an old man and was also wearing black gloves.

The victim was not physically hurt in the incident.

Officers want to speak to anyone who has any information, was in the area at the time or who may have been driving in the area and have dashcam footage that shows the offender leaving the scene.
