A 16-year-old boy has been arrested after a CCTV image was released yesterday asking the public for help to identify the person pictured.

The appeal was released in relation to an allegation of sexual assault which was reported on 20 December last year in Mayfield Road in Ashbourne.

This report followed a number of other alleged incidents in the town in November and December last year.

Shortly after our appeal was released yesterday afternoon, a member of the public called in to identify the person in the image and he was subsequently arrested on suspicion of sexual assault. As such we'd like to thank everyone who shared our appeal.

The arrested teenager has now been released on police bail, whilst enquiries continue.
