We're appealing for the public's help following a report of an indecent exposure in Ilkeston yesterday (Tuesday 23 February).

A woman was running along the Nutbrook Trail, towards Quarry Hill, at around 12.40 pm when a man exposed himself to her.

The man was described as being white, aged in his 40s or 50s and around 5ft 5in. He was wearing blue jeans and a khaki jacket and was last seen heading towards a new housing estate on Elkas Rise.

There was an increased police presence in the area yesterday afternoon, and officers will continue patrols but would like to hear from anyone who may have seen a man matching this description in the area around the time.
