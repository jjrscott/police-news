Residents in the Ormsby Road area of Chesterfield will see an increased police presence as officers investigate an incident that took place in the early hours.

A man in his 30s arrived at Chesterfield Royal Hospital at 4.20am today (4 September) with serious injuries to his hand. It is believed that the incident occurred at an address in Ormsby Road - and residents will see an increased police presence in the area as enquiries continue.

Detectives are keen to speak to anyone who was in the area between 2am and 4am - in particular any drivers with dashcam that may have captured footage on the road between those times.

Chief Inspector Katie Andrews said: "There will be understandable concern from those residents in the Ormsby Road area given the large police presence.

"At this time detectives are working to understand exactly what has happened and officers will remain in the area for some time.

"You will also see an increase in high-visibility patrols in the area and, while there is not believed to be any wider risk to the public, I hope that this provides some reassurance for those who live locally.

"I would urge anyone who is concerned about this incident to speak to those officers and in particular if you have any information, no matter how small you think it may be, to contact us in confidence using any of the below methods."
