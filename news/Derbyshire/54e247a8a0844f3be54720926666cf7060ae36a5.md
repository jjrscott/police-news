Officers investigating a number of alleged burglaries in the Long Eaton area believe that a number of highly sentimental pieces of jewellery were sold in a local pawnbroker.

The five pieces, which all belong to elderly victims, were all sold at the Cash Monkey shop in High Street in late 2020 and early 2021.

The items are:

 * A 14ct gold chain sold sometime after the 25 November 2020
 * A 9ct gold earrings sold sometime after the 28 November 2020
 * A 9ct gold trilogy ring sold sometime after the 20 December 2020
 * A 9ct gold baby bangle sold sometime after the 6 January 2021
 * A 9ct gold chain sold sometime after the 7 January 2021

A Samsung J3 mobile phone, which is also believed to have been stolen, was sold from the same shop sometime after 13 January 2021.

Anyone who has purchased any of the items is asked to contact Derbyshire police. They will not be left out of pocket as they will be reimbursed by Cash Monkey for the items.
