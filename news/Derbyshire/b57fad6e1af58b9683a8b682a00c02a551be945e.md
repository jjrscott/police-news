A man has reported to a police station and a car has been seized following a collision in Bold Lane, Derby.

We issued an image yesterday of a car we were trying to trace in connection with the incident and last night, a 37-year-old man attended a police station in the city to speak to officers.

He has been questioned and inquiries continue.

The silver Mercedes C180 coupe we were looking for has been recovered.

At around 1pm on Tuesday, August 20, a 27-year-old man was walking along the pavement of Bold Lane when a car mounted the pavement and struck him.

The man remains in hospital in a serious condition.
