It's been a busy year in training school with eight cohorts of new recruits being sworn in this year. The last attestation of the year took place last night as our final group of new police constables were sworn in.

Last night (Thursday, 3 October) our newest officers were welcomed to the force by Assistant Chief Constable Paul Gibson and Police and Crime Commissioner Hardyal Dhindsa, with family and friends proudly watching on as they swore the oath of attestation at the very start of their policing careers.

Former special constables, PCSOs, RAF helicopter crew, radiographer, graduates and call handlers are just some of the many varied backgrounds.

They will now head out to join colleagues at stations in Derby, Peartree, Amber Valley, Matlock, Clay Cross, Ilkeston and Swadlincote for their probationary period.

It was a night they will never forget and we wish them all good luck!

The next cohort of new officers begins training in November and their attestation will take place in February.
