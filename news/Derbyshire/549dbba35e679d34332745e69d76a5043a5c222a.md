We were called by a resident concerned that people were not following coronavirus social distancing guidance yesterday (7 April) at around 4pm.

When officers attended the address in Chilham Way, Derby, three men were found inside - two did not live at the property and were told to leave.

The third man, the occupier of the house, was arrested on suspicion of production of a class B drug after a small suspected cannabis grow was found in the property.

The 30-year-old man has been released under investigation and enquiries continue.
