The family of a man who died after he was allegedly assaulted in Chesterfield at the weekend, have paid tribute to their "beautiful boy".

Joseph Robotham, 23, was taken to hospital after officers were called to an incident outside Vibe bar, in Holywell Street, at about 3.50am on Saturday 8 February.

The 23-year-old was allegedly struck over the head with a bottle and sadly died in hospital on Sunday night.

His family have paid tribute to Joseph by saying:

"Joseph was our beautiful boy, he was cruelly taken away from us.

"He was larger than life and had experienced the world.

"We love him so much, he will always be missed and will we never recover."

A 24-year-old man was charged with murder and possession of an offensive weapon yesterday (Monday 10 February).

Connor Rose, of no fixed abode, appeared at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates Court this morning and has been remanded into prison custody.

A second man, aged 28, was arrested on suspicion of affray and has been released on bail pending further enquiries.
