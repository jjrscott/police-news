The force currently has 21 serving canine officers, who are out on the front line each day protecting the citizens of Derbyshire.

A Police Dog will walk straight into a dangerous situation without hesitation and with unwavering loyalty, to sniff out illegal materials or bombs, track criminals, search buildings or help to find missing persons. The work of a police dog is vital and whilst they are out tackling crime and safeguarding our streets, it's of up most importance that, in return, we do all we can to shield our police dogs from harm in the line of duty.

Derbyshire Operations Trainers, Gemma Roberts and Simon Humphreys, are both canine first aid certified. They have been working diligently over the last three-months, developing a tailor made first aid course for our dog handlers, trainers and kennel staff. A series of intensive, interactive six-hour workshops have been taking place to provide our officers and staff with crucial knowledge, which will assist them with the skills and resources to care for police dogs, should they become ill or injured whilst working.

Dog Handler Lee Parkin said: "The canine first aid course has been a project in the making for a while, it's essential that handlers and instructors are trained appropriately to deal with immediate first aid treatment for our dogs. Not only to be prepared for incidents on the street, a prime example of this being retired PD Axle, who suffered three stab wounds while trying to detain a dangerous offender in 2018 - but incidents can occur in training, at home or with members of the public's dogs.

"The course will equip our officers and staff with invaluable resources and provide the knowledge and tools needed in identifying and treating issues before they become serious and can even save our four-legged partners life."

Since developing the course, the Operations team, have secured funding to provide each of the course attendees with a full canine first aid kit and medical supplies, along with providing all teams with tourniquets - which could be the difference between life and death in an emergency situation.

Whilst we hope these skills will not have to be put into practice, it will give our team the confidence and ability should any matters arise and give our dogs the protection they so rightly deserve.
