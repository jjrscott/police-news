Officers have identified a group of men from Leeds whom they believe may be responsible for starting a fire which destroyed an area of moorland.

Firefighters and officers were called at 8pm on Friday 10 April to reports of a moorland fire just off the A628 at Woodhead.

An area of about four hectares was burnt. It is believed the fire was started by a BBQ which had gotten out of control.

We have traced four men, all in their early 20s, who we believe were involved. They have been summonsed to court to face allegations under the new coronavirus legislation, namely that they were associating with people other than those in their own household and that their travel by car to Derbyshire was unnecessary.

An investigation into the fire is still ongoing.
