A man we want to speak to about an alleged assault in Chesterfield has been identified by members of the public responding to our appeal on Facebook.

We released images yesterday after a 23-year-old man reported being assaulted in the beer garden at Vibe in Holywell Street at around 4.30am on Sunday, July 28.

Thank you to those who came forward with information.
