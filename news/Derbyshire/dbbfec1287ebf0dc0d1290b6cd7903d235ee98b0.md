Officers investigating an alleged arson in Mickleover are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

We were called by Derbyshire Fire and Rescue to reports of a fire at a ground floor flat in Malham Road at 2.30pm Sunday, 8 September.

Officers were told that prior to the fire there had been an altercation and an 18-year-old was arrested in Derby that day on suspicion of assault and arson.

The teenager, who is from Derby, has been released on conditional police bail.
