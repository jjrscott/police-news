Residents in parts of Amber Valley are being urged to review their home and vehicle security following several crimes in recent weeks.

Officers in Heanor, Codnor and Belper say they have seen more burglaries and thefts from vehicles in these areas than usual.

Homeowners are being reminded to ensure windows and doors are locked at night and whenever you are leaving the property.

We are also asking motorists to make sure their vehicles are locked when not in use and to make sure they are empty of tools and anything else of value, such as wallets, handbags and phones.

Please park in a garage, if you have access to one, or try to park somewhere well-lit.
