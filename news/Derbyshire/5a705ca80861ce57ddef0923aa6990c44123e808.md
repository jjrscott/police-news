Three youngsters have had their bicycles stolen from them at a Derby park.

At around 4pm on Wednesday 21 October, three 13-year-old boys were in West Park Meadows, Spondon, with their bicycles.

They were approached by a group of six or seven youths, who threatened the boys. They stole two of the bikes before leaving.

The victims have been able to describe the robbers. One is aged about 15, 5ft 2ins tall and slim. He wore a grey and white camouflage pattern hoody, dark blue balaclava and black Nike gloves.

Another robber is white, aged about 17 and around 5ft 10ins tall. He is of medium build and wore black clothes and a disposable face mask.

A third robber is mixed race, aged around 15 and 5ft 4ins tall. He is chubby and wore a blue and white motorcross helmet and black jacket.

Shortly before this, another teenager was in the area when he was approached by a group wearing balaclavas and masks. He handed them his bike helmet before they walked off.
