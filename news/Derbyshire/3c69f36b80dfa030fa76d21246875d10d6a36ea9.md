Two people have been charged after allegedly breaching COVID laws by attending a gathering.

Officers visited a house in Bradwell on the evening of Saturday 27 February and found a group of people at the property who they believed were not all from the same household.

Eight fixed penalty notices were issued to people at the house.

Gary (63) and Nikki (58) Hall, of Netherside, Bradwell, were both later charged with obstructing a constable in the execution of their duty and participating in a gathering of two or more people in a private dwelling.

They are due before magistrates in Chesterfield later this month.
