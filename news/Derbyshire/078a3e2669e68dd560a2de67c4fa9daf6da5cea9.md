We'd like to take a moment to thank our Volunteers, Special Constables and Police Cadets for their work during what has been, and continues to be, a challenging year.

This year we have seen an incredible amount of support from the Special Constabulary, Police Officers that give their time freely as volunteers to serve the public of Derbyshire. An outstanding total of 22,810 hours have been worked from the start of the pandemic to date, and their contribution has been invaluable.

Their hard work to support frontline colleagues at times of need does not go unnoticed, and we would like to say thank you.

Assistant Chief Constable Michelle Shooter said: "I'm sure that some of our volunteers aren't done yet for the year, and will be spending time away from their families this year during the festive period.

"Our Special Constabulary give their time freely so that the people of Derbyshire can enjoy their holidays safe in the knowledge that we are watching over them in the background, and for this I offer my sincerest thanks."

Derbyshire Police and Crime Commissioner Hardyal Dhindsa said: "I have often said how incredibly proud and grateful I am for all those who work within the Derbyshire policing family, in whatever capacity.

"When I heard about the incredible work the Special Constabulary have been undertaking during the Covid-19 pandemic, I felt it was important that I give my personal thanks to them for their continued support and how they have helped support the vital work of the police during this global emergency."

Please join us in thanking and wishing all of our Special Constabulary, Volunteers, and Cadets, a very Merry Christmas and a Happy and Safe New Year for 2021.
