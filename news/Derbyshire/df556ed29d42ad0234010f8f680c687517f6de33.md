Officers investigating a collision in which a driver left the scene are appealing for the public's help to trace the vehicle involved.

At 9.20pm on Thursday, 26 March, the victim, a 48-year-old woman, was driving along Moorbridge Lane in Stapleford.

The bridge, which is within the Derbyshire boundary, is currently undergoing repair work and only one lane is operating which is traffic light controlled.

The victim was driving through on a green light when a red coloured car drove towards her at speed and the two vehicles collided. The red car did not stop and drove off in the direction of Sandiacre.

The woman was left with minor injuries and was badly shaken.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who may have been in the area at the time, in particular drivers who may have caught the incident or the red car on dashcam. They also like to hear from anyone who may have seen a vehicle matching this description with substantial damage to its front.
