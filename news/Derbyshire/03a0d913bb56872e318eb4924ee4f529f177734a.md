Further to our earlier release about an incident at a shop on Normanton Road we have received further information to link this to a burglary.

The Guru Arjan Dev Ji Sikh Gurdwara on Stanhope Street was broken into and we believe the assault and break in are linked.

We were called just before 8.40am with reports of the break in, which is understood to have happened sometime in the early hours.

A man who was earlier arrested in connection with the assault in Normanton Road has also been arrested on suspicion of burglary in relation to this incident.

We would like to reassure the local community that our investigations into both incidents continue and we do not believe there to be any one else involved.

Superintendent Gareth Meadows said: "I would like to thank the Sikh community and the local people in Normanton for their assistance with our enquiries. Our officers remain in the area, if you have any information in relation to these two incidents please speak to the officers or contact us using the methods stated."

Anyone with information about either incident can contact us by using one of the methods below.

Please quote reference number 249 of 25 May for the break in and 257 of 25 May for the stabbing.
