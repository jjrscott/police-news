A man has tragically died after he was struck by a lorry at Boundary, near Swadlincote.

We received a call just after 5.45am to the A511 Ashby Road to reports of a collision between a lorry and a pedestrian.

Both police and ambulance crews attended, and the road was closed while investigations were carried out.

The man's family have been informed and our thoughts are with them at this sad time.

Our officers would like to hear from anyone on the A511 with dashcam footage, or any witness who may have seen a pedestrian walking along that stretch of road around the time of the incident to get in touch.
