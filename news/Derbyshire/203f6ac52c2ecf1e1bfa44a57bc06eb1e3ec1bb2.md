A man suffered a dislocated elbow and fractured forearm when he was robbed by a gang in Derby.

At 11.30pm on Thursday 26 March, a 33-year-old man was chased down Western Road and Temple Street by a group of three or four men.

They assaulted him and took his bag.

He has described the group as black, of athletic build and all wearing dark clothing. One wore a cap and had a distinct pattern on the upper part of his jacket, shoulders and zip.

This is of mixed race and had light stubble beard.

Anyone who saw or heard anything, or may have CCTV footage from 11:15pm until midnight from Western Road, Temple Street or Providence Street, should contact Detective Staff Investigator Umer Iqbal and quote reference 20*164868.
