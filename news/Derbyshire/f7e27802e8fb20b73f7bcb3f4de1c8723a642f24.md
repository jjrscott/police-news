Detectives investigating three robberies against pensioners in Derby believe they are linked.

The latest robbery happened at about 10.30am today (January 4) when an 80-year-old man was walking along Phoenix Street. He was robbed by two Asian youths, who took his wallet. A passer-by came to the victim's aid and chased the robbers off before calling police.

The victim suffered facial injuries and is currently in hospital.

We are linking this robbery to another which happened at around 8.45pm last night (Friday 3 January) on Forester Street.

A 73-year-old man was approached from behind by a youth, who pushed him over and took his wallet. A passer-by stopped to help the victim and call police.

We believe the robber had followed the victim as he walked to Forester Street from Normanton Road.

At 7.30pm on New Year's Eve, an 82-year-old woman was robbed in Osmaston Road as she walked towards the city centre. She was approached by a group of four Asian youths. One of them took her phone from her pocket.

A group of four men came to her aid and two of them ran after the group of youths, along Hartington Street, while the other two men took the victim home.

We are keen to trace these four Good Samaritans and are asking them to come forward.

Victims and witnesses in these cases have described an Asian youth, thought to be in his mid-teens, who wore a bright red jacket.

We want to hear from any witnesses, or anyone who was driving in the area of these robberies at the time who might have dash cam footage of a youth or group of youths acting suspiciously.
