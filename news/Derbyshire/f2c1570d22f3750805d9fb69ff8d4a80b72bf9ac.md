Officers continue to investigate the circumstances around a flat fire in which a woman died.

We were called to a block of flats in Seaton Court, Devonshire Close, Newbold, just before 9pm on Saturday 12 September.

A 34-year-old woman sadly died at the scene. We believe the fire was started by a naked flame and our investigations are ongoing.

We would like to thank those members of the public who have come forward with information to date and ask anyone who is yet to speak to us to get in touch.
