This afternoon we're hosting a live question and answer session on Domestic Abuse.

Specialist officers from our Domestic Abuse unit and our partners from the Elm Foundation will be around between 1pm and 3pm to talk to anyone with concerns about the issue.

You can find out what is considered to be Domestic Abuse, and what support is available or ways to report, whatever your question, our officers will do their best to answer.

To join in and take part, go to https://www.sli.do/ and enter the event code **#YouAreNotAlone**. Questions can be asked anonymously or privately.

The Q&A sessions were set up earlier in the year and take place every month.
