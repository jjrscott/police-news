Officers investigating a collision on the A52 in which a man and woman died are appealing for information to help their enquiries.

The incident occurred on the westbound carriageway of the A52 just after the junction for the M1 at 4.55pm on Saturday 22 August where a white Vauxhall Insignia left the road before colliding with a tree.

Both the driver, a 37-year-old man from Derby, and the passenger, a 29-year-old woman from Stapleford, were pronounced dead at the scene. The families of both of the deceased are aware and our thoughts are with them at this time.

Officers from Derbyshire police's collision investigation unit want to hear from anyone who was in the area and may have witnessed the incident, or the moments before it. Of particular interest are any drivers who have dashcam footage that may have captured the car in the moments before the incident.
