An Alfreton man was arrested after racist Facebook posts were made during Derby County's victory against Millwall yesterday.

A number of comments of an abusive nature were reported to us on the evening of Saturday 5 December.

We arrested a 25-year-old man on suspicion of racially aggravated public order offences late last night.

He remains in police custody this morning.
