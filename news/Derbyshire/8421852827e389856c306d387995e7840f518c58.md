Our detectives are appealing for witnesses after burglars stole a large amount of cigarettes in a ram raid at a Dronfield convenience store.

The offenders reversed a car into the shutters at the McColl's shop, off Green Lane/Stonelow Road, just before midnight on Thursday 12 November.

Three people wearing face coverings then forced the shutters open and climbed inside, where they stole the cigarettes and tried to get into a cash machine - which they failed to do.

They then drove off in a Citroen Picasso.

Did you witness the ram raid? Were you driving in the area around the time with a dashcam device, that may have filmed the vehicle, or do you have private CCTV that may have recorded it?
