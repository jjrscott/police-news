Officers are appealing for the public's help after three high value motorcycles were stolen during a burglary in Derby.

The incident took place between 8.30pm and 8.50pm yesterday evening (Thursday 30 April).

Three men, who were travelling in a white Ford Transit, forced their way into the business in Alfreton Road, Derby, and stole three high value motorcycles - a Ducati 1299 Panigale, a Honda CBR 1000RA and a Yamaha MT10.

The men loaded the bikes into the back of the van and then drove off from the scene.

Officers are following a number of enquiries in relation to the incident and are keen to speak to anyone who was in the area and might be able to help the investigation.

Of particular interest are any drivers who were in the area at between 8pm and 9pm and may have footage that captures the van in the area.
