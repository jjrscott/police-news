Our roads policing crew will be taking to your screens tonight in the first episode of the new Traffic Cops.

Late last year, our officers climbed behind the wheel with camera crews, who filmed 24/7 to capture the wide variety of crimes and incidents RPU deals with.

Tonight's episode - which airs at 9pm on Channel 5 - showcases some of that action.

And although live pursuits and dramatic arrests feature in tonight's episode, the series shows that the roads policing unit deals with much more than just traffic.

The rest of the first series is due to air later this summer.
