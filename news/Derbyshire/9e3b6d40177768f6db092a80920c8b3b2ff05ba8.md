Residents have been allowed back in to their properties at a block of flats in Newbold after they were evacuated following an incident early this morning.

Emergency services and the Ministry of Defence attended the flats off Devonshire Close, after we received a call at 2am about concerns of safety for a man.

A device was found in an outhouse at the rear of the flats and the area was made safe and the device destroyed.

A 25-year-old man was arrested and has now been released on police bail.
