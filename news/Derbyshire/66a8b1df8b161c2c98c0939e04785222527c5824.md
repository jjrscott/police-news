A few months ago we told you about Police Cadet Nicole Lander, who was selling her personalised artwork to raise money for the NHS.

In the past week Nicole announced the total from her artwork sales and has donated the money and an art piece to Chesterfield Royal Hospital.

Nicole sold just over 180 hand drawn replicas of the original 'key workers artwork', raising an incredible total of Â£2,150.

She said: "It's amazing to know that you can make a difference, just from the comfort of your own home and with things you currently own! It took me more than 240 hours to complete all orders, and it was an honour to have spent my time creating each personalised piece, spreading love and happiness to those who are supporting us each and every day."

Nicole had requests not just from Chesterfield or Derbyshire, but she also posted her artwork to people in Huddersfield, Northampton, Bristol, Bournemouth, Newcastle, London... the list goes on!

The money will be used towards bringing health and well-being experiences to Chesterfield Royal Hospital and Primary Care Staff, as well as to help enhance care and facilities for patients.

We are all very proud of Nicole and wish her all the best for her future.
