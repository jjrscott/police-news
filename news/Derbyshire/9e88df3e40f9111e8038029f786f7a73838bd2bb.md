A man has been arrested in connection with an aggravated burglary in Ilkeston.

Earlier this week, we told you that officers had been called to a house in Manor Road at around 9.40pm on Monday 21 December.

Three men entered the house, allegedly threatened a 27-year-old man, and stole a phone and cash before leaving in a grey coloured car.

Nottinghamshire Police arrested a man in Bestwood on our behalf late last night.

The 25-year-old was arresting on suspicion of aggravated burglary and criminal damage and he remains in custody.
