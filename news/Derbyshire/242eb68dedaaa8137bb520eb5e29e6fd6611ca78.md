A motorcyclist is in a critical condition following a collision this evening.

We were called to Makeney Road, Duffield, at about 6.15pm following reports that a motorbike and a car had collided.

The rider of the black KTM has been taken to hospital, where he remains in a critical condition. The driver of the black Volkswagen Passat was uninjured.

Makeney Road is closed between Derby Road and Duffield Bank and we expect it to remain closed for several hours while we investigate.

Witnesses to the incident, or anyone who saw either vehicle prior to the collision, are asked to come forward. We also want to speak to anyone who was driving in the area at the time who has dashcam footage.
