A man has sadly died following a serious assault in Killamarsh last night (Monday 29 March).

Police were called to reports of a disturbance at a house on Westthorpe Road around 10 pm.

A man was then found injured near the junction of Westthorpe Road and Upperthorpe Road and was treated by paramedics, before being taken to hospital, where he later died.

Officers have now launched a murder investigation. A scene is still in place on Westthorpe Road which will remain closed at this time.

Residents will see an increased number of officers in the area but we would like to reassure people that we believe this to be an isolated incident.

Anyone who has concerns and wishes to speak to police are encouraged to talk to officers in the area.

We would also like to hear from witnesses or anyone who was driving in the area at the time who has dashcam footage.
