Detectives leading a murder investigation have made several further arrests in connection with an alleged incident in Chaddesden on Saturday evening (April 20).

Officers were called to Chaddesden Lane at 9.45pm and on arrival found a man injured in a car park, near to Chaddesden Park. The man, who was 57, was taken to hospital where he sadly died a short time later.

Today, two 19-year-old men and a 21-year-old woman have been arrested on suspicion of murder.

A 16-year-old girl, a 19-year-old man and a 26-year-old man have also been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.

The 16-year-old boy who was arrested yesterday has been released without charge and Detectives have eliminated him from their enquiries.

Chaddesden Lane was closed from the junction of Tudor Road following the incident, as a scene was in place, but this has now been released and the road has reopened.

Detective Inspector, Chris Marriott, who is leading the investigation said:
"This is still very much a live investigation and our enquiries are ongoing.

"As such, we would urge anyone with any information to contact us at the earliest opportunity.
