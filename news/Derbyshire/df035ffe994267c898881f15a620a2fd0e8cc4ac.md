"They shall not grow old as we that are left grow old, age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn them. At the going down of the sun and in the morning, we will remember them."

Across the country today, we should be standing shoulder to shoulder with our parents, grandparents and war veterans, paying our respects to the men, women, children and animals that lost their lives during the wars.

At the end of October, and before current restrictions came into place, Chief Constable Rachel Swann met with Chief Fire Officer Gavin Tomlinson, Police and Crime Commissioner Hardyal Dhindsa, the force Chaplain and Police Dog Akira to lay a wreath.

Mrs Swann said: "With all that is going on in the world at the moment, it is good to be able to pause today, and take time to remember those who gave their lives in past Wars.

"Every year we remember them, and this year will be no different. On both Sunday and Wednesday, I invite all to join me in two minutes silence at 11am. We will remember them."
