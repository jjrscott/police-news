We are investigating an incident where a taxi driver was racially abused by a man who tried to assault him.

A 47-year-old taxi driver was stopped at traffic lights near the Cockpitt island in Derby, near the turning for the bus station, when the driver in the car behind stopped and got out of his vehicle, which was a black Hyundai Accent.

The taxi driver says the man approached his window and was racially abusive. He tried to punch him through the window and then punched the wing mirror off.
