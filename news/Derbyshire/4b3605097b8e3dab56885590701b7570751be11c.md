Two women have sadly died following a collision this morning (Wednesday 7 October) in Renishaw.

We were called to the A6135 Station Road just before 5.40am today (Wednesday 7 October) following reports of a collision involving a blue Vauxhall Corsa and a blue BMW.

The women, who were travelling in the Corsa, died at the scene of the incident.

A man has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.

The road was closed between Renishaw and Eckington while we carried out investigative work and it re-opened just before 3pm.

Anyone who may have witnessed the incident, may have seen the vehicles before the collision or with any dashcam or CCTV footage, should contact us quoting reference 101 of 7 October.
