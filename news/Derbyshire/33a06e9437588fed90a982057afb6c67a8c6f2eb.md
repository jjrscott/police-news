Following enquiries by officers in relation to the reported incident of attempted dog theft in Greenwich park, Ripley, on 21 March it has been found this was not as first reported.

The person who called police in connection to this is receiving support and we would ask people not to speculate or comment in relation to the circumstances.

Understandably people have been extremely concerned about what was reported as dog thefts have been increasingly highlighted on social media recently. While the number of dog thefts in Derbyshire are very low, we understand the impact this type of crime has on those involved.
