Derby has been chosen to be one of the few cities across the country to host the National Monument against Violence and Aggression otherwise known as the 'Knife Angel' the spectacular 27ft sculpture, made-up of 100,000 bladed weapons handed in as part of police surrender schemes across the country.

Early tomorrow morning, weather permitting, the Angel will be carefully put in place outside Derby Cathedral by a team of workers who are part of a small group of businesses who have offered their time and expertise for free.

Rachel Morris, CEO of Derby Cathedral and Chair of the Derby Knife Angel Steering Group, said: "We seem to have been working on this project for a long time and we are now all very excited that the Knife Angel is nearly here.

"The sculpture is designed to be a symbol for the pain, feelings and loss that family and friends of victims of violent crime can experience and to shine a light on the futility of such actions.

"It is a spectacular sight and we hope as many people as possible come and visit and learn how we can all work together to reduce knife and violent crime.

"I want to thank everyone involved in bringing the Knife Angel to Derby, particularly the hundreds of volunteers who have come forward to act as marshals and the local companies who have given up their time and expertise."

The sculpture will be on display next to Derby Cathedral on Irongate, Derby, between Tuesday, 1st October and Wednesday, 30th October.
