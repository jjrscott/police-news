Two men have been arrested in connection with the alleged firing of a gun in a Littleover road.

Police were called to Moorway Lane just before 6pm on Tuesday 12 May to reports that a firearm had been discharged during a dispute between two groups of men.

The two groups were then reported to have fled the scene at speed in separate cars.

A number of arrests have been made over the last few days by a team of detectives investigating the incident - with two more being made today.

A 33-year-old man was arrested in High Wycombe this morning on suspicion of possessing a firearm.

Additionally, a 22-year-old man handed himself into police in Derby in the early hours of this morning and was arrested on suspicion of the same offence. Both men remain in police custody.

Their arrests bring the total to seven, with four men arrested on Tuesday, and another on Wednesday. Those men have been bailed or released under investigation while our investigation continues.

We want to reiterate our appeal for witnesses and would like to hear from any drivers who were in the Moorway Lane area last night with dashcam footage.

If you can help, call us on 101 and quote reference 20*240776.

You can also call Crimestoppers and give information anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
