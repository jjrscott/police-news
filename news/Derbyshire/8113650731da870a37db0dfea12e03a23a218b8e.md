A man in his 80s has been robbed by two men who lured him out of his house.

At around 5pm on Tuesday 25 August, an 82-year-old man was at his home in Newbridge Street, Old Whittington, when two men came to the house.

They told him his car was damaged and encouraged him to come and look. When he left the house, one of the men grabbed him while the other took his watch from his wrist.

Both men are white and the one who grabbed him is in his late 30s, about 5ft 9ins tall and wore a dirty coat.

The man who stole his watch is in his early 20s, was shorter than his accomplice and also wore a coat.

The victim was left shaken by the incident.
