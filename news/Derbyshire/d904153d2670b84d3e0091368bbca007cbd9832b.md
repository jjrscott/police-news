Today we are celebrating the life and legacy of Stephen Lawrence from south-east London, who was murdered in an unprovoked racist attack on 22 April 1993.

Stephen and his friend were waiting at a bus stop when they were approached by a group of men shouting racist abuse. Stephen was stabbed twice and killed by the attackers. After the initial police investigation, five suspects were arrested but none were convicted.

An inquiry into the handling of Stephen's case was held in 1998, this led to the publication of the Macpherson Report, which has been called 'one of the most important moments in the modern history of criminal justice in Britain'.

In Derbyshire Constabulary we value people and their differences. We continue to aim to have a fully representative and diverse workforce helping to make our society a fairer place.

We are joining in with the #BecauseOfStephen campaign today, where officers are supporting messages from Stephen's legacy, including how they have the motivation to succeed, and how they feel empowered to reach their potential.

We hope you will join us today in remembering Stephen.

#SLDay #LiveOurBestLife
