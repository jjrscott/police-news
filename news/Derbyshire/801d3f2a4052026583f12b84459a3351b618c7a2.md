Three men have been arrested on suspicion of possessing cannabis with intent to supply.

Officers from the Proactive Unit saw a man yesterday (Tuesday 31 March) who they believed to be acting suspiciously in Derby. They stopped him and found him to be carrying suspected cannabis. He was arrested.

The investigation led them to his home in Meynell Street, Normanton, where they found a large amount of cash and more suspected cannabis.

Two men found at the house were also arrested.

The three men, aged 23, 27 and 30 were questioned by detectives and have now been released under investigation.
