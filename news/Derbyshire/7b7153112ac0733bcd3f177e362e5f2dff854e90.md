Six people have been arrested on suspicion of drugs offences following a day of action in Shirebrook.

Shirebrook Safer Neighbourhood Team has launched an operation alongside officers from our Tactical Crime Unit and Organised Criminal Gang Team to tackle the supply of illegal substances in the town.

They executed four warrants at houses across the town, arresting four men and two women on suspicion of conspiracy to supply class A drugs. Cash and suspected drugs were also recovered during the warrants, along with two batons.

The men, aged 28, 31, 37 and 44, and the women, aged 21 and 30, remain in custody and are being questioned.

Sgt Mark Church, of Shirebrook Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: "These warrants are part of an operation we have been planning for several months.

 "Drug dealing will not be tolerated in our town. It impacts on communities and it can have a devastating impact on those addicted to illegal substances."
