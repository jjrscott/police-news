Two men are in custody after officers followed a lorry they believed to have been stolen.

Shortly before 4am today (Tuesday 6 October), a Derbyshire Roads Policing officer was on the northbound carriageway of the M1, between junctions 26 and 27, when he saw a lorry he believed to have been stolen.

He followed the lorry and radioed for other units to join him. The lorry left the northbound carriageway at junction 30, but turned onto the southbound exit slip road, driving in the wrong direction.

It stopped just before reaching the main carriageway and officers saw people run away from the cab towards Barlborough.

Two men, aged 24 and 30 and from Sheffield, were arrested nearby on suspicion of stealing a motor vehicle.

The lorry is thought to have been stolen from York last month and inquiries are ongoing.
