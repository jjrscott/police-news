A man has been charged in connection with an alleged sexual assault in Alvaston, Derby.

Kevin Tomlinson, 48, of Hall Street, Alvaston, has been charged with assault by penetration and appeared before Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court today where he was remanded in prison.

Officers were called to reports that, at around 8.30pm on Friday 15 November, a 60-year-old woman was walking along the footpath that runs between Thorndike Avenue and Baker Street when a man approached her and sexually assaulted her.
