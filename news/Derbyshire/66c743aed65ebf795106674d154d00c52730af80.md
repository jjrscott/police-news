We're releasing an image of two stolen canoe boats in the hope that someone may have been offered similar items for sale and could assist with our enquiries.

We're releasing an image of two stolen canoe boats in the hope that someone may have been offered similar items for sale and could assist with our enquiries.

The boats, which are Old Town Canadian canoes, are dark green in colour and were stolen from outside a house in London Road, Shardlow.

It is thought that the boats may have been stolen to sell on and that they could have been advertised for sale.

The theft happened sometime between 10-13 November and officers have been pursuing a number of other lines of enquiry during this time.
