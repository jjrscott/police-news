Five men have been arrested after suspected Cannabis grows were found at three addresses in Hasland, Chesterfield and Brimington.

Officers executed a warrant at an address in Calow Lane, Hasland at around 11am on 21 January and discovered the first grow. Two men, a 53-year-old from Durham and a 55-year-old from Chesterfield, were arrested.

A third man, aged 42 and from Chesterfield, was also arrested in connection with the incident on 6 February.

Later that day, at around 12.50pm officers received a report about a suspected Cannabis grow in Meltham Lane, Chesterfield and on arrival found a number of plants. A 23-year-old man from Leicester was arrested.

On 28 January, officers attended an address in Cornwall Drive, Brimington after receiving a report that there had been electricity issues at a neighbouring property. On arrival they found a third large cannabis grow and arrested a 44-year-old man from Sheffield.

All of those arrested have since been released under investigation, pending further enquiries.

We're currently sharing the work we do across our varied communities as part of Operation Derbyshire.

Operation Derbyshire runs until the end of May. It will see officers and staff sharing with our communities the excellent work that is going on to tackle certain crime types in the county.

Operation Derbyshire will also highlight the work that we and our partners do to support victims and bring offenders to justice.
