A murder investigation has been launched in Langley Mill after officers were called to a house in the early hours of this morning.

We were called to a property on Frost Avenue in the town at around 2am today, Friday 3 April.

On arrival the body of a man was found and he was pronounced dead at the scene.

A 28-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder and she remains in police custody.

We are treating this as an isolated incident and our investigations are still in the early stages as we work to establish the facts.

There will be an increased police presence in the area and a scene remains in place.
