Officers investigating a serious assault in Derby are appealing for drivers with dashcam footage to come forward to assist in their enquiries.

The incident took place following a gathering at a house in Patmore Square, Sunny Hill, at around 5.30am on the morning Saturday 29 August.

A 29-year-old man received a number of stab wounds during the incident before being taken to hospital where he remains in a stable condition.

At the time of the incident a large number of cars were understood to be in the area and officers are keen to speak to any drivers who may have dashcam that captured the incident itself, of the moments before or after it took place.

Detective Chief Inspector Harry Rai said: "A team of detectives are currently working on a number of lines enquiry - including CCTV footage - and a number of leads are being followed.

"These types of incident are understandably concerning for the communities in which they take place and I would like to reassure those who live in the area that this is believed to be an isolated incident with no risk to the public.

"With that being said patrols are being stepped up in the area, both in uniform and in plain clothes, and if you have any information or concerns then please speak to the officers or contact us using any of the below methods."
