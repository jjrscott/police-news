We are asking for witnesses to come forward following reports of a car being driven at pedestrians outside the Mackworth Community Centre.

The incident is alleged to have happened on Prince Charles Avenue, Mackworth, Derby at around 8.30pm on Friday, 10 July.

It is reported that a silver Vauxhall Zafira was deliberately driven at a group of six people who were standing outside the community centre.

A 26-year-old man from Derby has been interviewed about the incident and the officer dealing with the incident would now like to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time and saw what happened.

Detective Constable Natalie Barnett said: "No one was injured as a result of the driver's actions however it must have been frightening for those involved.

"We have interviewed the driver, but would now really like to speak to anyone else who was in the area and saw what happened."
