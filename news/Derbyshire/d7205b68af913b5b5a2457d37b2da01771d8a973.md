Officers investigating an alleged assault in Derby are appealing for phone footage to help their investigation.

The assault is believed to have happened at around 12.45pm on Tuesday, June 18, in Peet Street, near to Lavistock Court.

A 32-year-old man reported he was walking along Peet Street when a man he knew approached and spoke briefly to him. An altercation then took place, which led to the victim being assaulted and thrown to the ground.

The injured man suffered cuts, grazes and bruising to his head and body which did not require hospital treatment.

Several people were seen recording the incident on their phones, and we would like them to come forward so officers can view that footage.

Any footage that may be of use to officers should be downloaded onto another device and safely kept for officers to view.
