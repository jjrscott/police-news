Drivers in the High Peak, particularly those who own vans, are being urged the improve their vehicle security.

Officers are investigating incidents where thieves have broken into homes in order to take van or car keys and then steal the vehicle.

Three youths have been arrested in connection with the theft of a car from a home in Marsh Way, Chapel-en-le-Frith on Tuesday 24 November and inquiries are ongoing.

We are offering this advice for drivers:

 * Consider fitting a steering lock. A thief broke into a home in Holmfield, Buxton, during the early hours of Monday 30 November. They stole keys to the van parked on the driveway but because the van was fitted with a steering lock, they were unable to take the vehicle.
 * Park your vehicle in a locked garage, if you are able to, or park in a well-lit area.
 * Make sure your vehicle is locked when unattended and lock your house windows and doors at night

We are investigating these crimes and patrols in the High Peak have been increased. If you see anyone acting suspiciously in your area, please contact the police with descriptions of the people, or any vehicles they may be using.
