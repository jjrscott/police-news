Officers investigating the theft of eight dachshunds are appealing for help tracing three people seen in the area at the time.

The dogs, which were stolen from a property in Burton Road, Acresford, near Swadlincote, are pedigree show dogs and worth a substantial amount of money.

The three male and five female dogs, which are all miniature wire-haired dachshunds, were taken from the property at around 11.10pm on Wednesday 10 February.
