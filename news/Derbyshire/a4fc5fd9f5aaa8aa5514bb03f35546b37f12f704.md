A pensioner has been robbed in Derby.

At around 8.45pm last night (Friday 3 January), a 73-year-old man was robbed on Forester Street.

He was approached from behind by a youth, pushed over and his wallet taken. A passer-by stopped to help the victim and call police.

We believe the robber had followed the victim as he walked to Forester Street from Normanton Road.

The person who robbed him is described as being in his mid-teens, about 5ft 5ins tall and wearing a red jacket.

DS Steve Judge said: "The victim in this case suffered facial injuries when he fell. Street robbery is a serious crime and we are asking people to be vigilant and report anything suspicious to us."
