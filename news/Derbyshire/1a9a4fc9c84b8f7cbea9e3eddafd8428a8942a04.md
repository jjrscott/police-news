One of our officers from the Derby City Centre Safer Neighbourhood Team has released CCTV images after a burglary at a bike shop.

The incident happened last month in the early hours of Wednesday, 2 October when two bikes, similar to those pictured, were stolen from Bikeworks on Full Street, Derby.

We think that the man captured in the pictures may be the same person, do you recognise him?

If so please contact us.

We would also like to hear from anyone who has been offered a bike similar to those pictured for sale.

If you think you can help, please make contact with the officer investigating the break-in, PC Mike Novak, using any of the following non-emergency contact methods and quoting reference number 19*524853:
