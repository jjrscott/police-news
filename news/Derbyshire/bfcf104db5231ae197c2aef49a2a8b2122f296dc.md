Safer Neighbourhood

16:02 24/10/2019

Officers from our Mackworth Safer Neighbourhood Team have seized a motorbike after it was seen causing anti-social behaviour in the Derby suburb.

The incident happened on Prince Charles Avenue at around 5pm, earlier this week on Tuesday 22 October.

The bike (pictured) was seized as no insurance was recorded.

PCSO Dorota Nastaj, from the team, said: "We are receiving complaints from residents about motorbikes being driven erratically and causing a danger and anti-social behaviour.

"We are working hard to try and prevent this from happening so we were pleased to be able to take this bike off the road.

"I would encourage residents to help us to help them by making contact with us to let us know who the people are who are taking part in this behaviour, as it is clear that they will be seeing them leave and return to their houses with these bikes.

"I would also give a message to the young people that are taking part in such behaviour, that as well as the risk to their and other people's safety they are risking receiving points on their licence and a ban before they are even able to get a driving licence, something they will later regret."
