Officers want to speak to this man in connection with the theft of a bank card in Chesterfield on Thursday, 22 August.

The victim, a 77-year-old woman from Bakewell, was using her card to pay at the self-service checkouts at the Morrison's store in Chatsworth Road when she noticed a man stood very close to her.

The woman returned to her car, placed her items inside and returned the trolley. As she made her way back she was approached by a well-dressed Italian man who said he was unwell and needed directions to the nearest hospital.

It is believed at this point that someone has opened her car and removed her bank card from her purse.

The card has then been used to make several large purchases throughout the day before the victim realised the card had been stolen and then contacted her bank and had the card cancelled.

Officers would like to speak to the man pictured who was in the area at the time and may be able to help with enquiries.
