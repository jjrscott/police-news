A baby boy who suffered head injuries during an alleged assault has died.

The two-month-old was airlifted to hospital after paramedics were called to an address in Steward Gate, Bamford, on Thursday afternoon.

He had been in a critical condition in intensive care at Sheffield Children's Hospital since then, but sadly he passed away earlier this evening.

We have a team of specialist officers supporting the baby's mother and family.

Our investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident is continuing and we would urge anyone with information that could help to get in touch with us on the non-emergency number, 101.

Anton Shields, of Hardwick Crescent, Barnsley, was arrested on Thursday and was charged with assault occasioning grievous bodily harm with intent.

He appeared at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court this morning and was remanded into prison custody. He will reappear at court at a later date.
