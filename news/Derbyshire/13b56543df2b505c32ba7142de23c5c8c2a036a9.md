Detectives investigating the death of a man who died after an alleged assault outside a bar in Chesterfield have released images of people they want to trace.

Joseph Robotham was taken to hospital after officers were called to an incident outside Vibe bar, in Holywell Street, at about 3.50am on Saturday 8 February.

The 23-year-old was allegedly struck over the head with a bottle and sadly died in hospital the next day.

Officers continue to investigate the incident and have released images of two men and three women they want to speak to.

We would like to make it clear that the people in these images are potential witnesses and not suspects.
