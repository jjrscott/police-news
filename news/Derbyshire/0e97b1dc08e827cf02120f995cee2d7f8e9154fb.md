Officers are appealing for dash cam and CCTV footage, following a ram raid at a convenience store in Killamarsh.

We were called at around 2.50am to reports that a car had collided with a shop in Rotherham Road.

The car, a dark-coloured hatchback, left the scene. Cigarettes and bottles of spirits have been reported as stolen.

Investigations are ongoing, and officers are keen to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time who may have dash cam footage, or anyone in neighbouring properties with CCTV.
