We're appealing for witnesses after a Peregrine Falcon was found injured in Belper earlier this week.

The bird was taken to local vets on Wednesday 4 March but died following surgery. We're now appealing for information about how the Falcon became injured.

Sergeant James Shirley from Derbyshire Constabulary's rural crime team said: "The Peregrine Falcon was examined by a vet and it was found that it's injuries were consistent with a collision of some kind.

"However, X-rays did show that the bird had a lead shot embedded within its body. The shot was concealed by healed skin, suggesting that it had been there for some time.

"Raptor persecution is a crime and we would like to hear from anyone who has information about how the shot came to be there."
