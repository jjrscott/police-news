Officers were called to reports of a collision between a motorbike and a car just after 11am on Saturday, April 20.

The collision took place on the B6052 Eckington Road between New Whittington and Eckington.

Eckington Road from Handley Road to Springwell Hill was closed for several hours while investigations were carried out.

Sadly, the motorcyclist died at the scene. He has been named as Wayne Turton (33) of Foxstone Way, Eckington. Our thoughts are with his family at this time.

We are keen to speak to anyone who saw the two vehicles, a grey Yamaha YZF-R6 motorbike and a black BMW 320, prior to the collision, especially anyone with dash cam footage.

If you believe you have video that may help the investigation then it should be downloaded to an external device and secured for officers to view.

If you have any information which may assist with our enquiries, please get in touch using one of the following non-emergency contact methods.
