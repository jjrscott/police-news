A man asked an elderly woman for help before burgling her.

At around 12.15pm yesterday (Wednesday 26 February), an 89-year-old woman returned to her home in Burton Road, Overseal, after a shopping trip.

She put her handbag in the hall and walked onto the driveway, where she was approached by a man who asked for a jug of water for his van's radiator.

While she was in the kitchen getting this for him, the man sneaked into the hallway and stole her handbag.

She has described him as white, slim, in his late 20s and about 5ft 7ins tall.

We want to speak to witnesses, or anyone who was driving in the area at the time who has dashcam footage of a white van parked on Burton Road, between the junction of the Mount Pleasant Road roundabout and Green Lane.
