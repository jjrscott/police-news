A 30-year-old man has been charged after a fire at a caravan in Hadfield on Tuesday, June 25.

We were called to reports of a fire at a caravan in Station Road at 5.15am and attended alongside Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service. It is believed that a 22-year-old man had been inside the caravan when the fire started but he had managed to escape uninjured.

Liam Churchman, of Station Road, Hadfield was charged with arson reckless to whether life was endangered early this morning (Thursday, June 27).

He will appear at Chesterfield Magistrates Court this morning.
