We're appealing for information after an attempted robbery in Chaddesden yesterday afternoon.

We received a report that a 19-year-old man had been approached by another man who demanded money and threatened him in Chaddesden Lane at around 4.45pm.

The location of the incident was said to be near Wilsthorpe Road shops.

The victim managed to run away and the would-be robber is understood to have left in the direction of Nottingham Road.

He is described as a white man, aged in his late teens or early twenties, around 6ft tall and of slim build. His clothing was all dark-coloured and consisted of a hoodie, tracksuit bottoms and Nike trainers.

Officers would like to anyone who was in the area at the time and may have witnessed the incident, or any passing motorists who may have been driving in the area at the time with dash cam installed.

If you believe you have footage that may be of use to officers please ensure it is downloaded onto another device and secured for them to view.
