Temperatures are dropping throughout the county and this dip could lead to icy road surfaces for motorists across Derbyshire tonight. Gritters are out spreading salt but we would caution anybody having to travel anywhere to take extra care and drive to the conditions.

Water levels have been rising in Derby during the afternoon and evening causing a number of road closures in the city centre, particularly westbound from the Pentagon. Derby City Council's Twitter account has the latest on conditions within the city: https://twitter.com/DerbyCC

A number of road closures are also still in place further afield in the county, particularly along the A6 in Milford, Ambergate and Matlock.

Flood warnings are in place across the county and the latest information on whether these may affect you can be found on the gov.uk website: https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/warnings
