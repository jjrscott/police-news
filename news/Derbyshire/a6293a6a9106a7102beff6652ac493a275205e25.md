Officers investigating a sexual assault in Chapel-en-le-Frith are appealing for information after a woman was touched on her bottom.

The incident occurred at around 6.30am on Saturday, 29 February, in Market Street.

The man, who was wearing a waist length dark coat with a hood, dark trousers and had skinny legs, touched the woman's bottom and then walked off down Thornbrook Road.

Nearby CCTV shows a man matching the description of the person crossing the road and, while the footage is not clear, it is hoped someone recognises the build or walk of the person pictured.
