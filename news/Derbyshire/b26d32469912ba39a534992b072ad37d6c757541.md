We are investigating two robberies in Derby, which we believe to be linked.

At around 2.10pm on Thursday 19 March, three teenage boys entered the University of Derby site from Carsington Crescent.

Two youths on bicycles followed them and chased them onto Broadway and Broadway Park Close. They caught up with the boys and threatened them, taking their wallets and some clothing.

The victims have described the robbers as black and aged 15-17. One is about 5ft tall and has short afro-style hair. He wore dark clothing.

The other youth is about 5ft 8ins tall and wore a grey tracksuit.

We want to speak to witnesses or anyone who may have recorded dash cam footage of the chase. The reference number for this crime is 20000153866.

We are linking this crime to another that happened on the same day at about 6pm. A man walked from Willow Row onto Lodge Lane and noticed a youth on the pavement who called him over. Two youths on bikes then approached him and the three robbers surrounded him. They threatened him and took his mobile and Apple air pods.

The victim has described the youth on the pavement as aged 16 or 17, black and about 6ft tall. He wore a dark tracksuit.

The youths on bikes were aged 16 or 17 and black. Both wore balaclavas and one rode a BMX-style bike.

The reference number for this crime is 20000153915.
