Detectives are appealing for witnesses to come forward after a man was found with life threatening injuries in a Chesterfield street.

We were called by the ambulance service to reports that a man had been found in Highfield Lane with a serious head injury. It is believed that the man, a 47-year-old from Chesterfield, was the victim of an assault that took place outside Birchover Court at around 9.15pm last night (June 27).

Officers want to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and may have seen the incident.

They are especially keen to hear from any drivers who may have been in the area and have dashcam footage.

If you have video that may be of use to officers please download it and keep it secure for an officer to view.

Anyone with any information that can help detectives with their enquiries should get in contact immediately, either directly with the force, or anonymously via Crimestoppers.

In any correspondence please include reference 19*333851:
