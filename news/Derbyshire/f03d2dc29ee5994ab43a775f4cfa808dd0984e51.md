A woman was arrested after reports that she had been walking through Normanton with a knife.

Police were called to the Lower Dale Road area at about 2.40pm following a domestic dispute in which a woman walked off from a house while carrying a knife.

Officers attempted to stop the woman, who fled along nearby streets and eventually stopped outside the Guru Arjan Dev gurdwara in Dale Road.

A 23-year-old woman was then arrested on suspicion of possessing a bladed article in a public place and remains in police custody.

Inspector Keith Chambers, who is in charge of policing in the area, said: "Officers acted quickly to locate the woman and bring the incident to a conclusion.

"Incidents of this nature can obviously cause public alarm and it happened in the middle of the day in a very busy area.

"However I would like to reassure people that it was an isolated incident and the result of a domestic disturbance in a private property. There was no threat to the wider public or the gurdwara itself.

"I would also like to thank the public for their patience and support while we dealt with the incident."
