A man has died following an incident in Old Whittington and a main road is closed.

We were called to Station Lane, the junction of Ashcroft Drive, at 1.10pm today following reports that a large trailer had become detached from a tractor and fallen upon a Toyota Aygo.

The passenger in the car died at the scene while the driver has been taken to hospital with minor injuries.

The tractor driver has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.

Station Lane is closed from Station Lane industrial estate to Gypsy Lane.

There is no access to the industrial estate but people who are already at the site will be allowed to leave.

The road will be closed for some time as we carry out investigations and clear the scene.

We want to hear from any witnesses or anyone who has dashcam footage of either vehicle before the incident. Please quote reference 610 of July 30;
