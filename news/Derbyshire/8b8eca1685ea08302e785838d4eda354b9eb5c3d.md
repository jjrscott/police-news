A second stolen dachshund has been found safe and has been reunited with his owners.

Eight dogs were stolen from a property in Burton Road, Acresford, near Swadlincote, sometime between 11.30pm and midnight on Wednesday 10 February.

The pedigree dog was found in Northamptonshire yesterday and taken to a vet for a check-up.

We continue to investigate the theft and to search for the remaining six miniature wire-haired dachshunds.

Pictured are four of the dogs, which we have released previously as part of the investigation.
