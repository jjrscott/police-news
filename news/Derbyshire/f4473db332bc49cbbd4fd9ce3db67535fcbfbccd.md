A 37-year-old man has been charged and remanded in prison after an alleged serious assault in Derby.

Officers were called to reports that a man had been assaulted in Rimsdale Close, Sinfin, at around 5.50pm on Saturday, 18 January.

At the scene a 43-year-old man was found with serious, but at this time not believed to be life-threatening, injuries. He was taken to the Queens Medical Centre where he remains receiving treatment for his injuries.

Barrington Azille, of Rimsdale Close, Derby, was arrested on suspicion of assault and later charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

He appeared at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court where he was remanded to prison and is due to appear at Nottingham Crown Court on 17 February.
