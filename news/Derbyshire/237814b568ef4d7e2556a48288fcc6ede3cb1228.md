No one should feel scared of being in their own home. That is why we are supporting the Government's #YouAreNotAlone campaign.

If you or someone you know is suffering from Domestic Abuse, isolation rules do not apply.

Survivors and their children can leave their house and move to different accommodation to get out of a hostile situation, or to avoid or escape risk of injury or harm.

Police and support services remain available, and you are also eligible to free train tickets.

The 'Rail to refuge' scheme offers free train tickets for men, women, and their children, to travel to a recognised refuge. Survivors can access the tickets through the member services of Women's Aid Federation of England, Welsh Women's Aid, Scottish Women's Aid and Imkaan, once they have received an offer of a refuge place.

East Midlands Railway is supporting this scheme.

Members of these organisations can book the tickets via a bespoke booking system for the people they are referring to, or receiving in, their refuge accommodation.

Find more support at www.gov.uk/domestic-abuse, or call 999 if you are in immediate danger.
