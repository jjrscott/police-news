We are appealing for witnesses after a couple were woken in the early hours to discover their home had been broken into and a bicycle stolen.

Can you help us trace the bike, which looks like this?

At around 3.30am on Friday 24 July a couple were asleep at home on Beresford Road, Sawley, when they were alerted to a noise downstairs.

They went downstairs and discovered their house had been broken into, and a bike had been stolen.

While we would like to hear from anyone who may have noticed anything suspicious in the area we have also issued a picture in the hope of tracing the cycle.

It is a manufacturers image, not of the exact bike, a blue and yellow Cube Analog.
