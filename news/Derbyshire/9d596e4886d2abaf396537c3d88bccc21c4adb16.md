A Derby man has been remanded in to prison custody after we found, what we suspect to be, Class A drugs in his house.

The incident happened at around 3am yesterday morning, Monday, 4 May, when we were called to an address on Jemison Close, Derby.

Because of concerns for the safety of the people in the house, officers entered and found a quantity of what is believed to be Class A drugs, namely Heroin and Crack Cocaine. One of the occupants, 27-year-old Kane Mosley, who lives at the address, was arrested.

Today, Mr Mosley has appeared at Southern Derbyshire Magistrate's Court charged with two offences of possession with intent to supply controlled drugs of Class A, namely Heroin and Crack Cocaine.

He was remanded to prison custody to appear at Derby Crown Court on Tuesday, 2 June.
