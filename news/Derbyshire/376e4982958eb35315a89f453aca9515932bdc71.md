Two men and two women have been arrested in connection with a burglary at the home of a paramedic who was out on a 12-hour shift.

A yellow NORCO Fluid mountain bike, Playstation 4, Garmin Edge GPS device and an NHS polo shirt were stolen from a house in Little Hallam Way, Ilkeston.

The burglary happened between 5pm on Tuesday 14 April and 7am the next morning, which was when the victim - a paramedic - was out at work.

Two men aged 30 and 66, and two 30-year-old women, were arrested on suspicion of burglary yesterday.

All four have been bailed pending further enquiries.

We are still trying to trace the stolen items and are reissuing photos of the bike and a stock image of the GPS device.
