We are asking people to be mindful of their parking should they be making a journey under the guidelines this weekend.

As many car parks, amongst other facilities, in more traditionally popular areas may be closed, please make sure that you are able to park your vehicle legally and safely if you travel there and not block any carriageways.

Whilst the Government is advising that we stay home as much as possible, we ask is that if you are thinking of travelling this weekend, please also consider that you can do so whilst still abiding by the full range of the new advice from the Government.

For more information on the new guidelines, please visit the Government's COVID-19 website: https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus

See your local council's social media accounts for more current information on accessing their services.
