At the moment the world can feel like a scary place to exist in.

For many our everyday lives have come to a halt, we're unable to see our loved ones, and many people are becoming ill.

In the midst of all of this, it is perfectly normal if you are feeling anxious, worried, low or overwhelmed.

Whether you have worries about your own health, or that of those close to you, work, money, social distancing or anything else, you are not alone in these feelings.

We all have mental health, good and bad, and when things seem uncertain it can feel extremely difficult to look after our emotional wellbeing.

This is particularly the case for anyone who may already be struggling with existing mental health difficulties.

The good news is there are support services available, within Derbyshire specifically, and nationally who can provide help, advice and support.

The Derbyshire County Council website provides tips on how to look after your emotional health, signposts to services who can help if you are struggling and gives advice about how you might implement a self-care plan to ensure you remain well mentally and emotionally during this challenging time.

You will also find information about where to get help if you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health crisis and requires urgent help.

Now more than ever, it is crucial that we check up on our loved ones, the elderly and vulnerable. If you think someone you know may need support, and you feel able, give them a call or text to see how they are and share the information above - it may just help you too.
