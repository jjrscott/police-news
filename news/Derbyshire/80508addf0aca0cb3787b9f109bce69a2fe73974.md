We are appealing for information after an alleged burglary of two high-value mountain bikes in Bamford.

The incident took place sometime between 21:30 to 22:30 on Sunday 21 March, on Saltergate Lane, Bamford.

The owners of the property reported hearing a loud noise coming from their garage, when looking outside they saw a white male dressed all in black, who then ran off after being seen.
