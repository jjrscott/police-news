Detectives investigating the theft of a catalytic converter from a car in Littleover are appealing for witnesses.

We received a report at 12.05pm today that a catalytic converter had been stolen from a Toyota Prius in Chain Lane.

Three men were reportedly seen nearby and were said to have left the area in a black Mazda 6.

Officers attended and a short time later three men aged 30, 32 and 23 were arrested in connection with the incident.

Officers located a number of other catalytic converters following the incident and are keen to hear from anyone who believes they may have had one stolen recently.

If you wish to report a theft, or have any other information which may assist officers with their enquiries, please contact Detective Constable Nicola Findler quoting reference number 2*502866.
