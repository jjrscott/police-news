A 43-year-old man has been charged with assisting an offender in connection with an alleged murder in Killamarsh.

Police and ambulance crews were called to Westthorpe Road about 10pm on Monday 29 March to reports that a man had been assaulted.

Ricky Collins, 31, was found seriously injured nearby and taken to hospital, where he sadly died.

A murder investigation was subsequently launched and earlier this week, a 43-year-old man and a 16-year-old boy were arrested in connection with it.

The man, from Sheffield, has now been charged with assisting an offender and appeared at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court this morning, where he was remanded into custody.

The 16-year-old boy has been bailed pending further inquiries.
