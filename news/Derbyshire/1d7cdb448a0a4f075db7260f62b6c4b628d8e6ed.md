A scene at a block of flats in Newbold, Chesterfield remains in place whilst officers carry out searches after a device was found in an outhouse nearby in the early hours of this morning.

Emergency services and the Ministry of Defence attended the flats off Devonshire Close, after we received a call at 2am this morning about concerns of safety for a man.

A device was found in an outhouse at the rear of the flats and the area has since been made safe and the device destroyed.

A 25-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of making an explosive substance with intent to endanger life/injure property. He remains in police custody.

The block of flats was evacuated for the safety of residents and will remain so whilst enquiries continue.

Further updates will be issued when information is received.
