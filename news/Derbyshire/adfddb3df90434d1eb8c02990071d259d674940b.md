Detectives investigating an alleged robbery in Derby have released an image of a man they would like to speak to about the incident.

A 26-year-old man reported that he had been robbed near to McDonald's in Osmaston Park Road, Allenton on 21 February shortly before 9pm.

A 13-year-old boy and a 23-year-old man were subsequently arrested on suspicion of robbery, and the 23-year-old was also arrested on suspicion of assault by beating.

The pair have since been released on police bail.

Detectives are now seeking the public's help to identify a third man who they believe may be able to assist with their enquiries.
