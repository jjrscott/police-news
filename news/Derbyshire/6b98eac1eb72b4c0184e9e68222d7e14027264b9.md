A road between Renishaw and Eckington remains closed this morning following a serious collision.

We were called to Station Road (A6135) just before 5.40am today (Wednesday 7 October) following reports of a collision involving a blue Corsa and a blue BMW.

The road is closed between Hague Lane, Renishaw (B6419) and Staveley Lane, Eckington (B6053), and it will be closed for some time while we investigate the circumstances of the collision and clear the scene.

Drivers are advised to avoid the area.

Any witnesses, or anyone with information, should contact us quoting reference 101 of 7 October.
