Officers investigating the theft of £700 worth of fuel from a service station in Markham Vale are asking the public for help to trace the man pictured.

At 1.45pm on Monday 14 October a HGV pulled up at the Markham Vale service station.

The man pictured, who was the passenger in the HGV, entered the store, handed over a fuel card as security and the driver of the lorry filled up the vehicle with £700 worth of fuel.
