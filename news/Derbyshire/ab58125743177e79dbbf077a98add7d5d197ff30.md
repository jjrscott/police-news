Residents of Littleover and Normanton will see an increased police presence from tomorrow (Monday 21 September) as officers launch a new operation to tackle anti-social behaviour in the area.

Operation Barbosa will see increased police patrols across the above two areas, as well as, Abbey, Mickleover and Rose Hill, with officers focusing on issues such as street drinking, rough sleepers and begging.

The operation is due to run until 21 October and aims to tackle the ongoing problem of anti-social behaviour which has affected communities living in these areas.

Inspector Keith Chambers, who is in charge of policing across the Derby West area said:

"Operation Barbosa is not simply about penalising those who are causing issues in these areas, it is also about working closely with partner agencies to address the vulnerabilities of those who may resort to begging or rough sleeping.

"Officers will be a visible and reassuring presence in the next few weeks and they will be approaching anyone who is breaking the law and causing a nuisance to others.

"I would encourage local residents to speak with officers should there be any concerns or issues that they may be able to help with.

"We understand the detrimental effect anti-social behaviour can have on those in our communities and are dedicated to working together, to make local people feel safer, supported and more comfortable in their own neighbourhood."
