Officers investigating a theft, in which a purse was stolen from inside a car in Long Eaton, have released an image of a man they would like to talk to about the incident.

A 43-year-old woman returned to her car to find the window smashed and her purse missing in Trent Meadows, Meadow Lane, at around 6.30pm on Tuesday, 16 July.

A bank card from her purse was then used, a short time later, to make two transactions at a shop in Tamworth Road.

PC Anthony Sheck, investigating, said: "Since this incident happened we have been following a number of lines of enquiry and now have a clear CCTV image of a man we'd like to talk to in connection to the incident.

"Do you recognise the man in the image? Or were you at Trent Meadows or in Tamworth Road between 6.30pm and 7.30pm that evening, and notice anything suspicious? If so we'd like to hear from you.

"I'd also like to reiterate the importance of keeping valuables hidden when you're out and about, whether in a car or on foot.

"Anything left on display in a car may make it a target for thieves. You can read more about keeping your vehicle safe on our website at: https://www.derbyshire.police.uk/cp/crime-prevention/theft-from-a-vehicle/vehicle-safe-and-sound/."
