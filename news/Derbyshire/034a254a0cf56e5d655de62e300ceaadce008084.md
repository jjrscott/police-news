Officers investigating the burglary of a house in Ripley are asking for the public's help in identifying the man pictured.

Can you help?

The incident occurred at a house in St Pancras Way on Saturday 19 September between 3am and 5.15am.

Two men entered the property and stole a black iPhone 7 mobile phone, a set of keys for a Seat Ibiza, a pink and purple purse, an iPad 4 in a floral case and a blue HP Pavilion laptop.

They also took a set of keys for a blue Volkswagen Golf Type R (registration ending RZM) which they then drove away.

Officers are keen to speak to the man pictured who was in the area at the time of the incident and may be able to help with enquiries.
