Safer Neighbourhood

16:00 03/07/2020

Officers are urging our communities to use our parks, recreation grounds and public spaces safely and responsibly this weekend and beyond.

Patrols are being stepped up and additional powers put in place in response to concerns about anti-social behaviour as government lockdown restrictions have started to ease.

There have been reports throughout the county and city of large groups of youngsters and young adults gathering, with some individuals involved in disorder and damage.

While officers on our Safer Neighbourhood Policing Teams are out and about in the areas to engage with groups and give advice, police dispersal powers are being increased in hot spot areas to help target the issue.

This includes the use of dispersal orders, which have recently been used in parts of Allestree in Derby, and in Shirebrook in north Derbyshire, and will be used in other local areas this weekend.

A dispersal order allows police to disperse groups of people from a specified area and, in cases or anti-social behaviour, take anyone under the age of 16 back to their home.

It also enables officers and PCSOs to break up groups of two or more people who they believe could cause trouble, and direct them to leave the designated area for 24 hours. Anyone then found breaching that direction could face arrest or further action.

Government guidance on meeting other people outside of your household is also still in place to help stop the spread of Coronavirus and keep you, and your friends and family safe.

Chief Inspector Becky Webster said: "We appreciate it has been a challenging time for everyone, in different ways, over the past few months due to the Coronavirus pandemic but it is important we are responsible when using our parks and public spaces, and ensure everyone can enjoy these places safely and without intimidation.

"While the majority of young people will not be involved in anti-social behaviour, we would ask those individuals to who are to stop and be considerate to others, and for parents to make sure they know where and what their children plan to do, and how many others they will be with."

Ch. Insp. Webster added: "We would encourage local residents to continue to report incidents of anti-social behaviour and damage so that our officers can prioritise patrol areas, and work to prevent this type of activity and make sure individuals are aware and accountable for their actions."

There will be dispersal orders in place in the following areas, other areas including neighbouring towns and villages will be monitored and further orders may be brought in to other places if necessary.

 * Belper
 * Clay Cross- Sharley Park, Danesmoor
 * Duffield
 * Ilkeston Town Centre
 * Kirk Hallam skatepark
 * Shirebrook (in the district of Bolsover)- Market Place
