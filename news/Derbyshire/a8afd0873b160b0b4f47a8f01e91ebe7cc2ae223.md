Our current recruitment to the Special Constabulary closes at midnight on Sunday, 27 September.

Over the last few weeks we have been introducing you to some of our Specials who have explained what it's like to volunteer with us.

This Tuesday, 22 September at 6pm we are giving you the opportunity to meet one of those, Special Sergeant David Holmes, along with Mariah Corah, a member of our HR team, in a special Facebook Live broadcast.

They will be available to answer any of the questions you may have, such as how do I apply, what training will I get and when will it be, what will I be doing if I am successful with my application, what sort of skills do I need and will be learning?

To join in our broadcast and have any of your questions answered, please visit us here: www.facebook.com/derbyshireconstabulary on Tuesday at 6pm.
