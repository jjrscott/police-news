A man has indecently exposed himself to two women in Mickleover.

At around 10.10am on Saturday 27 February, two women were jogging along Radbourne Lane, where the public footpath meets the road near Potlocks Farm, Radbourne.

They were approached by a man who was walking down the footpath. As he reached the road, he exposed himself to the two friends.

He is described as white, in his early 20s and of medium build. He is about 5ft 9ins tall and has mousey brown hair which was short at the sides and longer on the top. He wore a black padded jacket, dark grey jogging bottoms and trainers.

We would like to speak to witnesses or anyone who was driving in the area at that time who may have captured footage of the man on their dash cam.
