We are supporting UN Anti-Racism Day. We stand together united against racism, Islamophobia, antisemitism and fascism.

If you are a victim of a hate crime, you are able to report this to us. Our officers and staff are trained to deal with hate crime sensitively and professionally. By reporting it, you may be able to prevent it from happening again to you or someone else.

A hate crime is defined as 'a criminal offence which is perceived by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by hostility or prejudice based on a person's race or perceived race; religion or perceived religion; sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation; disability or perceived disability and any crime motivated by hostility or prejudice against a person who is transgender or perceived to be transgender.'

Remember, you don't have to be the victim of hate crime to report it. You can report what you've seen happening to someone else, or report it on their behalf if they don't want to.

To report this to us, contact us by one of the following methods:

\- Facebook - send us a private message to /DerbyshireConstabulary

\- Twitter - direct message our contact centre on @DerPolContact

\- Website - complete the online contact form derbyshire.police.uk/Contact-Us.

\- Phone - call us on 101, or 999 in an emergency.

We understand that you may not be ready to talk to us about what has happened. The charities, groups and organisations below can offer support, advice and ways to report the incident without having to talk directly to the police:

 * True Vision: https://www.report-it.org.uk/ \- True Vision is a national police scheme to help victims report hate crime online.
