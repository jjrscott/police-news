Officers investigating reports that a teenager was assaulted on a canal path in Derby are asking the public for help identifying the man responsible.

The girl was walking along the canal path off Boulton Lane in Alvaston at around 4.10pm on Tuesday 23 February.

The girl told police that a man grabbed her from behind as she passed the Allen Street Recreation ground. The girl headbutted the man and managed to run off.

While a description of the man was not able to be given by the girl, she was able to provide details of a number of cuts and marks that the man had on the back of his left hand.

She told officers he had a long horizontal cut just below his little finger, another cut around the top of his index finger and that he had a mark on the back of his hand a little below his index finger.

Since the incident officers have been following a number of lines of enquiry and there have been extra patrols in the area.
