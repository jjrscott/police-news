We're hosting a live question and answer session on domestic abuse later this week.

Specialist officers from our domestic abuse unit and our partners from the Elm Foundation will be online on Thursday 28 January to talk to anyone with concerns about the issue.

You can find out what is considered to be Domestic Abuse, and what support is available or ways to report, whatever your question, our officers will do their best to answer.

Questions can be asked anonymously or privately.

The session will take place between 4pm and 6pm and to join in go to https://www.sli.do/ and enter the event code **#YouAreNotAlone**.
