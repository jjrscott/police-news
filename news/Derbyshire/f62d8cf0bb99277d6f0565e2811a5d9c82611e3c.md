A driver has died following a collision between a car and a lorry.

We were called to Hennymoor Lane, Belph, which is east of Whitwell, at around 6.20am today (Thursday 21 January).

A black Audi A3 and a white DAF lorry collided near the junction with the A60. The Audi driver, a man in his 20s and from Nottinghamshire, sadly died at the scene.

We want to speak to anyone who was driving along the A60 at Belph between 6am and 6.15am this morning, even if they do not have any dashcam footage or did not witness the collision.
