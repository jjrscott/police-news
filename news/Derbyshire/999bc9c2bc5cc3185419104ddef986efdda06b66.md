We are appealing for witnesses to an assault on a 17-year-old in Mickleover.

At around 11.20am on Tuesday 1 December, the young man was walking with a friend along the College Green Walk footpath, where it meets Bramble Brook.

The pair were approached by two men, who told them to hand over their bags. They refused and one of the men stabbed the victim to the chest.

He was taken to hospital for treatment but has since been released.

The victim and his friend have described the men who approached them as slim and of average build. One is mixed race, about 5ft 7ins tall and aged about 18. He wore a black balaclava, a black padded jacket and grey jogging bottoms.

The other man is black, about 5ft 9ins tall and also wore a black balaclava. He wore a black jacket and black Nike tracksuit bottoms.

We want to hear from witnesses, or anyone who saw anyone acting suspiciously in the area at the time. You can contact officer in the case DC Matthew Ward, quoting reference 20000635317;
