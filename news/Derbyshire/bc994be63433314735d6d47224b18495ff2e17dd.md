A man has been arrested this morning as part of an operation to tackle drugs supply in Chesterfield.

Officers executed warrants at two houses in Brimington and a business premises south of the town centre.

A 26-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possessing drugs with intent to supply after officers found what they believe to be cocaine during one warrant at a house in Hill View Road.

He remains in custody and is being questioned.

The operation is led by the North Organised Crime Unit and has seen eight men arrested since September for drugs offences including being concerned in the supply of class A drugs and possessing drugs with intent to supply.

Detective Sergeant Simon Cartwright, from the unit, said: "We are committed to tackling organised crime in the north of the county.

"Today's action is just the latest phase of this operation, which seeks to disrupt and dismantle the drugs market in Chesterfield."
