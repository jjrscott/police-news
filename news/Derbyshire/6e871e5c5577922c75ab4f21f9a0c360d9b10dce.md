Knife Angel officially unveiled in front of hundreds of spectators

Last night, more than 200 people gathered outside Derby Cathedral for the official unveiling of the 'Knife Angel' sculpture, which arrived in the city this week.

The spectacular 27ft sculpture is made up of about 100,000 bladed weapons collected during police surrender schemes over the last few years.

Its official title is the National Monument Against Violence and Aggression and its aim is to highlight the impact such crime, particularly those involving knives, has on people, families and communities.

The angel was created by artist Alfie Bradley at the British Ironwork Centre and will be on display outside the cathedral until 30 October.

It was unveiled by the Bishop of Derby the Right Reverend Libby Lane, Clive Knowles from the British Ironwork Centre, and Derbyshire Police and Crime Commissioner Hardyal Dhindsa.

Hundreds watched the angel as it was lit up in gold, blue and red, with police officers and cadets helping to hand out information leaflets about it.

Anyone who wants to see the angel can do so at the cathedral, in Iron Gate, with the best time to visit being between 10am and 8pm when volunteer marshals will be in place to explain its significance.
