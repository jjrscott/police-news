"We are keen to retrieve dash cam footage from anyone who was travelling in the areas of Mellor Street, Bingham Street, Osmaston Road and Upper Moor Road, around the time of this incident last Wednesday. We are particularly interested in any footage that has captured a white Audi in the area.

"We would also like to hear from anyone who has CCTV installed around these areas, or anyone who witnessed anything suspicious."

Any footage that may be of use to officers should be downloaded onto another device and safely kept for officers to view.
