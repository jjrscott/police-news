We are launching a fresh appeal for information about a shooting in Derby, one year after the crime took place.

A 19-year-old man suffered a shoulder injury when several shots were fired through the window of a house in Tayberry Close, Alvaston.

The incident happened at about 1.35am on Friday 30 November 2018.

Four Derby men, aged 24, 33, 36 and 39, have already been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder while a 37-year-old from the city has been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.

All five have been released under investigation while inquiries continue.

The firearm used has not been found.

We are releasing several pictures as part of our re-appeal and while we appreciate they are low-quality, they may jog someone's memory.

The first picture is of a man seen in the area at the time, who we would like to speak to. We are also issuing an image of a white Nissan Qashqai Acenta, which was in Tayberry Close at the time of the shooting.

After the crime, the car was left in Breedon Avenue, Littleover, for several days. Officers then found it in Sutton in Ashfield on 21 December 2018.

Do you recognise the man in the picture? Do you have any information about the Nissan? Do you know where the firearm is?
