Officers investigating the theft of a lorry from a compound have released an image of a man they are trying to trace.

Just after midnight on Sunday, July 9, a compound in Cat and Fiddle Lane, Dale Abbey, was broken into and a Mercedes curtain sided lorry was stolen.

We want to speak to the man pictured. We appreciate the image is of low quality but we hope it may jog someone's memory.

Please quote the reference number 19*355949 and name of the officer in the case, PC John Ross, in any correspondence.
