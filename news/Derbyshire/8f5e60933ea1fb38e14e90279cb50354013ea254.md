We are appealing for drivers with dashcam footage to get in touch after an assault inside a house in Holmewood on Friday night.

A 24-year-old man was seriously assaulted in a house on Heath Road just after 7pm.

Three males then ran off and were seen getting in a vehicle that had been parked further along Heath Road, which was then driven off at speed.

As part of our investigation, we are asking drivers who were in the Heath Road area around that time to come forward if they have dashcam devices.

It may be that they captured the car either arriving or driving off after the incident.

Anyone who can help should call Derbyshire police on 101, quoting reference 20*408996. You can also get in touch via one of the following non-emergency methods:

 * Facebook- send us a private message to /DerbyshireConstabulary
 * Twitter- direct message our contact centre on @DerPolContact
 * Website- complete the online contact form derbyshire.police.uk/Contact-Us.

You can also anonymously contact the independent charity Crimestoppers, on 0800 555 111 or by visiting www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
