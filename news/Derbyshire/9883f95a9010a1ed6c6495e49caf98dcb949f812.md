Officers investigating an armed robbery in Breaston have released further information following the incident.

At around 4.30pm on Sunday, June 9, a man entered the Co-op in Main Street, Breaston.

He threatened staff and demanded cash and cigarettes. He made off in a silver Renault Daily van, registration LV09 OVZ, which drove off down Blind Lane towards Stevens Lane.

At around 4am the following day (Monday, June 10) a van was found on fire off Longmoor Lane, Sandiacre. This is believed by officers to be the van that was used in the commission of the robbery in Breaston which had been stolen from a house in Long Eaton overnight on June 3.

Detectives are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen the van parked up between June 4 and June 9 - as well as anyone with any dashcam or CCTV from around the Breaston area.

They also want to hear from anyone who was in the area of Longmoor Lane in the early hours of Monday morning and may have dashcam or CCTV footage of the van or anyone acting suspiciously in the area.

If you have video footage that you believe may be of use please ensure that you download and keep safe the video for an officer to view.

Anyone with any information that can help detectives with their enquiries should get in contact immediately, either directly with the force, or via Crimestoppers.
