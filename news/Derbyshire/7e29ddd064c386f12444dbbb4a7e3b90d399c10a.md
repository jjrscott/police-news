A man who was wanted on suspicion of assault has been arrested, charged and remanded to prison.

An image of Jeremy Howarth was released in September asking the public for help to find him.

The 32-year-old was arrested in Chesterfield Wednesday 9 October and was charged with assault and failing to comply with the notification requirements of the Sex Offenders Register.

He appeared at North East Derbyshire Magistrates' Court on Friday October 11 and was remanded to prison.
