East Midlands Ambulance Service has come on board to support the force's motorcycle safety campaign 'UpRight'.

The emergency service will have an input into the 'Trauma' section of the popular BikerDown courses that are run by the team across the county.

Launched alongside Derbyshire Fire and Rescue's BikerDown in 2019, the UpRight campaign looks to educate bikers on safer riding and clothing, as well as hosting three-hour-long sessions where people can learn what to do if they are the first on scene of a collision.

PC Tom Rowlands, co-founder of the motorcycle safety initiative, said: "It's brilliant to have all three emergency services now working together to make bikers safer riders.

"Their knowledge and expertise will be an invaluable addition to our course and will upskill bikers with the knowledge that could one day save someone's life."

Ambulance crews will join police and fire teams at public facing shows and events throughout Derbyshire, skills days that have been organised for later this year, and will join in with any future safer riding campaigns to come in 2020.

PC Rowlands added: "We were already unique in the fact that we had a 50/50 working relationship with the fire service, something that is being done nowhere else within the UK.

"Now we have been able to go one step further and include EMAS we really are setting a precedent for other services outside of Derbyshire. I am proud that all three services see the advantages to this collaborative working and hopefully we can have a positive impact on the riding community and beyond."
