We are signposting those selling goods on-line through sites such as eBay, towards advice on how to recognise counterfeit bank notes.

The move comes as on Sunday, April 28, a woman in Swadlincote received three fake Â£20 notes when selling an item of furniture on eBay.

When she tried to use the notes in a shop she was told they were counterfeit.

Sergeant Graham Summers from Swadlincote Police Station, said: "Most businesses who handle cash regularly are au-fait with how to spot counterfeit currency, however, this is not always the case with members of the public who are selling one off items.

"The guidance issued by the Bank of England includes information on all the different types of banknote and their unique security features.

"Our advice is as the same as theirs, take a close look at banknotes as they are being passed in payment and use the security features to check that the banknotes are genuine."
