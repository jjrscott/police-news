Officers investigating reports of a woman being sexually assaulted in Buxton are requesting anyone with information to come forward.

The woman, who is in her 30s, was walking along Harpur Hill Road, Buxton, at around 2.50am on Sunday, 5 July.

The woman told officers that a man, who is described as being around 5ft 10ins tall, walked up behind her and grabbed her chest before he ran off either down Harpur Hill Road or Beech View Road.

A 35-year-old man of no fixed abode has been arrested and released under investigation.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who was in the area, drivers who may have dashcam footage that captured the area at the time and homeowners who may have CCTV that may have captured images useful to the investigation.
