We are concerned for the safety of Margaret Connors, who is also known as Katie Cash.

Margaret is around 14 years old and was last seen in St Peter's Street, Derby, on Wednesday, 14 August.

She is described as being around 5ft tall, of slim build, with long blonde hair and blue eyes. She speaks with an Irish accent and has a distinctive birth mark on the right-hand side of her face.

Margaret is believed to still be in Derby, however, she also has links to the Northampton area.

If you have seen her, or know of her whereabouts, phone Derbyshire police on 101 with reference number 929 of 2 August.
