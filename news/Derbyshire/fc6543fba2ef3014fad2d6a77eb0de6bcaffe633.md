Officers investigating an alleged incident of racist abuse at Pride Park Stadium following the FA Cup tie between Derby County FC and Manchester United FC have released images of four men they wish to speak to.

As the Manchester United players were leaving the stadium on Thursday, 5 March, a large number of fans were stood outside the team bus.

Video footage that has circulated online captures the moment that racist abuse is directed at one of the players.

Officers conducting the enquiries are keen to speak to the people pictured who were in the area at the time the abuse occurred.

We do understand that these pictures are not of the highest quality but are the best that are available to us at this time.

PC Roger Brown QPM, the dedicated officer for Derby County football policing, said: "Scenes such as this have no place in football.

"The match was fantastically supported by both home and away fans - unfortunately the actions of a mindless minority have cast a shadow over the tie.

"I, along with colleagues from both football clubs and colleagues from Greater Manchester Police, will work together to help bring those responsible to justice."
