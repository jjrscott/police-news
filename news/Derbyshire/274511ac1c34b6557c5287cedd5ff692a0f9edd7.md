A man who dismembered a pensioner in Chesterfield has been found guilty of his murder.

Graham Snell was murdered by Daniel Walsh at his home in Marsden Street, Chesterfield, on 20 June 2019.

The 30-year-old then dismembered Mr Snell and over the course of a number of days deposited the body parts across the town - including in a badger set.

Walsh claimed that he found Mr Snell dead and, in a panic, said he bought saws and rubble bags from a local hardware shop in order to dispose of the body.

Walsh, who was arrested on 30 June, spent the days after Mr Snell's death travelling to Sheffield to gamble at a casino - as well as visiting local massage parlours and buying drink and drugs - all of which was paid for out of Mr Snell's savings.

The jury did not believe Walsh's version of events and, following a three-week trial at Derby Crown court, found him guilty of all charges.

Detective Chief Inspector Sally Blaiklock, who led the investigation into the murder of Mr Snell, said: "The depraved acts that Daniel Walsh carried out on Graham Snell, a retired pensioner; a quiet man and a good neighbour, are truly shocking.

"To compound that this is that they were carried out for his own self-preservation and so he could spend Graham's small amount of savings at massage parlours, in casinos and on drink and drugs.

"After several years in policing, and seeing some of the worst crimes imaginable, I have often thought there is little that could surprise me - but then we came across Daniel Walsh.

"The evidence the team uncovered during the investigation has been extremely distressing for those working on the case and those that have had to listen to evidence in court.

"I welcome today's verdict and hope that this allow Graham's family, friends and neighbours to come to terms with what happened to a much-loved man who will never be forgotten.

"I would like to put on record my thanks to the investigation team and the search teams whose tenacity and resilience, in the most unpleasant of circumstances, have allowed Graham to be laid to rest with the dignity he deserves. I would also like to thank the prosecution team for their professional delivery of the evidence.

"Today I want to focus on remembering Graham and commend those who knew him and those that we effected by this investigation that stepped up and supported the police.

"While I remain utterly appalled by the circumstances of Graham's death I have been consoled by the power of the local community, of the friendship and love of those who knew him and the good neighbours who looked out for Graham even after his death."
