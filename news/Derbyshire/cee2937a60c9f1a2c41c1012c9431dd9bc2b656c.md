A motorist has been charged and remanded in custody after an incident on the A38 last week.

Mark Newbold, 52, of no fixed abode, was arrested on 5 February and later charged with failing to stop, driving without a licence, driving without insurance and theft.

The charges come after officers noticed a suspicious vehicle towing a caravan on the southbound Ripley stretch of the A38 at around 6.25am on 5 February.

The vehicle was followed by officers and stopped shortly before the exit for Kilburn.

Mr Newbold is next due to appear at Nottingham Crown Court on 8 March.
