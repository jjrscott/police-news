We're appealing for witnesses after a cyclist was found injured in a road in Hathersage on Saturday evening.

Shortly before 5.15pm on 27 February we were called to report that a man had been found with a head injury, after falling from his bike in The Dale.

He was treated by paramedics at the scene who described his injuries as life changing.

The man was riding a burgundy road bike, which had a badly damaged wheel and officers are investigating the possibility that he may have been involved in a collision.

Anyone who was travelling in the area around the time with information about how the man became injured, or dashcam which may have captured the incident, is asked to contact PC Joseph Pickering quoting reference number 21*115805.
