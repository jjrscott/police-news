Officers investigating a robbery in Derby have released images of a man who they would like to speak to about the incident.

It is thought he may be able to assist with their enquiries.

The robbery happened at 2pm on Friday 26 February in Overdale Road, Normanton when a 17-year-old boy was approached by a man who threatened and assaulted him, stole a quantity of cash and attempted to steal his mobile phone.

It is understood that during the incident two men intervened and tried to help the victim.

The victim required hospital treatment for a fractured nose following the robbery.
