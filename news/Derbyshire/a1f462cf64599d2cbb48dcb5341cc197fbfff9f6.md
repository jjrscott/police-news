Despite Derbyshire moving into Tier 4, and tougher restrictions, we want to make it clear that if you are suffering from domestic abuse you do not need to stay home if it is not safe.

Tier 4 advice for people suffering domestic abuse- #YouAreNotAlone

The tougher local rules are being implemented as a result of the rising infection rates and increased pressure on the NHS, and people must stay home, except for specific purposes, to reduce the spread of Coronavirus.

One of these specific exemptions include to avoid or escape a risk of injury or harm- this includes domestic abuse.

If you've been the victim of domestic abuse, or are concerned for someone who is, you can report this to us:

 * If you have any reason to think someone is in immediate danger, or your life may be at risk, call 999.
 * If you're deaf, hard of hearing or can't communicate verbally you can register with the emergencySMSservice. Text REGISTER to 999.
 * If you're experiencing domestic abuse or are concerned for someone who is, report it to us by calling 101.
