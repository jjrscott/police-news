Officers investigating a report of fraud at a shop in Sawley have released an image of three men they would like to speak to in connection with the incident.

Three men are said to have entered the store in Draycott Road, Sawley and purchased multiple packs of cigarettes and alcohol which they appeared to pay for by card.

Several months later the shop keeper received a charge back notice for these items, which suggested they had not been paid for at the time of the transaction.

Officers are now appealing for help to identify the men pictured, as it is believed they may be able to assist with our enquiries.

The initial transaction was made on 29 February.

If you recognise the men pictured or have any other information about this incident, please contact PC Emma Taylor quoting reference number 2*404842.
