Overnight resurfacing work is due to start tomorrow (Monday 10 August 2020), between the A5111 Raynesway and Junction 25 of the M1.

The work is scheduled for completion by mid-September 2020.

The work is phased as follows:

• A52 eastbound: closed 10 August 2020 to 2 September 2020

• A52 westbound: closed 2 September 2020 to 15 September 2020

• A5111 northbound: closed 16 September to 22 September 2020

The adjoining exit and entry slips will also be closed.

To minimise disruption, work will take place overnight between 8pm to 6am Monday to Friday, excluding Bank Holidays.

There may be the need for some occasional weekend closures.

During the closures, diversion routes will be in place. These have been agreed with the Local Authority.

The carriageways will remain open outside of Highways England's working hours, detailed above.
