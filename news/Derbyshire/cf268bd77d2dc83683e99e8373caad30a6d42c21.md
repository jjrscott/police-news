We have released images of rings stolen by a thief who is burgling elderly victims in south Derbyshire.

Earlier this month, we told you we were investigating a series of four burglaries and we released images of a man and a van we wanted to trace.

Now we are issuing pictures of two rings stolen from a house in Burton Road, Swadlincote, on Monday 3 February. The victim is a 91-year-old woman.
