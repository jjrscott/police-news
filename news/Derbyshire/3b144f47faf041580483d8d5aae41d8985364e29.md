We're appealing for witnesses after a man was bitten by a dog in Stenson Fields, early last Tuesday morning.

A 36-year-old man was walking his dog on the green close to Glenmore Drive and Witton Court, at around 6.20am on 9 February when he came across another man walking a larger dog.

The larger dog pulled towards the victim's dog and began fighting with it, before biting the 36-year-old on the leg. It is understood that the larger dog's owner then walked away.

The victim was taken to hospital and was treated for a wound on his leg which required stitches.

Did you witness the incident or do you have private CCTV installed nearby, which may have captured it?
