Laptops reportedly stolen from a primary school have been recovered along with a large amount of suspected drugs.

Laptops reportedly stolen from a primary school have been recovered along with a large amount of suspected drugs.

On 16 April, officers visited a house in St Davids Close in the Abbey area of Derby because they were concerned the property had been cuckooed. Cuckooing refers to a situation whereby drug dealers allegedly target vulnerable people, taking over their homes and using them as a base for dealing illegal substances.

They found suspected drugs at the house and several laptops they believed to have been stolen from Brookfield Primary School on April 11.

Ashley Colbert (38), of no fixed abode, was arrested at the house on suspicion of possessing drugs with intent to supply and burgling the school.

He was later charged with the burglary and he appeared at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court where he was remanded into prison custody.

A 27-year-old woman was also arrested at the house on suspicion of possessing drugs with intent to supply.

She was released under investigation while inquiries continue.

A vulnerable man at the property is being supported by partner agencies.
