We are investigating allegations that a number of racially abusive social media messages have been directed at a Derby County football player.

The messages were received shortly after the fixture with Nottingham Forest on Friday 26 February and inquiries are ongoing.

No one should be subject to racial abuse or hate based crimes and reports of this nature will always be taken seriously.
