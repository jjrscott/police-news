We are investigating a collision involving a van and an elderly woman outside the Royal Derby Hospital.

The incident happened at about 2.20pm yesterday (Monday 20 January) and involved a Fiat Doblo van and a woman in her 80s.

She was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham, which has a specialist unit, where she remains in a serious condition.
