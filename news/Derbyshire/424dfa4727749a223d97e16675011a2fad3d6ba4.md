A man has been robbed of his mobile phone in Derby.

At around 12.40am on Thursday 20 August, a 24-year-old man was walking along Great Northern Road from the Lara Croft Way roundabout when he was approached by three men.

They asked him what he had in his bag and when he replied that it contained work clothes, one of the men searched the victim's jacket and stole his mobile phone.

All three men ran away back along Great Northern Road. The victim has described the men as speaking with Eastern European accents. Two of them are around 5ft 9ins tall while the third man was about 5ft 7ins tall. One man wore a blue hooded padded jacket and rode a bicycle.
