Three men have been arrested and a teenaged boy safeguarded after officers raided a flat in Normanton.

We visited the flat, in Mill Hill Lane, on Monday 14 October as part of a county lines investigation.

County Lines is a term used to describe gangs and criminal networks involved in the supply of drugs in an area separate to where the ringleaders come from.

Two 19-year-old men and one 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking and being concerned in the supply of class A drugs.

They have been released under investigation while inquiries continue.

A 16-year-old boy from Essex was found in the flat and officers suspect that he had allegedly been brought to Derby to take part in the supply of drugs.

The youngster was taken back to his home address in Essex by officers.
