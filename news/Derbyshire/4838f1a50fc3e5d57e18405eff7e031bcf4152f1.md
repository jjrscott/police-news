We have released images of a man we want to speak to about a series of distraction burglaries in Swadlincote, as well as a van we want to trace.

We told you earlier this week that we were investigating three crimes in the town where a man had visited elderly people and distracted them before stealing property.

Officers are now linking these to a fourth crime, which happened sometime between 9.45am and 10.40am on Thursday 6 February.

A man visited a house in Beards Close, Newhall, claiming to be a workman doing damp checks. The 86-year-old homeowner let him in and later found that cash was missing.

A new style silver Ford Transit van was seen in the street at the time.

We want to speak to the man pictured and trace the van shown. We appreciate the pictures are small but they may jog someone's memory. Were you in the area at the time and you have dash cam footage? If so, we want to hear from you.

The previous incidents happened on Monday, 3 February at around 10.30pm in Burton Road, Swadlincote; 15 minutes later in Rest Haven in the town and at around 2.30pm on Wednesday 5 February at a house in Belvior Crescent.
