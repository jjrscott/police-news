Officers are appealing for witnesses to a daytime robbery that took place near Cow Lane, Brimington, at the weekend.

A 26-year-old man had been walking towards Cow Lane from the direction of the Chesterfield canal when he was approached by two men.

The men grabbed him and demanded cash and punched the victim to the face before leaving with a small amount of tobacco. They also took the victim's trainers off and threw them into a nearby field.

Both of the offenders had their faces covered and one was wearing gloves.

We are appealing for witnesses to the offence or anyone who was in the area at the time who might have seen two men acting suspiciously.

In particular, we would like to trace a woman who was pushing a pushchair along Cow Lane and saw the victim shortly after the incident.
