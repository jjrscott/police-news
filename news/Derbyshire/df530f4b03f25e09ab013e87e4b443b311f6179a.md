Detectives are appealing for witnesses after a group of men forced their way into a house in a city centre street in the early hours of this morning.

We were called about 2.40am to an address in Stockbrook Street and, after officers arrived, a group of men fled the address.

Some of the men fled in a Volkswagen Passat, which was driven off at speed along Woods Lane, while others fled on foot.

A suspected cannabis grow was later discovered in the Stockbrook Street address.

Our investigation into the incident are at an early stage and officers will be in the area today doing house-to-house enquiries.

We are particularly keen to hear from anyone who lives in Stockbrook Street or the immediate surrounding area, who has private CCTV that may have captured the offenders or the vehicle fleeing.

Three men - two aged 19 and one aged 20 - have been arrested in connection with the incident and remain in police custody.

The two 19-year-olds were arrested in St Albans Road and St Clare's Close and we would like to hear from anyone who has CCTV in those areas as well.
