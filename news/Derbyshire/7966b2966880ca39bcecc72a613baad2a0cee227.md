Half terms aren't always the relaxing week people think. Tensions can run high, arguments can break out, and as families spend more time together in lockdown too, they might need help or support.

Domestic abuse can happen to anyone, including within families. Behaviours can be controlling, coercive, threatening, violent or abusive. If you have a partner or family member that is showing signs of behaviour like this, we are here to help.

On Wednesday evening between 8-10pm, we are hosting another domestic abuse live chat session. Join us over on https://www.sli.do/ and use event code #YouAreNotAlone to speak to a team of detectives and support staff from The Elm Foundation.

If you would like to talk to us about any concerns in the meantime, you can contact us in the following ways:

 * Facebook - send us a private message to /DerbyshireConstabulary
 * Twitter - direct message our contact centre on @DerPolContact
 * Website - complete the online contact form www.derbyshire.police.uk/Contact-us
