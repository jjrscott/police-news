Officers are appealing for information after a serious collision between a car and a cyclist, this afternoon.

We were called shortly after 2pm today to report that there had been a collision between a Ford Focus and a cyclist at the B6178 Alfreton Road junction with New Inn Lane.

The cyclist, a 67-year-old man, was taken to Queen's Medical Centre for treatment where he remains in a critical condition.

Anyone who witnessed the incident, or who was driving nearby and has dash cam footage that may be of use to officers is asked to contact Sergeant Craig Walker, quoting reference number 508 of 15 February.
