A man has been jailed for nine years after being found with a gun in his car while parked in a layby in south Derbyshire.

Marlon Dean was arrested by officers after his black Audi A3 was spotted in a layby on the A516 Etwall Road on Monday 3 November 2020.

In the car was found a loaded black handgun and a lock knife. He was also found to be in possession of cannabis, heroin, crack cocaine and a large quantity of money.

The 29-year-old of no-fixed-abode appeared at Derby Crown Court on Friday 19 March and pleaded guilty to possession of a handgun, possession of a knife in a public place, possession of heroin with intent to supply, possession of crack cocaine with intent to supply and possession of cannabis.

He was jailed for 9 nine years.

DC Tom Barry, from the south organised crime unit, said: "While the use of a firearm in our county is very rare this case should act as a reminder to all those who may seek to obtain an illegal firearm.

"There is absolutely no place for this type of weapon in the hands of a criminal like Marlon Dean and I am thankful that the danger he posed to people in our county has now been minimised.

"Guns like that found in Dean's car have taken lives across the country and I would urge anyone who may have information about people who have access to these types of weapon to report their concerns. Your information could save a life."
