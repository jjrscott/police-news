We are appealing for witnesses after two women were assaulted in Ilkeston.

At around 12.30am on Sunday 26 July, three friends were walking along South Street following a night out.

They got into an argument with a group of people near the USA Chicken takeaway and one woman was punched in the face. The other woman was pulled to the floor by her hair and kicked.

The women, aged 19 and 20, were left with facial injuries.

CCTV shows several people were in the area at the time of the incident, who we would like to speak to.
