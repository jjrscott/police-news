People who were in Normanton at the time of an alleged assault are being asked to come forward with information.

A 23-year-old man was reportedly assaulted in Lower Dale Road at around 2.50am on Sunday 19 April.

He suffered cuts to his face and the back of his head and went to hospital for treatment.

CCTV in the area shows cars and pedestrians in and around Lower Dale Road, Dale Road and Byron Street at this time.

However, the quality of the footage is not good enough for us to identify those people. If you were in the area at the time, we would like to hear from you in case you have witnessed something which could help our inquiry, or you have dash cam footage.

Anyone with information should contact Detective Staff Investigator Adrianna Wachowska quoting reference 20*199743.
