Two men have been released on police bail in relation to an ongoing investigation into a suspicious package found at Intu Derby last month.

The men who are aged 24 and 30, and from Derby, were arrested earlier this week on suspicion of placing an article with intent to cause damage or injury. They have since been released on bail whilst enquiries continue.

The investigation was launched after a suspicious package was found in the men's toilets, near to the food court, at the centre at 7pm on 21 August.

Earlier this week, detectives released a gallery of images of people who had been in the area of the men's toilets that day between 4.20pm and 7pm. A number of people have since been identified but work is continuing to trace all of those pictured, as it is believed they may be able to assist officers with their inquiry.

If you recognise anyone pictured, please contact us quoting incident number 964 of 21 August and the reference number of the photograph you are providing an ID for.
