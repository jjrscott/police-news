A 57-year-old man who arranged to meet a 12-year-old girl in a hotel room for sex has been jailed for three years.

Kenneth McKellar-Bond travelled up from his home in Malvern, Worcestershire, to meet who he believed to be a Derbyshire father and his 12-year-old daughter.

On 23 November 2018 Bond checked into a hotel near East Midlands Airport and sent a text to the 'father' with directions to his room. When he answered - wearing nothing but a dressing gown - he was met by police officers rather than the young girl.

In the hotel room officers found wrapped gifts that the former IT project manager had been planning on giving to his victim, as well as sex toys, ropes, wine and Viagra.

Bond pleaded guilty earlier this year to intentionally arranging penetrative sexual activity and attempted sexual communication with a child. He was sentenced at Derby Crown Court on Friday 9 August 2019.

Detective Inspector Paul Carrington, from the East Midlands Special Operations Unit's Online Investigation Team, said: "The level of planning that Bond put into his trip to the East Midlands was extremely disturbing and his Internet chat was of the most graphic type imaginable.

"Within a short space of time Bond was doing everything he could - believing this was a real child - to commit horrific sexual offences.

"Bond showed no remorse during his interviews and we will continue to do all that we can to make sure that dangerous predators like him are caught at the earliest opportunity."
