Detectives investigating a collision in which a motorcyclist died are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

Officers were called to the A515 between the junction of the A5012 and the road to Alsop en le Dale at 1pm on Monday, 18 November, to reports that a red Suzuki GSX had been in collision with a Range Rover.

The motorcycle rider, a 52-year-old man from Matlock, died at the scene. His family have been made aware and our thoughts are with them at this time.

Detectives want to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time and have dashcam footage that may have captured the incident. If you have footage please download the video to a secure device for an officer to view.
