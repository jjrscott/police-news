A fraudster who stole nearly £40,000 from a Derby business has been sentenced to 15 months in jail.

Hasnija Osmanagic pleaded guilty to one count of fraud by abuse of position after stealing £39,812 from her employers over a period of 17 months.

Between June 2016 and October 2017 the 33-year-old siphoned cash out of business accounts she had access to and into personal accounts. When arrested she was found to be living an extravagant lifestyle buying items such as Louis Vuitton bags, Rolex watches and Gucci shoes.

Osmanagic was caught out when her former employers, a technology company based in Derby, realised money had been moved to accounts they did not recognise.

After being dismissed from her role at the company the matter was referred to Action Fraud and then on to the specialist fraud department at Derbyshire Constabulary.

Following her arrest Osmanagic, of Cowslip Meadow, Draycott, gave a no comment interview before pleading guilty prior to a trial. She was sentenced on April 10 at Derby Crown Court.

The officer who led the case, DC Gavin Owen, said: "I am pleased the courts have used their full powers to prosecute Hasnija Osmanagic.

"She was a person who was entrusted by her employers with information and access that was critical to the running of the business.

"On this occasion the business was able to recover from the loss it suffered - but others may not have been so lucky.

"I hope this sentence will act as a deterrent to those who think they can get away with acts similar to this and show employers why it is so important to keep a close eye on those they entrust with this type of information."
