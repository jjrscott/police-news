A Long Eaton man has been jailed for committing a catalogue of sexual offences against young girls.

Ryan Chadwick, of College Street, appeared at Nottingham Crown Court on 21 January and was handed a 16-year prison term for committing offences against three girls.

At a prior hearing the 23-year-old had pleaded guilty to several counts of assault by penetration and sexual activity with a child, two counts of inciting a child into sexual activity, two counts of attempted rape of a child, and paying for the sexual services of a child.

The court heard how Chadwick began speaking to a young teenager on Snapchat in February 2020 and offered her money for sex. He then met up with the girl and had sex with her on two occasions.

In May 2020 he sexually assaulted another girl under the age of 13, and twice attempted to rape her.

Shortly after this he had sex with a third, underage girl on two occasions.

The offences took place in Long Eaton.

As well as the jail term, of which he must serve a minimum of two thirds, Chadwick was also handed an indefinite Sexual Harm Prevention Order. This prohibits him from having any contact with any girl under the age of 16, amongst other conditions.

He was ordered to sign the sex offender register for life and has been banned from ever working with children.

Detective Constable Claire McKeown, who lead the investigation said:

"I cannot give praise enough to the three girls in this case, who came forward and bravely spoke about their individual ordeals at the hands of Chadwick.

"This sentencing reflects the seriousness of Chadwick's crimes, for which he showed no remorse, and I am hopeful that it will give some closure to each of the girls whose lives have been turned upside down as a result.

"My message to anyone reading this who may have also suffered sexual assault or abuse, whether now or in the past, is please speak to someone. There is help available, whether you wish to involve the police or not.

"If you do feel able to contact us, we will always listen, investigate and support you through the process."
