Two teenagers have been arrested in connection with three robberies in Derby.

We issued appeals about these crimes last week and several people contacted us with information.

Two teenaged boys, aged 15 and 18, have now been arrested in connection with all three crimes and released while inquiries continue.

At around 7.10pm on Sunday 29 September, a 47-year-old man was walking along Empress Road when he was approached by a group of youths.

They pushed him to the ground and stole his wallet.

A bank card from the wallet was later used at Gidda News, in Young Street, Normanton.

At about 4.20pm on Thursday 3 October, a 12-year-old boy was walking past the footpath off Maple Avenue while using his phone.

He felt someone try to pull the phone from his hand and when he resisted, the thief knocked him to the ground and took his phone.

A short time later, a 15-year-old boy was robbed on Fields Rise, close to the park entrance. Someone approached him from behind and pulled him to the floor before taking his phone from his pocket.

Thank you to everyone who contacted us with information.
