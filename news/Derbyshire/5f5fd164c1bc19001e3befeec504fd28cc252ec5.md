Two friends have been robbed of their mobile phones in Ashbourne.

At around 6pm on Saturday 31 October, a 16-year-old boy and his 18-year-old friend were sat on a bench between Station Road and the entrance to the Tissington Trail.

They were approached by four young men who threatened them and took their mobile phones and an Adidas bag before walking off toward Ashbourne Leisure Centre.

The friends have described one robber as being around 6ft tall, slim and wearing all black with a red hat and a surgical mask. He looked to be aged about 18.

Another robber has been described as slim and aged in his early teens. He wore all black, including a black face mask.

The third person wore grey trousers and a black hoodie while the fourth wore all black clothing and a surgical mask. These two are thought to be about 5ft 3ins tall.
