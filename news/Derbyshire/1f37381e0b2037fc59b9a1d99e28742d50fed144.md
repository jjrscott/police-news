Officers are appealing for information after a police chase in Chesterfield.

A white VW Golf was stopped in Sheffield Road, Stonegravels, at around 2.45pm on Wednesday 3 February, but then made off from officers.

At around 2.50pm it left Chesterfield, driving towards Arkwright along the A632 and was then seen to head off along the Chesterfield Road towards Bolsover.

The vehicle was soon found abandoned in a driveway off Castle Lane, Bolsover, just before 3pm.

Shortly after a 32-year-old man, who matched the description of the alleged driver of the Golf, was stopped in Main Street, Bolsover and was subsequently arrested.

The man was later charged with dangerous driving, driving whilst disqualified and driving without insurance.

He appeared at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court on 5 February where he was remanded in custody and will appear before Derby Crown Court on 5 March.

Officers investigating the incident are appealing for any drivers with dashcam footage which shows the driver of the Golf during the above times in order to assist with enquiries.
