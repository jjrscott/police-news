We're appealing for information after receiving a report of harassment in Matlock, where a teenage boy was approached by a man making inappropriate comments.

The boy, who is 17, was riding his bike in Sandy Lane on Wednesday 27 May at around 4.15pm when he was approached by a man who made sexually inappropriate comments towards him. The man appeared to try to follow the teenager, but the boy rode off on his bike.

The man is described as white, in his late 40s or early 50s, around 5ft 6ins tall and of large build. He was wearing a Nike baseball cap and is believed to have dark hair. He was wearing a dark coloured t-shirt, dark blue cargo shorts with pockets and a dark-coloured rucksack.

The boy also reported seeing the same man in the area when he was with friends on two previous occasions on Thursday 21 May and Tuesday 26 May.

Anyone with information, or who recognises the description of the man, is asked to contact us quoting reference number 2*269181 and the name of the officer in the case PC Georgina Wright.
