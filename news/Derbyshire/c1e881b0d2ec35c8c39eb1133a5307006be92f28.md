The body of a man, believed to be that of missing person Scott Longland, was found earlier today in woodland near to Somersall Park.

Scott, who was 27, was reported missing from Chesterfield on Thursday morning (28 May).

Formal identification has yet to take place but we believe the body to be that of Scott.

His family have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers. Our thoughts are with them at this extremely difficult time.

The death is not being treated as suspicious and a file is being prepared for the coroner.
