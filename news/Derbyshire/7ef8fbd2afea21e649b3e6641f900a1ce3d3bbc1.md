Two men have been arrested following a pursuit of a lorry on the M1.

At around 3.45am this morning (Thursday 10 September), roads policing officers were on patrol on the M1 northbound, near junction 26.

The officers saw a lorry which they believed to be suspicious and signalled to the driver to pull over. The driver allegedly failed to stop and was followed by Derbyshire officers and colleagues from South Yorkshire Police, supported by a police helicopter.

The lorry was stopped at junction 36 and two men, aged 41 and 46, were arrested.

The 41-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, failing to stop, driving without insurance and damaging a police car. Both men have been arrested on suspicion of stealing the lorry.

They remain in custody in South Yorkshire.
