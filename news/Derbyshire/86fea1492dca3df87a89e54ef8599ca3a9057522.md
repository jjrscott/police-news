We are holding a live question and answer session to answer your queries about Domestic Abuse. Whether you have been subjected to domestic abuse, are worried about a friend, family member or colleague or simply want to learn more about the subject we are here to help.

From 11am-1pm we will be joined by Chief Inspector Brian Bilby and Investigative Support Manager Andrew Stokes from our Domestic Abuse team, as well as Chelsea and Jennifer Calverley from local domestic abuse charity the Elm Foundation to help you find support.

Questions can be asked anonymously and answers can be given privately, if you would prefer.

The session is being held on Slido: https://www.sli.do/ \- the event code is #YouAreNotAlone. Join us up until 1pm - we are here to help you.
