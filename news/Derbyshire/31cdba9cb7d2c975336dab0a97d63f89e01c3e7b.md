Officers are appealing for information after an Audi car and a high value camera lens were stolen from a house in the Hope Valley.

The incident took place between 00:40am and 1.21am on Wednesday 10 June in Riverside Drive, Calver, Hope Valley.

The offenders broke into the house, took the keys and drove off in the Audi SQ2 Quattro - number plate ending UDM. Inside the car was a high value Canon 600mm F4L mk1 lens, which was in a large rucksack lens bag and a Sony 4k AX33 camcorder that was in Tog24 grey shoulder bag.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time and may have CCTV or dashcam footage of vehicle - as well as anyone who may have seen, or been offered, any of the items for sale.
