Thieves made off in a boat after stealing from a company in Belper.

We have released these images of two men we want to speak to in connection with the theft, which happened at around 2.30pm on Saturday, 24 August.

Thieves broke into the warehouse at Nelson Distribution, in Goods Road, taking alcohol and power tools, before slashing curtain-sided lorries parked on site.

They then escaped in a small boat moored on the river nearby and got into a van parked in Chevin Road.

Witnesses or anyone with information should contact PC Zack Oxley, quoting the reference number 19000454528 in any correspondence.
