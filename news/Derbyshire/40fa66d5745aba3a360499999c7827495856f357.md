One of our detectives has released CCTV footage after staff at a KFC restaurant in Derby were subject to a knife point robbery.

The crime happened at around 10.30pm on Sunday, 27 October, at the KFC, Meteor Centre, Mansfield Road, Derby.

Two people can be seen in the footage threatening staff with a knife and what appears to be a sword then money is taken from the tills.

The matter is being investigated by Detective Constable Steph Marshall who is asking for the public's help. She says: "I understand that the two suspects have their faces covered but I am asking for help from anyone that may recognise anything about the two people in the footage, perhaps clothing or the way they are walking or acting.

"Although over in minutes, the incident was very frightening for the staff and so I urge anyone with any information to make contact with me."
