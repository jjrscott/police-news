A small group of Police cadets have stepped-in to tend the gravestone of a Derby police officer murdered in the line of duty.

PC Joseph Moss died nearly 140 years ago on July 13, 1879 when he was shot and fatally wounded booking-in a prisoner at a police station that stood on a site that is now occupied by the fish market off The Cornmarket, Derby.

He was buried at Nottingham Road Cemetary, Chaddesden, where for many years his grave was marked by a simple cross.

In 2003, a group, including serving police officers, raised money for a more fitting tribute by, amongst other things, conducting a sleep-over in the Derby Gaol on Friargate.

Since then the headstone has been tended by volunteers who have continued to clean and tidy the grave.

This task has now been taken-up by a team of police cadets who have arranged for the site to be visited once a month to ensure the gravestone is kept clean.

PC Laura Robins is the co-ordinator for the Derbyshire Volunteer Police Cadets, she said: "When the cadets heard about PC Moss they wanted to do something to pay their respects.

"By taking on this role once a month they are ensuring that PC Moss's gravestone is kept clean, respecting his memory and at the same time teaching the cadets the dangers and sacrifices police officers sometimes face in their duties."

The Derbyshire Volunteer Police Cadet Scheme is aimed at 10 to 18 year-olds, to give young people an insight in to the many and varied aspects of policing, to make them aware of the role of the police in society, to develop their character and to promote good citizenship.
