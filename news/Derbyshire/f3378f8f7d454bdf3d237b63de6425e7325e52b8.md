A mountain bike, Playstation 4 and an NHS polo shirt were among items stolen during a burglary at a paramedic's house - which took place while he was on a 12-hour shift.

The break-in happened at a property in Little Hallam Lane, Ilkeston, between 5pm on Tuesday 14 April and 7am the next morning.

The offender stole a yellow NORCO Fluid mountain bike with a sticker under the seat reading 'Cycling Member'.

They also took a Garmin Edge cycling GPS device, a Lenovo laptop, a Makita drill, and a Playstation 4 - as well as an NHS paramedic polo shirt.

We're issuing photos of the bike and Garmin device and want anyone who has been offered them for sale or has seen anyone with them in the last couple of days to get in touch.

We also want to hear from anyone who saw suspicious activity in the Little Hallam Lane area between the times the burglary took place.
