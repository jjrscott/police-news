We are appealing for information after a large group of youths, reportedly carrying weapons, were seen in Langley Mill.

We were called to Queen Street at around 3.30pm on Sunday 15 March to reports of a large group of youths, some who were said to be carrying bats.

They approached two boys, aged 13 and 14, and punched them in the face.

We are investigating the incident and whether the group had come to Langley Mill from Eastwood.
