If your little ones are making a window display for VE Day, why not consider the role of the police as part of your research?

Our Youth Engagement Officer is encouraging children and young people to look into the police involvement during the war, and consider using this in window displays to commemorate VE Day on Friday.

The focus of the day is to commemorate and remember all of those who lost their lives in World War Two.

During that time, a number of our officers in a certain age group were sent off to war. Retired officers were sometimes called back into their policing role, those that were close to retirement stayed in service for longer, and women in the police force were given extra responsibilities.

The role of the officers that remained at home was to manage the new 'laws and order' - mainly enforcing the blackout regulations and similar duties.

Youth Engagement Officer Julie Berry said: "Police officers and staff played their part during World War Two. Officers from Derbyshire were sent to war, and sadly 10 of them lost their lives during their service. We would like to pay tribute to them by getting a police presence in window displays to commemorate their commitment to their country."

If you are looking for some home-schooling inspiration, consider researching how police forces changed to support the war, to consider the role women played during this time, and to find out what happened to retired officers too.

Our officers are going to be keeping an eye out for displays as they are out on patrol, and we'd also love to see your pictures. Please tag the @DerbyshireYouthFocus account in your pictures on Instagram.
