We are appealing for information after the theft of a motorbike from a house in Chesterfield.

The Yamaha DT125 (Pictured) was stolen from outside an address on High Street, Old Whittington, at around 3am on Wednesday, 24 June.

The theft is being investigated by PC Thomas Christie, who said: "The engine of the motorbike would have sounded quite loud at that time in the morning and so I would like to hear from anyone who heard or saw anything suspicious at that time.

"Sometimes these bikes can be stolen and then used off-road so I would also like to hear from anyone who has seen it being used or maybe has been offered a similar looking bike for sale."

If you have any information please make contact with Tom by using any of the following non-emergency contact methods and quoting reference number 20*320010:
