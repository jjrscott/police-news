Three men have been charged in connection with a series of alleged catalytic converter thefts.

The charges follow arrests on Thursday last week, after officers attended an incident in which a catalytic converter was reportedly stolen from a Toyota Prius in Chain Lane, Littleover.

Following this incident, a number of catalytic converters were found in a vehicle.

Thomas McDonagh, 32, of Brookside Avenue, Coventry; Anthony McDonagh, 30 of Cambridge Street, Normanton and Gerard McInerney, 23, of Webster Street, Coventry have all been charged with conspiracy to commit theft from motor vehicles.

In addition, Thomas McDonagh was charged with dangerous driving.

Anthony McDonagh was also charged with criminal damage and causing an item to be on the road, thereby causing danger to road users, after allegedly throwing a power tool from a moving vehicle.

All three were remanded into prison custody and will next appear at court on 26 October.
