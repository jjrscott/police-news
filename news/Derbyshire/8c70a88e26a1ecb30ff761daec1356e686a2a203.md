Officers have released a CCTV image of a person they would like to speak with about an assault in Mickleover.

At around 11.20am on 1 December 2020, a 17-year-old boy was walking with a friend along the College Green Walk footpath, where it meets Bramble Brook.

The pair were approached by two men, who told them to hand over their bags. They refused and one of the men stabbed the victim to the chest.

The victim required hospital treatment for his injuries and was discharged several days later.

Do you recognise the young man pictured? Officers are keen to trace him as it is believed he may be able to assist with their enquiries.

Anyone with information should contact DC Matthew Ward quoting reference number 20000635317.
