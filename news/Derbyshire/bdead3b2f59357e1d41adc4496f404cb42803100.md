A deported Lithuanian criminal has been arrested, charged and jailed after being found to be back in Derby.

Irmantas Korsakas was deported from the UK in 2016 and barred from returning after being jailed for his part in a Cannabis grow in Nottingham city centre.

The 36-year-old was issued the deportation order in August 2016 and was subsequently removed from the UK in October.

In April 2018 Korsakas attempted to re-enter the country but was caught and deported back to Lithuania once more.

Project Advenus, Derbyshire Constabulary's specialist foreign national offender team, received information that Korsakas had managed to re-enter the UK and was back in Derby.

He was arrested by officers in the city on Friday (9 August) and charged with breaching his deportation order. He appeared at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court that same afternoon and was immediately sent to prison for 18 weeks - at the end of that sentence he will be once again deported to Lithuania.

Detective Sergeant Stuart Kershaw, who leads the Project Advenus Team, said: "I hope that the jailing of Irmantas Korsakas sends a message to all those who are deported from our county.

"If it is found they have, like in this case, re-entered the country then we will find you and ensure that you are arrested and charged.

"Korsakas will be once again deported and, should he think of trying to get back into the country again, we will be ready to arrest him once more."
