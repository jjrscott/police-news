Tonight is Bonfire Night, so please be aware that rules around fireworks are slightly different.

For today only, fireworks can be set off until midnight. If you are hosting a Bonfire Night event or just staying in with your pets, we have the following advice for you:

During Bonfire Night you should:
🔥 Keep fireworks in a closed metal box and take them out one at a time
🔥 Follow the manufacturer's instructions on each firework
🔥 Read the instructions by torch light and not a naked flame and always buy fireworks from a reputable source
🔥 Light fireworks at arm's length using a safety firework lighter or fuse wick - Stand back after lighting
🔥 NEVER go back to a firework once lit, it still has the potential to go off
🔥 Collect used fireworks with care, douse with water and bury them or place in a metal container
🔥 Keep children and pets away from fireworks and bonfires
🔥 Keep pets indoors
🔥 Take care with sparklers - young children should not handle these
🔥 NEVER throw fireworks
🔥 NEVER keep fireworks in your pocket
🔥 Keep a bucket of water handy.

Alongside this, the RSPCA (England & Wales) have released some tips on how to keep your pets calm during the evening:
🐾 Walk dogs during daylight hours to avoid times when fireworks are likely to be set off
🐾 Close windows and curtains to muffle the sound of fireworks
🐾 Put on some music or tv to mask the firework sounds
🐾 Create a quiet space where your cat/dog can feel in control
🐾 Create some hiding places around your home.

For small animals in outdoor hutches:
🐰 Partly cover outside cages and pens with blankets so an area is soundproofed and hidden, but allow another area for the animals to look out
🐰 Provide bedding small animals can burrow in
🐰 Consider bringing them indoors.

Enjoy the celebrations responsibly, and if you need us please either send a message to this page, call us on 101, or 999 in an emergency.
