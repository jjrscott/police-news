A 96-year-old man has been burgled by a thief who forced his way into the house.

We were called to reports that a man had broken into a house in Brough Lane, Brough at 10.50pm on Friday 7 February.

He forced his way in through a window and assaulted the homeowner, causing minor injuries.

The thief then stole cash before leaving.

The victim, who detectives say is a World War Two veteran, went to hospital for a check-up.
