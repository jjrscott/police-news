Detectives who are investigating an aggravated burglary which happened in Buxton late yesterday evening are appealing for information.

A man went to the door of his flat in Eagle Parade, Buxton shortly before 11.50pm on Sunday (11 October) after he heard a loud bang at the door as if it was about to be forced open. Shortly after that, three men forced their way into the flat and began attacking the man.

The men then stole a black leather wallet containing a quantity of cash and a Samsung S10 mobile phone before leaving the flat.

The burglars are described as follows:

Two were white, around 6ft tall, and were wearing all black clothing.

The third was black, around 6ft tall, and was wearing black clothing and black gloves.

All had their faces covered.

The victim sustained injuries in the incident and was treated by ambulance staff. His injuries are not described as life threatening or life changing.

Anyone who was in the area at the time and noticed anything suspicious, or with dash cam or private CCTV installed nearby, is asked to contact Detective Constable Jane Cyples quoting reference number 2*536426.
