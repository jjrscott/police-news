Officers investigating a series of distraction burglaries in Ilkeston and Sandiacre want to speak to this man in relation to the incidents.

The series of crimes, which has 25 victims, is believed to have begun in September and are being linked by officers.

In each of the crimes the man, who is said to speak with a local accent, knocks on the door giving a story about needing money - he has then entered some of the homes uninvited and stolen money.

The man is targeting elderly victims, with the two oldest women in their 90s.

Officers are appealing for information about the man pictured who was seen in the area of a number of the incidents in the series.

They are also appealing on friends and family of elderly and vulnerable people to remind them of safety messaging around answering the door to strangers.
