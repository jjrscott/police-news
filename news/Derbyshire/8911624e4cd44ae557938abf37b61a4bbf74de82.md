Safer Neighbourhood

21:12 11/09/2020

If you are planning a walk or visit to our countryside this weekend please be responsible and considerate of local communities and the environment.

Close gates and be considerate when visiting the countryside

The reminder follows concerns over the past couple of weeks about livestock escaping from fields due to gates being left open, putting animals and people in danger.

Should livestock get onto the road, there is also a significant danger for animals and road users.

Always remember to leave gates and property as you find them, and help us to keep everyone safe.

We would also urge people to:

 * Park carefully, in line with any road markings or restrictions, mindful of narrow roads and access to gateways and driveways.
 * Leave no trace of your visit, take all your litter home.
 * Don't have BBQs or fires
 * Keep dogs under effective control, and make sure you bag and dispose responsibly of your dog's waste.

You can find more details on the Countryside Code on the Gov.uk website.
