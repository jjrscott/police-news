Officers are appealing for information after two teenagers were left with stab wounds during an incident in Renishaw.

The three boys, two aged 15 and another aged 14, were assaulted near the Miners' Welfare in Main Road, Renishaw at around 7pm last night (8 February).

The two 15-year-olds received stab wounds, while the 14-year-old was hit to the head. None of the injuries to the boys, who are all from the Sheffield area, are believed to be life-threatening, and were taken to Sheffield Children's Hospital where they are recovering.

Extra community reassurance patrols are taking place in Renishaw and the local community are likely to see an increased police presence in the area.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time and may be able to help detectives with their investigation.

Of particular interest are any drivers who were in the area at the time and may have dashcam footage, as well as anyone with CCTV in the area that may have captured the incident.
