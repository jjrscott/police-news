A man has been charged with drink driving and other motoring offences after a car was stopped in Derby last weekend.

The charges relate to an incident on Saturday 6 February when officers stopped a car in Upper Boundary Road at around 6pm, due to the manner of driving.

Gareth Williams, 37, of Cromwell Road, Derby was arrested and subsequently charged with driving without a licence and driving without insurance, in addition to driving under the influence of alcohol.

He is due to appear at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates Court on 12 April.
