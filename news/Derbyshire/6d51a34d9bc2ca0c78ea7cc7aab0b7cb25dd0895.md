Officers are appealing for the public's help to return priceless historical items stolen from the Derby Gaol and Police Museum.

Burglars forced their way into the building housing the collection in Friar Gate between 11pm on Saturday, 3 August, and Wednesday, 7 August, at 3pm.

Items stolen by the thieves include:

 * Swords from World War One
 * Medals belonging to Sergeant Leo Mason
 * A pair of 19th Century handcuffs
 * Seven Special Constabulary long service medals dating from the reigns of George V to Elizabeth II
 * Three Special Constable police badges
 * Two pairs of Victorian police medals for the jubilee of 1888
 * A large quantity of beer and spirits

Chief Superintendent Steve Wilson, of Derbyshire Constabulary, said: "It is with great sadness that we learnt about the recent break-in.

"The museum showcases the fantastic history of the constabulary and the loss of these items is devastating to the force and to the people of Derbyshire.

"These items are very distinctive and I would ask that anyone with any information about where they may be gets in contact with us immediately.

"I would also speak to those responsible directly - the items that you have stolen are so unique that it is unlikely that you will be able to dispose of them and I would urge you to do the right and decent thing and return them now."

Anyone with any information about the incident is asked to contact Derbyshire police using one of the following methods - including reference 19*416976 in any correspondence:
