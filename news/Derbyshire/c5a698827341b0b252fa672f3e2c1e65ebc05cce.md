Two boys have been robbed of their mobile phones in Littleover.

At about 4.20pm on Thursday, October 3, a 12-year-old boy was walking past the footpath off Maple Avenue while using his phone.

He felt someone try to pull the phone from his hand and when he resisted, the thief knocked him to the ground and took his phone.

A short time later, a 15-year-old boy was robbed on Fields Rise, close to the park entrance. Someone approached him from behind and pulled him to the floor before taking his phone from his pocket.

We believe the two crimes are linked. The victims did not get a good look at the people who robbed them but they have been described as either Asian or Eastern European, aged 15-17 and wearing dark clothing. One victim said the robber had a silver hood.

Witnesses or anyone with information should contact officer in the case, PC Ryan Wilson quoting reference 19000528715.
