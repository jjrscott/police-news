Tomorrow we are hosting another live Q&A session to give people the chance to talk and ask questions about domestic abuse.

It's as we join in with the nationwide '16 Days of Activism Against Gender Based Violence' which starts with the annual White Ribbon Day.

Many people and organisations take part in the White Ribbon movement across the globe. It aims to end male violence against women. White Ribbon, a leading charity, encourages all men to wear a white ribbon and make the promise to never commit, excuse or remain silent about male violence against women.

You can ask any questions you have around domestic abuse during our live event. They can be asked anonymously or privately, and they will be answered by specialist officers from our Domestic Abuse Unit, and our partners from the Elm Foundation.

The session will take place between 10am and 12 noon tomorrow morning (Wednesday 25 November). To join in and take part, go to https://www.sli.do/ and enter the event code **#YouAreNotAlone**.

In the meantime, if you have any concerns about Domestic Abuse, you can contact us in the following ways:
