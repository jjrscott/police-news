A fourth man has been charged with murder in connection with the death of a man from Derby.

Karl Taylor suffered serious injuries at a property in Uttoxeter New Road on Sunday, 8 December 2019.

The 43-year-old was taken to hospital but died of his injuries on Boxing Day.

Our initial investigation into the serious assault then became a murder probe and a number of people were arrested in connection with it.

Sahib Mann, 21, of Hollowood Avenue, Derby is the latest person to be charged with murder. He is due to appear at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court this afternoon.

Three other men were also charged with murder yesterday.

Mateusz Maciejewski, 19, of Shakespeare Street, Callum McConnell, 20, of Ednaston Avenue, both in Derby, and Gursimran Singh Mann, 20, of no fixed abode appeared at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court this morning.

A man and woman, both aged 38 and who were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, have been bailed pending further enquiries.
