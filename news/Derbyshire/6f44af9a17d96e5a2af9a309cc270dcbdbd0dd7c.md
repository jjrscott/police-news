We're appealing for witnesses after two dogs were reported missing following a burglary at a car breakers in Allenton earlier this week.

We're appealing for witnesses after two dogs were reported missing following a burglary at a car breakers in Allenton earlier this week.

We received a call yesterday (Wednesday 13 January) to report that the business in Gosforth Road had been burgled overnight, and a substantial quantity of goods including tools and car parts had been stolen.

Two Akita dogs, who belonged to the business owner, were also missing from the premises.

Officers have issued an image of the two dogs, in a bid to locate them and are keen to hear from anyone who has private CCTV installed nearby.

It is thought that the burglary took place shortly before 5.50am.

Were you in the area around this time on Wednesday 13 January and did you hear or see anything suspicious?

Have you seen the dogs (pictured) in the area?
