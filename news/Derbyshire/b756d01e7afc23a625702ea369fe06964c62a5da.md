We're now taking applications for call handling staff to join our Contact Management and Resolution Centre (CMaRC).

Call Handlers act as the vital first point of contact for members of the public who need to report an emergency, as well as those who need to report a crime or issue that doesn't require an immediate response.

The role is challenging, fast pace, and varied and no two days will ever be the same. The work includes recording incidents, investigating and resolving enquiries, assessing risk, and logging vital information quickly and accurately.

Our call handling staff really make a difference at times of distress or crisis, and we're looking for people who can balance empathy and professionalism in order provide the best service to the public without becoming emotionally involved.

The work is on shift pattern of four-on four-off, 12 hour shifts which include nights, weekends and some bank holidays.

If you'd like to get a better idea of what our call handling staff do, check out the Channel 5 series _Hour of Duty_ which shows the progression of incidents right from that initial call through to officers attending an incident.
