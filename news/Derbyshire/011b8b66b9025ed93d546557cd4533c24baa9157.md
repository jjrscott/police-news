Dozens of suspected stolen bikes have been recovered by officers investigating alleged bike thieves in Derby.

The bikes, as well as a number of other items, were discovered by officers following the arrests of five people in relation to thefts and robberies across the city.

Officers are now hoping to find the owners of the items which are believed to have been stolen.

PC Mike Novak, said: "Bike theft is a perennial problem across the city and one that we have been working hard to crack down on.

"Many people use bikes as their everyday means of transport and to have that stolen can have a serious impact on victims.

"We suspect that the items pictured have been stolen and I would urge anyone who recognises any of the items to get in touch with us."
