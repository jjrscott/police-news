An armed robber who chased a security guard around a car park whilst brandishing a hammer has been jailed for more than four years.

Jordan Mitchell lay in wait for the cash delivery van to arrive at the Go Outdoors store off Ascot Drive, Derby, on Monday, 9 December.

As the guard exited the store the Mercedes, which was being driven by an unknown accomplice, pulled up alongside the van and Mitchell jumped out.

Armed with a hammer he chased the security guard around the carpark demanding he drop the cash box he was carrying.

The security guard, in a move that would directly lead to the arrest of Mitchell, threw the cash box cutting the 32-year-old leaving a substantial amount of blood at the scene.

Hapless Mitchell found the cashbox empty and the pair fled the scene.

The black Mercedes GLA was found crashed in Cotton Lane where the pair had left a second getaway car - parked just yards away from the police station - and raced away from the city.

Officers secured the scene at the Go Outdoors carpark and processed the blood left at the scene.

Mitchell, who had previously been jailed for his part in a Â£200,000 raid of a jewellers in Rugby, Warwickshire, in 2013, had his DNA on the national database and was quickly identified and arrested.

He pleaded guilty to his part in the offence and was jailed on Wednesday, 22 January, to four years 8 months in prison. He refused, however, to name his accomplice and enquiries continue into their identity.

Detective Sergeant Tarj Nizzer, who led the investigation, said: "A robbery of this nature is something, thankfully, rare in our county but in many ways that makes the actions of Jordan Mitchell all the more shocking.

"In broad daylight, in the full view of members of the public, he used a hammer to cause real fear.

"The quick thinking of the guard who Mitchell threatened to throw the cash box at him meant that we were quickly able to identify him from a DNA match on the national database and he was quickly arrested.

"I would like to thank members of the public who came to the aid of the security guard at the scene, as well as those who came forward as witnesses to the incident.

"I would also like to take this opportunity to ask that anyone who has any information about the second individual involved, the driver of the vehicle, to come forward either directly to the force or anonymously via Crimestoppers."
