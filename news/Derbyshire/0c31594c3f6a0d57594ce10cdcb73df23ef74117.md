In true British fashion, the weather has taken a turn for the worst now that guidance allows us to see friends and family in our own back gardens.

Despite the rain that is forecast, we are asking that if you do have plans to see your loved ones this weekend, please don't be tempted to go into their houses to do so.

Please stay under shelter outside or consider rearranging plans if you aren't able to keep warm and dry in the space you have.

As a reminder, the current Government guidance is:

 * You can spend time outdoors, including private gardens and other outdoor spaces, in groups of up to six people from different households, following social distancing guidelines
 * Stay at home as much as possible
 * Work from home if you can
 * Limit contact with other people
 * Keep your distance if you go out (2 metres apart where possible)
 * Wash your hands regularly.

At the moment you cannot visit friends and family inside their homes, or stay overnight away from your own home, except for in a limited set of circumstances, such as for work purposes. As the guidance highlights, the more people we have interactions with, the more chance the virus has to spread. Therefore, please try to limit the number of people you see - especially over short periods of time.

If you do have plans, please be sensible, don't drink to a point that you are unable to drive yourself home, and please be courteous when parking as you arrive to meet.

Last weekend, we worked tirelessly to support our communities living near beauty spots.

The public were faced, in some locations, with cars being illegally parked in dangerous positions, causing safety for road users and pedestrians alike. Please be conscious of where you leave your vehicle to see friends or undertake your exercise, use the car parks where possible, or consider going to beauty spots at quieter times of the day.

If you are thinking of travelling to the Peak District, there is a handy service to let you know the current parking levels in each of the car parks, that you can consult before you set off: https://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/visiting/places-to-visit/car-park-status

If you are showing coronavirus symptoms, or if you or any of your household are self-isolating, Government guidance is that you should stay at home - this is critical to staying safe and saving lives.
