Since Monday, our Road's Policing Unit have recorded 228 motoring offences as part of their work on a national road safety campaign to reduce death and serious injury.

The 'One Road, One Week' campaign is an initiative from the National Police Chief's Council and will be taking place between 14-18 September.

The initiative invites police forces from across the country to focus their efforts into targeting routes with the highest harm statistics where, sadly, motorists have been either killed or seriously injured due to driving offences.

Offences recorded so far include:

 * Speeding - 27
 * Vehicles seized due to being unroadworthy - 27
 * Uninsured drivers - 21
 * Drivers not wearing a seat belt - 19
 * Drink and drug driving - 14
 * Driving without a license - 6

A full round-up of the week's statistics will be posted in due course.

Follow RPU, CREST and Upright on Twitter to find out more about the work going on in this area this week and how our teams are working together to make Derbyshire's road safer.
