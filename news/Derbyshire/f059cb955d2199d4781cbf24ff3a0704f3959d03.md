We're appealing for witnesses after a fatal collision in Dove Holes in the early hours of Sunday morning.

We were called to report a collision on the A6, Higher Hallsteads between Dove Holes and the junction of the A623, just before 12.25am yesterday morning (Sunday 28 June).

A white Vauxhall Corsa left the carriageway and came to a stop, on its roof, in a ditch nearby.

The driver of the car, a man, was taken to hospital with life threatening injuries.

He sadly died in hospital yesterday afternoon.

Three passengers also travelling in the Corsa were uninjured in the incident.

Investigating officers are keen to hear from anyone who was travelling in the area and witnessed what happened, or saw the Corsa prior to the incident.

Anyone with dashcam installed which may have captured the incident is asked to download it to a separate, secure device ready for officers to view.
