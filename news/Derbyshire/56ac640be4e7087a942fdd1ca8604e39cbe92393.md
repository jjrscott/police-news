The family of a "kind and caring" man who died in Sandiacre at the weekend have paid tribute to him.

Officers were called at 10pm on Friday, 6 March, to a house in Town Street, Sandiacre, where Matthew Holmes was found but was tragically pronounced dead at the scene.

The 32-year-old's family have paid tribute to Mr Holmes saying: "Matthew was so loved by his family. He was a kind, caring son and brother, who always made sure we knew he loved us.

"We will miss him every second, of every minute, of every day for the rest of our lives until we can be together again."

Our thoughts are with Mr Holmes' family and friends and they ask that their privacy is respected at this time.

A 42-year-old man who was arrested at the scene remains on police bail as enquiries continue.
