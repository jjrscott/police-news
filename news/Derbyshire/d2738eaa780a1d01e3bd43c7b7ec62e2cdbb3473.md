We're appealing for information following two incidents where mobile phones have been snatched out of victims' hands in Derby.

The incidents both happened between 2pm and 3pm on Saturday 21 November and involved four people riding two mopeds.

A 20-year-old woman was walking along Markeaton Street, when the mopeds are alleged to have come onto the path and grabbed her phone.

In the second incident a couple were walking alongside Bramble Brook, near to Mackworth Park and Greenwich Drive South, when two mopeds rode past them and snatched a mobile phone from the hands of a 59-year-old man.

Officers are investigating both these incidents, and considering the possibility that they may be linked.
