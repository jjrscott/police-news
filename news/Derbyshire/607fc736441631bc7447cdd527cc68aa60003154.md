We are releasing images of a pedestrian we want to speak to after an incident in Derby in which a man exposed himself to a woman.

We appreciate that the images are of poor quality but the man's trousers are quite distinctive and may be enough to jog someone's memory.

At about 5.40pm on Wednesday 14 October, a woman was walking along Derwent Street when a man approached her and exposed himself to her.

Officers have released these images of a man we would like to speak to about the incident.
