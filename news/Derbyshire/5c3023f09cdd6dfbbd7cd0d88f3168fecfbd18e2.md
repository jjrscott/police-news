A man has been sentenced to life in prison for stabbing Simon Jones to death in a Chaddesden car park last year.

John Williams, 24, of Waterford Drive, Derby was found guilty of Mr Jones's murder and conspiracy to rob, by a jury at Derby Crown Court yesterday. Williams was told he will serve a minimum of 25 years.

Mr Jones was found with stab wounds in a car park off Chaddesden Lane on the evening of April 20 2019.

The 57-year-old, of Belper, was taken to hospital, but later died of his injuries.

Two other men Kirk Guy, 34, of Haydn Road, Derby and Jacob Ali, 20, of Ashworth Avenue, Derby were also found guilty of Mr Jones's manslaughter and conspiracy to rob yesterday. The pair have been jailed for 20 years and eight years respectively.

A further two men were also found guilty of assisting an offender. Thai Johnson, 20, of Renfrew Street, Derby and Zak Stevens, 27, of Crewton Way, Alvaston have received jail terms of 30 months and 40 months respectively.

The verdicts followed a trial that lasted almost five weeks.

Detective Inspector Chris Marriott said "The investigation team is pleased with the verdicts in this case, which reflect the evidence we had against all the defendants.

"I want to thank Simon's family for the support they have given to the police and prosecutors throughout this case. They have conducted themselves with great dignity."

Simon's children had the following words to say about their dad as the case concluded:

"The sentences handed out to the defendants today are in line with what we expected.

"Nothing will bring our dad back to us, but hopefully all the families involved in the terrible ordeal can now move forward with their lives.

"As a family we would like to thank Derbyshire police, the Crown Prosecution Service and the prosecution team for the excellent and thorough work they have done for our dad.

"We have nothing but praise for the way we have been supported through this horrific period in our lives.

"We would please ask for privacy as a family as we learn to live without our beautiful dad."

Simon's partner has also issued the following statement:

"Simon was an amazing family man, he was kind and caring and would have helped anyone in need.

"I have lost the happy family that I shared with Simon. Life will never be the same without him.

"It's been a long process but I am so glad it's finally come to an end."
