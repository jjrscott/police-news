We are trying to trace these two men in connection with a collision in Derby.

We were called to Portland Street, at the junction with Pear Tree Crescent, at around 6.40pm on Saturday 23 May. We had received reports that a silver Mercedes registration ME03 ZRV and a silver Volkswagen Passat had collided and the Mercedes had ended up on its roof.

There was no one with the Mercedes when officers arrived and we are releasing these images of two men who were seen in the area at the time of the incident in a bid to trace them.
