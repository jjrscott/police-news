We have created an information sheet for retailers around the new legislation on mandatory face coverings in shops, which has been introduced today - Friday 24 July.

The information sheet has been sent to partner agencies and businesses to distribute amongst retailers within Derbyshire. The document covers the legal requirements, exemptions, how to deal with customers and, as a last resort, how police can be contacted.

Retailers and businesses can also access this document as a PDF via the following link Face Coverings Information Sheet.

Full government guidance on face coverings can be found via this link: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own
