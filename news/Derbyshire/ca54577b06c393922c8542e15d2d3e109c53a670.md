A second teenager has been charged following an assault in Middleton-by-Wirksworth.

Officers were called on Tuesday, November 13, at 9.40pm to reports that a 16-year-old boy had sustained a serious head injury after being assaulted earlier that evening. He remains seriously ill in hospital.

A 17-year-old boy from Wirksworth, who had previously been arrested and released under investigation, has now been charged with conspiracy to commit robbery.

Another 17-year-old boy from Middleton-by-Wirksworth was charged in January with causing grievous bodily harm with intent and both will appear at Chesterfield Youth Court on March 26.
