If you're planning on heading out this weekend then it's important you remember a few things.

Planning your journey to and from your destination is an absolute must. Pre-booked taxis are likely to be in high demand so make sure you get your booking in early to avoid disappointment.

If you are travelling by bus or train then remember there may be changes to services and you must wear a face covering and socially distance when you are using public transport.

When you are out you may be faced with longer queus to enter pubs and restaurants - and some may be operating a booking only policy so best to check to stop being turned away from your favourite spot.

It may be the first time you are heading out since the start of the year and it's important to remember your own limits - as well as those of your friends. If you think someone is potentially in trouble then always try and look out for your friends and make sure you all end the night safe.

It is also a timely reminder for those who may strike up conversations with potential romantic partners to remember that consent is as easy as making someone a cup of tea - and that no, I'm not sure, can we stop, I'd rather not - all mean that person does not consent.
