Officers investigating the cause of a fatal house fire in Normanton do not believe it to be suspicious.

We are still investigating the circumstances of the fire, which took place at a house in Rose Hill Street on Thursday 26 December.

Officers were called at 2.10pm and attended the property. The body of a man was found inside.

Formal identification is yet to take place.

We would like to thank the community for their patience while the road was closed.
