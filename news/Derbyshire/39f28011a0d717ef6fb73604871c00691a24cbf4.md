The family of a man whose body was found at an allotment in Shirebrook have released a photograph of him.

Andrew Jackson (55) was discovered at around 10am on Sunday 26 January at the allotment, off Prospect Drive.

He suffered injuries that would suggest he had been assaulted and we have launched a murder inquiry.

Detective Inspector Chris Marriott is the Senior Investigating Officer. He is asking anyone who heard a noise or a disturbance around the Prospect Drive area between 10.30pm on Saturday 25 January and 2am the next day to contact us.

Inquiries have identified that several people were in Prospect Drive, Central Drive and surrounding streets between those times and we are asking them to come forward so we can speak to them as part of our investigation.

DI Marriott also wants to hear from anyone who lives in the area who might have CCTV or dash cam footage.
