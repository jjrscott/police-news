We have released an image of a man we would like to speak to in connection with the firing of a gun in Littleover, Derby, earlier this year.

Police were called to Moorway Lane just before 6pm on Tuesday, 12 May, to reports that a firearm had been discharged during a dispute between two groups of men.

A total of nine people have been arrested in connection with the case, and detectives investigating would now like to speak to the man in this image about the incident.

Detective Inspector Scott McDermott who is leading the enquiry, said: "We would really like to thank the public for the help we have received from them and are now asking that if anyone recognises this man that they get in touch with us."
