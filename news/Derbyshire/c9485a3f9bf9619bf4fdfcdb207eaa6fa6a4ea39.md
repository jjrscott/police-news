A scene at a block of flats in Newbold, Chesterfield has been made safe after a device was found in an outhouse nearby in the early hours of this morning.

We were called to a block of flats at around 2am this morning off Devonshire Close to concerns for the safety of a man.

A 25-year-old man was arrested and a device was found in an outhouse at the rear of the flats.

Emergency services and the Ministry of Defence of defence attended and the device and surrounding area has now been made safe

The block of flats has been evacuated for the safety of residents and will remain so whilst enquiries continue, with officers remaining in the area.

Further updates will be issued when information is received.
