Officers investigating a collision in Newhaven, this morning, are appealing for witnesses to the incident.

We were called at 10.20am this morning to reports of a collision between a maroon Citroen C4 and white Vauxhall Astra on the northbound Newhaven stretch of the A515, towards Buxton.

The 58-year-old driver of the Astra was airlifted to Stoke hospital but on arrival his injuries were not deemed to be serious.

A 69-year-old man, a passenger in the C4, was taken to the Royal Derby Hospital where he was then assessed as having life threatening injuries. He is understood to have been transferred to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham for further treatment.

The driver of the C4, a 58-year-old woman, was also taken to hospital in Derby but her injuries are not believed to be life threatening.
