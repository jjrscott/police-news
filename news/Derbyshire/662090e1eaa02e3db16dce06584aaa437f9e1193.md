Two men have been arrested in connection with an ongoing investigation into a suspicious package found at Intu Derby last month.

The men who are aged 24 and 30, and from Derby, were arrested this morning on suspicion of placing an article with intent to cause damage or injury. They remain in police custody.

The arrests relate to report that a suspicious package had been found in the men's toilets, near to the food court, at the centre at 7pm on 21 August.

Intu remained closed overnight and was evacuated as a precaution.

Earlier this week, detectives released a gallery of images of people who had been in the area of the men's toilets on 21 August between 4.20pm and 7pm. The investigation team are still working to identify those pictured as it is believed they may be able to assist with their enquiries.

Please ensure that you quote incident number 964 of 21 August and the reference number of the photograph you are providing an ID for, when you contact us.
