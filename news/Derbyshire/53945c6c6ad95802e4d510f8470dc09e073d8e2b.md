We are releasing images of jewellery stolen from a house in south Derbyshire.

The homeowner has recently provided us with a list of stolen items and pictures of some of the pieces which were taken.

The thief took, among other things, a two carat Edwardian gold and diamond ring, a one carat Russian Alexandrite and diamond ring set in gold and a ruby and pearl brooch.

The house is in Ingleby Lane, north of Ticknall village, and the theft was discovered in August.

Witnesses or anyone with information should contact officer in the case, PC Patricia O'Reilly quoting reference 19000433025.
