We're appealing for witnesses after a man sadly died in a collision in Derby Road (B5006) at the junction with Heath Lane, Smisby early this morning (Friday, May 17).

We received a call to report that a white BMW had collided with a tree just before 6.10am. Officers attended and were assisted by Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service and East Midlands Ambulance Service.

A man, the driver of the BMW, was pronounced dead at the scene.

The man's family have been informed and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time. Formal identification has yet to take place.

Anyone who witnessed the incident, or who was driving nearby at the time and has dashcam installed, is asked to contact us quoting reference number 19*251948 and the name of the officer in the case PC Lauren Siddall.

If you believe you have video that may help the investigation then it should be downloaded to an external device and secured for officers to view.
