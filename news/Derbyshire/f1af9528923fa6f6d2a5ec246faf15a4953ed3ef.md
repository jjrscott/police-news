We’re appealing for the public’s help following a report of sexual exposure in Darley Park, on Tuesday, April 2nd.

A woman was walking her dog in the park at around 6.45am on Tuesday morning when she walked past a man who sexually exposed himself to her.

The man then ran away.

He is described as a white, aged approximately in his mid-twenties, and 5ft 8ins tall, with dark hair and blue eyes. He was wearing a black walking style jacket with the hood up, a long-line t-shirt and stonewashed baggy jeans.

Inspector Lauren Woods, who is in charge of policing in the area, said:

“We would like to hear from anyone who recognises the description of this man, or who was in the area at the time and has any information about this incident.

“I would encourage anyone walking in the park to be vigilant and to report anything that seems suspicious to police as soon as possible.

“I’d also like to reassure the public that we understand that these types of incidents can raise alarm within communities, but we are working through a number of lines enquiry to identify the person responsible.

“Anyone who is concerned should contact us and local officers will get in touch to offer tips and advice on personal safety.”

If you have any information about the incident please contact us quoting reference number 19*166174 and the officer in the case, Detective Constable Harry Bashir.
