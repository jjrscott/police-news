Officers investigating a hit and run incident in Dronfield are appealing for the public's help.

At around 6.30pm on Sunday 19 April the 47-year-old victim was crossing Chesterfield Road, Dronfield, when she was struck by a black VW car - which had a spoiler on the rear.

The driver got out of the car, picked up the victim's bag - which contained a laptop - and then left the scene in the direction of Dronfield train station.

The woman was left with cuts and bruises and was extremely shaken by the incident.

The victim described the driver of the car as being a white man in his early 20s with short black hair. He was around 5ft 10ins tall and was wearing a white t-shirt.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who may been driving in the area and has dashcam footage that may have captured a car matching the description above.
