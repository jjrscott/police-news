Crimestoppers - the independent charity that gives people the power to speak up 100% anonymously - is offering a reward for information about the murder of Andrew Jackson from Derbyshire.

Chief Superintendent Hayley Barnett appeals for information

Mr Jackson, who was 55-years-old, was discovered at around 10am on Sunday 26 January 2020 at an allotment near Prospect Drive, Shirebrook.

A post-mortem examination has shown that Mr Jackson suffered a stab wound and multiple injuries to his face, torso and limbs, which suggests he had been assaulted.

Crimestoppers is offering a reward of up to Â£10,000 for information given exclusively to the charity that leads to the conviction of the person or people responsible for Andrew Jackson's murder.

Lydia Patsalides, East Midlands Regional Manager at the charity Crimestoppers, said: "We know that somebody knows what happened to Andrew, who was known as 'Catman' to his friends. He is described by those that knew him as 'vulnerable but able to get by'.

"We would like to see justice for him. We know that some people are often too scared to speak directly to the police, which is why our charity is here to help. We have been taking information about crime anonymously for over 32 years and have always kept our promise of anonymity to the millions of people who have trusted us.

"Please do the right thing and if you know who's responsible for Andrew's murder, speak up. We take information about crime each and every day and give a voice to those who would otherwise not be heard. Everyone who contacts Crimestoppers stays 100% anonymous. Always. Even if you think your information is insignificant, it could be you that makes a difference.

"If you would like to speak to us anonymously our UK Contact Centre is open 24/7 on 0800 555 111 or you can use our anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org. Together, we can help to have those behind Andrew's death face up to their actions and keep other people from being harmed."

If you have any information on who was responsible for Andrew Jackson's murder please contact Crimestoppers charity 100% anonymously on 0800 555 111 or through the untraceable Anonymous Online Form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.

**Note:** Information passed directly to police will not qualify. The reward will only qualify if information is passed to Crimestoppers' 0800 555 111 number or via the untraceable anonymous online form at www.crimestoppers-uk.org
