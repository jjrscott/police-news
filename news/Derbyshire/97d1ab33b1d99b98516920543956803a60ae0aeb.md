Officers are warning people across Derbyshire to be on the guard for a new tactic being used by criminals.

The incidents, which have happened in other areas of the UK but are not believe to have occurred in Derbyshire at this time, sees those selling cars targeted.

The criminals visit the seller and ask to look at the engine and then take the vehicle for a test drive.

Whilst looking at the engine one of the people distracts the seller while another adds engine oil to the water reservoir. The criminals then claim the seller is attempting to dupe them with a car that is faulty - eventually convincing the seller to part with their vehicle for the scrap value of around £100.

Sellers have then found their vehicles immediately put on sale for their proper cost - in some cases in excess of £2,000.
