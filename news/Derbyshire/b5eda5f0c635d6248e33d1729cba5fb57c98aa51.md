Two men have been charged with attempted murder after the firing of a gun in Littleover earlier this year.

We were called to Moorway Lane on the evening of 12 May to reports that a firearm had been discharged during a dispute between two groups of men.

Since then, a total of nine people have been arrested.

Two men have now been charged.

They are Ismail Hussain, 22, of Sale Street, Derby, and Andre Bushay, 34, of Suffield Road, High Wycombe.

Both will appear at court at a later date.

Our investigation into the incident is ongoing and we would urge anyone with information that may help to get in touch now.

Earlier this week, we released an image of a man we want to speak to and that appeal for information still stands.

Detective Inspector Scott McDermott, who is in charge of the enquiry, said: "I would like to express my thanks to members of the public who have contacted us about this incident.

"A team of detectives is still working on the investigation and my plea to the public still remains - if you have information that could help us, please call us or give information anonymously to Crimestoppers."
