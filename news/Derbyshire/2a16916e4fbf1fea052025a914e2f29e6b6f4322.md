Officers investigating an assault, in which a man had a substance thrown in his face in an Ilkeston Street, have released a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to about the incident.

We were called to reports of an incident in Bath Street at 10.25am on Sunday 20 October in which a 27-year-old man sustained facial injuries. He was taken to hospital for further treatment.

Detective Constable Nicola Findler, officer in the case said:

"We're very keen to hear from anyone who recognises the man pictured as we believe he may be able to help with our ongoing enquiries into this incident.

"The substance in question has been sent off for analysis, a process which can take several weeks, but at this time has not been identified.

"It was initially thought that the victim and attacker were known to each other, but following further enquiries we understand this may not be the case.

"If you have any information that may assist with our investigation into this incident, please contact us quoting reference number 19000561397."
