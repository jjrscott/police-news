Officers investigating an assault at a bus stop in Nottingham Road, Alfreton, are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

The incident happened at around 7pm on Wednesday, May 8, opposite the junction with Prospect Street.

A 19-year-old man, who had been waiting at the bus stop, reported that a man got out of the passenger side of a white van and punched him until he fell to the ground.

When the victim was on the ground, the attacker continued to assault him, and also smashed his phone.
