Does your property have CCTV cameras? We'd like your help.

You could help us gather evidence that would help in investigations.

We are getting a mailing list together to create a list of people that have CCTV outside of their homes, workplaces or businesses, which will allow officers to come directly to you for help with their investigations should something happen in your area.

If you can help us, please visit www.derbyshirealert.co.uk and sign up. Once your account is created, please add yourself to the 'CCTV and security camera owner' group.

If an officer emails you, you will be able to reply directly to that email and offer your assistance.

It will be much appreciated, and we look forward to hearing from you soon.
