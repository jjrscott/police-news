We are trying to trace these men after a burglary at Boots in Buxton.

At around 2.30am on Tuesday, 24 September, two men broke into Boots in the Spring Gardens shopping centre.

They used two duvet covers to carry away a large amount of perfumes and aftershaves, dragging the covers out of the shop toward Iceland supermarket.

Witnesses or anyone with information should contact officer in the case PC Gareth Podmore, quoting reference 19000509533.
