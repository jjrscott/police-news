Residents living in Buxton may have seen police officers in one part of the town yesterday as we carried out a search at a flat.

Officers visited a flat in Thornwood Court in the afternoon to carry out the search and a man and a woman were arrested.

We are aware of comments on social media that residents saw officers in balaclavas at the address and are concerned that this is due to Coronavirus.

We want to reassure residents that this is not the case, this is simply the standard uniform issued to all firearms officers.
