Detectives investigating a stabbing in Breadsall Hilltop are trying to trace two men who came to the victim's aid.

We were called to a disturbance at Cambourne Close at 11.20pm on Friday 13 March.

Officers attended and found a 29-year-old man in nearby Roe Farm recreation ground with a stab wound to his abdomen.

The man remains in hospital in a stable condition.

We are trying to trace two men who are said to have helped the victim before officers arrived. They could have witnessed something, or have information which could help our inquiry.

Two women aged 22 and 27 were arrested at the time along with a 14-year-old boy and a 26-year-old man.

The boy and the 22-year-old woman have been released on bail while the man and the other woman have been released with no further action to be taken against them.

We later arrested a 21-year-old woman, questioned her and released her under investigation while inquiries continue.
