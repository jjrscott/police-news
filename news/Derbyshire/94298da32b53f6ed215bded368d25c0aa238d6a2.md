We are concerned for the safety of a 57-year-old man who has not been since Christmas Eve.

Joseph Akoev was last seen at his home in Alwards Close, Alvaston, Derby, on 24 December, but has not been seen since.

Joseph, 57, who is originally from Georgia was reported missing to us on 24 February. However, despite a number of enquiries, officers have been unable to trace him or make contact with any of his family members.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who has any information about Joseph's whereabouts or any family members who may be able to help locate him.

We are that the two pictures of Joseph are not of the highest quality but they are the only ones available.
