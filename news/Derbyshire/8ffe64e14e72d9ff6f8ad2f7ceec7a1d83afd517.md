A taxi driver has been robbed in Tintwistle.

The driver picked up three men at Stockport train station and they asked to be driven to Tintwistle.

They directed the taxi driver down the track towards Bottoms Reservoir.

The men discussed payment with the taxi driver, who went to get some change out. But one of the men opened the driver's door and assaulted him.

The pair struggled and the driver suffered a cut to his head. He managed to run away and knocked at the door of a house in nearby Church Street to ask for help.

He later discovered that the men had taken cash from the taxi.

The incident happened at about 7.30pm on Thursday 30 February.

We would like to hear from witnesses or anyone who was in the area at the time who has dash cam footage that may feature a silver and orange London cab driving along the entrance to Bottoms Reservoir or three men running away from that area.
