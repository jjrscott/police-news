Reports of nuisance motorbike usage in two areas of Derbyshire have seen officers take to both the trails and the air.

Two officers on off-road motorbikes were supported by a drone during the day-long operation.

PC Alex Boniface, one of the officers taking part in the operation, said: "We were made aware of a number of incidents over the past week involving motorbikes.

"These bikes, while small, are very quick and members of the public were concerned about the manner in which they were riding as well as the fact that those riding them were not wearing helmets.

"This type of behaviour is not just anti-social but potentially fatal - we have all seen a lot more families out and about at the moment and it is terrifying to think of a small child being hit by one of these bikes."

Officers began the operation in Langley Mill before heading south to Ilkeston.

PC Boniface said: "Two of the officers were riding bikes and I supported them in the air with the drone.

"While we didn't see any bikes we did spot a group of teenagers who dispersed at the sight of one of the police motorcycles.

"We then headed down to Ilkeston, around the Shipley Park area, and happily no bikes were spotted during the hour and a half we were in the area."

With the increase in the number of people out and about the team did have chance to speak to a large number of walkers.

PC Boniface said: "We spoke to around 30 people who all said how pleased they were to see both the bikes and the drone out.

"This isn't the end of the operation and we will continue to visit these areas and ensure they are safe places to visit for all."
