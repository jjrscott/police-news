Detectives investigating a robbery in Glossop on Friday afternoon, have released CCTV images of three youths who they would like to speak to in connection with the incident.

At around 4.40pm (on 14 August) two 17-year-old boys were walking along King Edward Avenue when they were approached by three youths who initially asked if they could borrow a mobile phone to send a text message.

The youths, who were all wearing masks at the time, then threatened and assaulted the boys and stole an iphone 7 mobile phone.

The assault was disturbed by a member of the public and the youths ran off in the direction of the railway station.

We are now seeking the public's helped to identify those pictured, do you recognise them? Or do you have any other information about this incident?

Detectives are also investigating a further robbery, which happened in a park close to Philip Howard Road and St Mary's Road on Saturday afternoon (15 August) at around 4.15pm.

At this stage investigations are underway to confirm if this robbery is linked to the one on Friday afternoon.

In this incident, five 16-year-old boys were sitting on a bench in the park when they were approached by a group of around eight youths wearing masks. The youths threatened the boys and demanded they hand over their belongings.

An iphone 11 Max Pro mobile phone, a DSquared baseball cap, Berghaus coat and Hugo Boss bag were then stolen.
