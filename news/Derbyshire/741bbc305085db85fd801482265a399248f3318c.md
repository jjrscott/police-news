A man has been arrested after a cannabis grow was found at a house in Oakwood.

Following information received about potential cannabis grow at a house in Lime Lane, Oakwood, officers executed the warrant at 9.30am on Thursday, 23 January, and found a sophisticated growing setup which housed 200 plants.

A 44-year-old man from Nottingham was arrested at the scene on suspicion of production of cannabis and abstracting electricity without authority - he has since been released under investigation.

SNT Sergeant Rachel Fowkes, said: "This grow would have been worth many thousands of pounds on the street - likely funding other forms of criminality in our area once sold.

"When we are passed information about suspected grows we will work with colleagues across the force to develop the intelligence and then act on it.

"In this case we have seized and destroyed a large amount of cannabis and our enquiries into those responsible continue.

""Anyone who suspects that a grow of this nature is taking place in their local community, or drug dealing of any kind, should pass on their concerns to the force or anonymously via Crimestoppers."
