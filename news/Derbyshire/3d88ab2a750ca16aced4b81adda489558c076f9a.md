Officers investigating an assault in Mickleover are appealing for witnesses to the incident to come forward.

The victim, a 60-year-old man from Derby, was walking along Etwall Road at around midnight on June 6.

Close to the Masons Arms pub he was punched to the head by a man described as being white, in his late 40s and around 6ft tall. He was wearing black jeans, a black t-shirt, black leather jacket and had short dark hair and spoke with a Derby accent.

The two men began to scuffle with one another and at that point a dark blue or green Citroen Saxo pulled up and two other men got out, approached the victim and punched him several times.

These men are described as:

 * Early to mid 50s with shaven grey hair, wearing jeans and a shirt and with a Derby accent.
 * Early to mid 50s with a bald head, wearing jeans and a bomber jacket and with a Derby accent.

A passing BMW driver stopped and the assault ended and all three men got into the Citroen Saxo and drove away.

The victim suffered cuts and bruising as a result of the incident.

Officers would like to speak to the BMW driver as a matter of urgency - as well as anyone who may have been in the area at the time and witnessed the incident.

Anyone with any information that can help detectives with their enquiries should get in contact immediately, either directly with the force, or via Crimestoppers.
