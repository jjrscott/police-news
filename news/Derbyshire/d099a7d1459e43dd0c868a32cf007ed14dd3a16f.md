Officers are appealing for information following a serious collision in Castle Gresley in the early hours of this morning (Thursday 26 November).

We received a call just after 2.30am about a black Volkswagen Golf which had collided into a garden on the A444 Cadley Hill Road.

Police, fire and ambulance crews all attended the scene and the road was closed while emergency services attended the scene and inquiries were carried out.

Three people were taken to hospital, and a man and a woman suffered serious injuries.

We would like to hear from anyone who may have seen the incident, or with dashcam or CCTV footage from the area shortly before or after the incident.
