Residents in the 55 homes in the Horwich End area of Whaley Bridge that were evacuated on Saturday, 3 August, are now able to return to their properties.

Following the lowering of the water level in the dam to below nine metres those properties are not now in danger.

Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Swann, said: "Since Friday the Toddbrook reservoir water level has been lowered well below that required for engineers to be able to access, and survey, the damage to the interior dam wall.

 "As I have repeatedly stated over the past days, as soon as it safe for residents to return then we will make this happen.

"It is my very happy duty to announce that the residents of the 55 homes in the Horwich End area of Whaley Bridge will be able to return to their properties tonight.

"While this is obviously good news for those residents there are many hundreds that are unable to return to the area.

"The dam wall still poses a significant risk to the properties that were evacuated on Thursday. Without a full assessment of the structure I am not able to be given the assurances I need to be able to say the threat to life has been eliminated.

"I am fully aware of the concerns that residents have and their wishes to get back to normality.

"You have my promise that as soon as it is safe - as we have shown today - we will get you home as quickly as possible."

Residents returning to their homes will be able to do so by accessing via the B5470 Chapel Road and the B5470 Macclesfield Road. As shown below, the A5004 - Buxton Road and Long Hill - remains closed.

Should residents have any issues with their water, gas or electricity upon their return they can contact the main providers on the below numbers:

Residents that have returned to their homes should remain aware of the danger posed by the dam and, should there be a failure, emergency service vehicles will sound their horns three times and a loud hailer will also sound.
