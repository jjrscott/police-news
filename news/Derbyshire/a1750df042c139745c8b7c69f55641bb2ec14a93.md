Derbyshire police are pleased to be supporting the national policing initiative, Operation Sceptre, as part of our continued fight against knife crime.

A range of activities will be taking place across the county this week and we are looking forward to telling you more about them as the week progresses.

Of course, our hard work to play our part in reducing knife crime in Derbyshire is not restricted to one-week of the year and the actions we are taking this week form part of our year-round response: Project Zao.

If you have any concerns about knife crime in your area or have any information about anyone you think is carrying a knife contact us using any of the following methods:

 * Facebook - send us a private message to /DerbyshireConstabulary
 * Twitter - direct message our contact centre on @DerPolContact
 * Website - complete the online contact form www.derbyshire.police.uk/Contact-Us.
 * Phone - call us on 101.

You can also anonymously contact the independent charity Crimestoppers, on 0800 555 111 or by visiting www.crimestoppers-uk.org

Always use 999 in an emergency
