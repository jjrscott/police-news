Two men have been charged with multiple alleged drug offences after being stopped in a Derby street.

Modou Sarge and Lonsdale Samuels were both stopped driving separate cars in Normanton, Derby, on 12 January.

Following a search by officers from the South Division Pro-active Team and the Derbyshire Road Crime Unit quantities of what was believed to be heroin, crack cocaine and cannabis were found in Lonsdale Samuels car and home. A quantity of cannabis was found in Modou Sarge's vehicle.

Modou Sarge, who was stopped in Lowerdale Road, was charged with two counts of being concerned in the supply of crack cocaine and heroin and possession of cannabis.

Lonsdale Samuels, who was stopped in Normanton Road, was charged with two counts of possession with intent to supply crack cocaine and heroin, as well as possession of cannabis.

Modou Sarge, 41, of Turner Avenue, Heanor, and Lonsdale Samuels, 58, of Portland Street, Derby, were both remanded into police custody after being charged. They appeared at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court on 14 January where they were both remanded to prison.
