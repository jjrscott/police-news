Officers are currently in attendance at an incident at the Toddbrook Reservoir following reports of damage to a wall of the reservoir.

There are currently a number of road closures with local diversions in place.

At this stage we are not evacuating the area and we are working with partners to assess the stability of the structure.

People are asked to avoid the area at this time and further information will made available as we have it.
