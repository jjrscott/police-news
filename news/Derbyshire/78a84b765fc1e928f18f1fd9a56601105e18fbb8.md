Officers are warning Ford owners in the north of the county after a number of vehicles were targeted in Whaley Bridge, New Mills and Chapel en le Frith.

The incidents, which took place on the 21 and 22 of January, saw a car stolen from addresses in Chapel and New Mills and alloy wheels stolen in the Whaley Bridge incident.

Officers are warning owners of such vehicles to take extra precautions - such as using steering locks - to make their vehicles less easily stolen.
