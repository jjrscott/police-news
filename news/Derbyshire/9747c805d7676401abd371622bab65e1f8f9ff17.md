A man has been robbed of his camera equipment in Cotmanhay.

The 39-year-old was taking wildlife pictures on the afternoon of Thursday 6 February at Bennerley Fields, Bridge Street.

Two men approached him, threatened him and demanded his camera and equipment before running off, possibly in the direction of Eastwood. We are releasing images of what was stolen in a bid to trace the items.

The robbery happened sometime between 2.15pm and 3.15pm.

The other is white, about 5ft 8ins tall, aged in his late 30s and of medium build. He wore a pale red hooded top with the hood up and dark blue jeans.
