Officers are appealing for the public's help following a robbery in Chesterfield yesterday (13 May) evening.

The force was called at 6.20pm to reports that a 34-year-old man driving a black VW Golf had been robbed by three men in Park Road, Holmewood, Chesterfield.

The three men forced the man from the vehicle and drove off from the scene along Heath Road, in the direction of junction 29 of the M1. The car crashed 100m after the petrol station in Heath Road and the men, who were all wearing high-vis tops, ran off on foot taking with them a large quantity of money.

Officers want to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time - in particular those drivers who were in the area and may have dashcam footage that captured the incident, the car leaving the scene or the car crashing and the men leaving the scene.
