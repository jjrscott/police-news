Five people have been arrested on suspicion of conspiring to burgle homes in the High Peak.

At around 3.20am today (Monday 11 January), a police constable was driving in a marked vehicle with his police dogs when saw a Land Rover in Rowarth.

He believed the driver was acting suspiciously and followed it to a farm. The Land Rover allegedly drove at the police car, injuring the officer and causing significant damage to the car. The police dogs were not hurt.

Five people were arrested from inside the Land Rover. They are men aged 29, 30 and 39 and two 16-year-old boys, all from Stockport.

They remain in custody and are being questioned.

We believe the Land Rover is from Liverpool are we are making inquiries into who is the rightful owner.
