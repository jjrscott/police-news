A man has been jailed after seriously injuring a couple in a collision on the A6.

Drink-driver jailed for injuring a couple in a crash near Bakewell

Gary Franklyn was travelling in his black Audi around 4.30pm on Wednesday 20 May, 2020, when he collided head-on into a red Mercedes at Rowsley.

A couple, both aged in their 70s, who were travelling in the Mercedes suffered life-changing injuries as a result of the crash.

Franklyn, of Highfield Road, Bakewell, was breathalysed at the roadside, which he failed, giving a reading of 50ug.

It was later discovered that 10 minutes prior to the devastating collision, Franklyn had crashed into a Ford KA, as it had been slowing down to turn, but continued driving.

The 35-year-old pleaded guilty to two counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, drink driving and failing to stop at a collision.

He was sentenced to two years in prison and disqualified from driving for five years at a hearing at Derby Crown Court on Wednesday 3 February.

PC Nick Rice of the Derbyshire Roads Policing Unit, said: "Gary Franklyn's reckless and irresponsible decision to get behind the wheel while under the influence of alcohol resulted in a serious collision, which left both a man and a woman needing extensive hospital treatment, and with injuries so severe that their lives will be changed forever.

"Driving while drunk or having taken drugs is extremely incredibly dangerous and can have devastating consequences. We are committed to doing all we can to identifying those who commit such offences and taking action against them."
