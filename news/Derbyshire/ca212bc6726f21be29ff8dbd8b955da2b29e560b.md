We're appealing for information after a burglary at a house in Mickleover earlier this week.

The burglary happened at a house in Freesia Close on Tuesday 2 March sometime between 8.20am and 1.20pm.

The burglar/s had forced open a rear door to the property and stole cash, a quantity of jewellery and a collection of rare coins which are dated from the Roman to the Victorian era.

Officers investigating the burglary have released images of some of these coins, in the hope that someone may have seen or been offered these coins for sale.

If you have any information about this incident, or have been offered similar coins, please contact DS Mark Ryan quoting reference number 21*120766.
