A man who struck Joseph Robotham in the face with a glass bottle has been found guilty of his murder.

Connor Rose was accused of hitting Mr Robotham outside Vibe, in Holywell Street, Chesterfield, at about 3.50am on Saturday 8 February 2020.

Mr Robotham, who was 23, was rushed to hospital but died the following day after suffering a fractured skull and severe brain damage.

He had been on a night out with friends and met up with his girlfriend in Vibe when an argument broke out with a man - a friend of Rose's.

Mr Robotham (pictured here) and the man threw blows but made no contact and security staff ejected them.

It was then that Rose struck Mr Robotham in the face. He fell to the floor and his head struck the pavement.

Rose (25), formerly of Baden Powell Road, Chesterfield, was later charged with murder and possession of an offensive weapon.

A jury at Derby Crown Court found him guilty following a two-week trial. He will be sentenced on Friday, February 5.
