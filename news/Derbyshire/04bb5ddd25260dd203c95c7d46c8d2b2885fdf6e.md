A teenager has been assaulted at Elvaston Castle Country Park.

Sometime between 5pm and 6pm on Tuesday 9 March, a 14-year-old boy was on his bike in the park, with a friend.

They were approached by a youth, who got into an argument with the two friends and produced a knife.

The boy tried to take the knife from the youth and suffered a small cut to this thumb. The youth then ran off toward Elvaston.

He is described as white, aged about 16, slim and 5ft 6ins tall. He wore a back face covering over his mouth and nose and a black Nike puffer coat with the hood up.
