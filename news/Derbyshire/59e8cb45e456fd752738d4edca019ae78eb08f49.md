The multi-agency response to the damaged dam wall at Toddbrook Reservoir has continued throughout the day.

We understand that people have had to leave in a very short period of time and that in doing so they may have left vital items, and family pets, in their properties.

Residents are now able to return home for a brief period of time.

One person from each property will be able to attend any of the road blocks into Whaley Bridge and speak to officers where they will be signed in and out.

Emergency contact details will be taken, along with the address that they will be attending.

That person will be able to access the property and will be given 15 minutes to do so.

That person should then exit via the same route they entered.

Any residents that re-enter Whaley Bridge are advised that they will do so at their own risk and the risk to life remains high in the area.

Should the dam fail, or there be a fear that a collapse is imminent, the emergency service vehicles will sound their horns three times and a loud hailer will also sound.

Residents should leave the area immediately away from the dam wall and to higher ground.

Residents are warned that the current situation regarding the period of time in which they will be away from their homes could be several days and that they should consider this when they are returning to their properties for essential items.

Further information about the situation will be given as soon as it is available - and we ask local residents to follow the Derbyshire Constabulary Facebook (@derbyshireconstabulary) and Twitter (@DerbysPolice) pages and website: https://www.derbyshire.police.uk/
