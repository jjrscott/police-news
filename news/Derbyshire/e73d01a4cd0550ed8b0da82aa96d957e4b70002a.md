Officers are asking for the public's help after a distinctive ring was stolen from a house in the High Peak.

The victim, a woman in her 60s, noticed the ring was missing on Saturday, 28 March, and believes it may have been stolen between that date and early November 2019.

The gold ring has a distinctive seven diamond flower design with six smaller stones set around a single larger diamond in the centre.
