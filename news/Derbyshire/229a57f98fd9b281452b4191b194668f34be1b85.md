Officers were called to Moorway Lane on the evening of 12 May to reports that a firearm had been discharged during a dispute between two groups of men.

Since that date a team of detectives have been following a number of lines of enquiry and have this week charged more than half-a-dozen men.

The seven men have been all been charged with conspiring to possess a firearm with intent to endanger life/enable another to do so and possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence:

Danial Riasat, 23, of Outram Road, Oxford

Abdullah Mohammed, 24, of no fixed abode

Omar Ali, 22, Saunders Road, Oxford

Zain Riasat, 24, of Outram Road, Oxford

Numaan Hussain, 26, of Stone Hill Road, Derby

Hamza Shahzad, 23, of Chestnut Avenue, Derby

Mohammed Zen, 25, of Stone Hill Road, Derby

The men, who have all been released on police bail, are due to appear at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court on October 15.

In July of this year two other men were charged with offences related to the incident and they both remain on remand:

Andre Bushay, 34, of Suffield Road, High Wycombe - charged with attempted murder.

Ismail Hussain, 22, of Sale Street, Derby - charged with conspiring to possess a firearm with intent to endanger life/enable another to do so and possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.

Detective Inspector Scott McDermott, the officer leading the team of detectives investigating the incident, said: "I would like to take this opportunity to thank the community for their assistance bringing these charges.

"Information from the public has been vital in securing the arrest and charge of these nine men in relation to this incident and I hope the latest developments provide a degree of reassurance, show that the force listens and acts upon information given and takes these types of alleged incident extremely seriously."
