Officers are appealing for help to trace the driver of a car that rammed a police vehicle in Derby.

The collision took place in Five Lamps, Derby, at 2.30am on 3 December. The Renault Clio was linked to an incident earlier in the night in Ilkeston where two cars were allegedly racing in the Quarry Hill Industrial Estate.

The car had driven off at speed and was spotted by officers coming into the city. As the car, which was being tailed by an unmarked police vehicle, came to a stop at a set of lights an armed response vehicle attempted to block the Renault in but the driver accelerated into BMW X5.

Two officers were injured in the incident and the BMW was left badly damaged.

The driver and two passengers ran away from the vehicle with two being detained following a short chase, however, neither were the driver.

Officers are now appealing for help identifying the driver and are asking for anyone with information to contact the force using any of the below methods, including reference 20*638241 in correspondence:
