We're appealing for information after an alleged public order incident in Glossop late on Saturday evening.

We were called just after 11.40pm on 18 July to report that a large group of youths had gathered in High Street East, near the Prince of Wales pub. The caller stated that she had been prevented from accessing her drive and her husband had been assaulted.

The group, understood to be made up of teenage girls and boys, were also reportedly seen jumping on cars in the nearby car park.

On officers' arrival, the woman and her husband could not be located, but disorder broke out amongst the group and several police officers were injured.

Their injuries are not described as serious.

A 17-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly, resisting arrest and assaulting an emergency worker. He has since been released on police bail.

Enquiries into the initial assault, reported in the call, are ongoing and we would ask anyone with information about this to come forward.

We'd also like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident in which the police officers were injured.

Anyone with private CCTV, mobile phone or dash cam footage is urged to download it to a separate, secure device ready for officers to review.

Please contact PC Jordan Weakley and quote reference number 2*369798 in any correspondence.
