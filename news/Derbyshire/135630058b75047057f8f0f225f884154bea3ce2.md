Officers have issued an image of a man they would like to speak to about a public order incident in Derby, last month.

It was reported that a man and a woman were verbally abused and threatened by a man in a Peet Street shop on 18 January at around 11.30am.

Since the incident was reported officers have been following a number of lines of enquiry and have now released an image of a man, who they hope the public may be able to identify.
