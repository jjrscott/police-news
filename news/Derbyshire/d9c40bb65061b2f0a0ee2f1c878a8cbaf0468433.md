Can you help? Officers investigating a robbery in Langley Mill in which a motorbike was stolen, are appealing for witnesses and dash cam footage.

We were called to reports of a robbery at around 1.30pm on Friday, June 21, on Cromford Road near Asda. A man reported he was threatened and pushed off his motorbike by four men with their faces covered.

The bike, a red and black Suzuki GSX-S125, was driven off in the direction of Gladstone Street. It was recovered the following day in Ilkeston.

We are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident, or was driving in the area at the time that has dash cam installed.

Any footage that may be of use to officers should be downloaded onto another device and safely kept for officers to view.
