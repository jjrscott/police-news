Two people have been charged with modern slavery offences after a woman was allegedly forced into sex work in Derby.

The woman attended a Derby police station on Thursday (30 January) to report that she had been a victim of modern slavery.

Dan Ailincai, 52, and Angelica Stoica, 51, both of Havelock Road, Derby were arrested that evening.

The pair have now been charged with facilitating the travel of a person with a view to exploitation and requiring a person to perform forced or compulsory labour.

They appeared at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates Court earlier today and have been remanded into prison custody.

Detective Inspector Carl Chetwyn who leads Derbyshire Constabulary's Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Unit said:

"We take all allegations of modern slavery and human trafficking extremely seriously, as this is a hugely unreported crime that can have a devastating effect on victims.

"If you suspect that someone may be a victim of modern slavery and human trafficking, or have any information that may help us tackle this crime I would urge you to contact us using one of the contact methods below."
