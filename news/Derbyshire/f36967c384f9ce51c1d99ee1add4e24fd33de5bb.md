We are appealing for information after a woman was burgled by someone asking for cleaning work.

At around 3.30pm on Saturday 11 July, a woman visited the house of a couple in their 70s in Derby Road, Spondon.

She asked whether the couple would like a cleaner and when they declined, she asked for a glass of water.

As the homeowner went to get a glass of water, the woman entered the house and took a purse from the hallway before running off towards Asda.

We have released this image of a woman we would like to speak to. We appreciate the image is of poor quality but someone may recognise the distinctive top she is wearing.

Witnesses or anyone with information should please contact us quoting reference number 20*355021;
