Yesterday we appealed for information in relation to a call we received concerned for the safety of a woman in Five Lamps area of Derby.

The woman involved contacted us and officers have now visited her. She is safe and well and no criminal offences had taken place.

We would like to thank the members of the public who reported the incident in good faith and those who helped share the appeal.
