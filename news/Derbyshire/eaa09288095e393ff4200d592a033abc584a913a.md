A man who died following an alleged assault in Alfreton has been named as Robert Chaplin.

We were called to reports of an assault at around 10.40pm on Thursday 23 January at the Morewood Centre, in Alfreton Park.

On arrival, Mr Chaplin (49) was in a critical condition. East Midlands Ambulance service attended and he was taken to hospital where he died on Friday 24 January.

Mr Chaplin's family have now released this photograph of him.

An 18-year-old man, who was arrested on suspicion of murder last week, has been released on police bail with conditions while inquiries continue.
