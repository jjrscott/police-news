Today the new COVID-19 lockdown restrictions come into force.

It is up to everyone to ensure they are aware of what they can, and cannot do, in order to help stop the spread of the virus.

The full guidance, which you should read and make sure you understand, is available here: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-national-restrictions-from-5-november?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae#stay-at-home

Among the new measures that have come into place today are that:

 * You should stay home as much as possible and only leave for specific reasons
 * Where possible work from home but if you do have to go to work ensure COVID safe practices are followed.
 * Different households are banned from mixing indoors or in private gardens, unless in a support bubble.
 * Pubs and Restaurants are closed - but takeaways are allowed
 * Outdoor exercise is allowed with one other person outside of your household. Exercise should be taken locally to your home but you can travel in order to access an open space.

You are able to leave home for a number of other reasons including childcare, caring responsibilities, vets, medical appointments and if you are suffering from domestic abuse:

 * **Meeting others and care**

You can leave home to visit people in your support bubble, or to provide informal childcare for children 13 and under as part of a childcare bubble, to provide care for vulnerable people, to provide emergency assistance, attend a support group (of up to 15 people), or receive respite care. People can also exercise outdoors or visit an outdoor public place (see section 3).

 * **Medical reasons, harm and compassionate visits**

You can leave home to avoid or escape risk of injury or harm (such as domestic abuse), for any medical reason, including to get a COVID-19 test, appointments and emergencies, to visit someone who is giving birth or dying, to visit someone in a care home (if permitted under care home guidance), hospice, hospital, to accompany them to a medical appointment, or to go to the vets (or other animal welfare services).

Larger groups are able to meet for specific reasons and further information can be found at point 3 on the following page: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-national-restrictions-from-5-november?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae#stay-at-home

**Travel and Overnight Stays**

The specific points in relation to travel and overnight stays are detailed at points 11 and 12 on the following link: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-national-restrictions-from-5-november?priority-taxon=774cee22-d896-44c1-a611-e3109cce8eae#stay-at-home

**Remembrance Day 2020**

Many Remembrance Day events are taking place online this year, however, some events are still taking place but will look much different to normal.

Members of the public are able to watch an event but can only do so with members of their household or support bubble and must remain socially distanced at all time. The Royal British Legion is calling on the public to show their respect at home and we would encourage our communities to do so.

Remembrance Day services at places of worship will also not be able to happen due to communal worship being restricted - although celebrants are able to access building in order to broadcast a service to their communities.

The full details in relation to the restrictions around Remembrance Day events are available here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-authority-preparations-for-remembrance-sunday/local-authority-preparations-for-remembrance-sunday
