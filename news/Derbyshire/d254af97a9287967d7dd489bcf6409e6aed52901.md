We're appealing for information after a man was allegedly assaulted outside a takeaway in Willington.

The incident happened at between around 9.30pm and 9.45pm on Thursday 6 August, outside the Sun Hall Chinese takeaway on Twyford Road.

There was an altercation between the driver of a car parked outside the takeaway, a woman and a man, who was allegedly punched and suffered a cut to his face.

Although the incident took place early in August, our officers hope that as it was on the main road someone may have passed by and noticed the incident or may have dashcam footage.

Were you in the area around the time of the incident, did you drive past or witness the incident taking place?
