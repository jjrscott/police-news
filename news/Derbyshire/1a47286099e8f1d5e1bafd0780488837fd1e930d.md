Three men have been arrested following reports of an alleged burglary in Smalley.

At around 9.15pm on Saturday 6 March, we were called to reports of suspicious activity at a house in Main Road in the village.

Officers and a dog unit were sent to the area. One man was arrested in Main Road by a dog handler and two other men were arrested in the vicinity.

Items, which officers believe may have been taken from the house, have been recovered.

The men, who aged 28 and one aged 24, have been released under investigation while inquiries continue.

We are sharing this incident with you as part of Operation Derbyshire, which runs until the end of May. It sees officers and staff sharing with our communities the excellent work that is going on to tackle certain crime types in the county and support victims.

We recognise that many crimes have a devastating effect on the victim and those close to them, but they may not always be in the spotlight - these crimes, which you told us are important to you via the police and crime commissioner's public consultation, will be the focus for this operation.

The operation will highlight what we are doing to reduce speeding; tackle wildlife, heritage and rural crime and target community crimes like anti-social behaviour.

Operation Derbyshire will also highlight the work that we and our partners do to support victims and bring offenders to justice.
