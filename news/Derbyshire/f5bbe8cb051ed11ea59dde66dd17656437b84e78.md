The 15-year-old boy who died following a collision on the A6 at Ambergate has been named as Tomas Ball.

Officers were called to reports of a collision on the stretch of the A6 just after the Hurt Arms between Ambergate and Whatstandwell at about 8.40pm on Sunday, June 30.

A silver Citroen van was in collision with Tomas, who was riding a push scooter.

Tragically Tomas, who is from Ambergate, was pronounced dead at the scene. Our thoughts are with his family at this time and they are receiving support from specialist officers.

An investigation into the circumstances surrounding the collision is ongoing and officers are still keen to hear from anyone who may have information that can help with their enquiries.

In particular they want to hear from any motorists with dashcam devices who were travelling on the A6 at Ambergate between about 8.20pm and 9pm.

If you have any footage, or have any other information, call our collision investigation unit on 101 and quote reference 19*339465.
