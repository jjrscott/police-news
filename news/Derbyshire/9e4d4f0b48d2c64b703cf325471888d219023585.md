A road near Chatsworth is closed following a serious collision.

We were called to the B6012 at Beeley at 5.20pm today (Sunday 26 July) following reports of a collision involving a motorbike and a car.

The road has been closed between Pilsley and Rowsley and will be closed for some time while we investigate the circumstances of the collision and clear the scene. We are advising drivers to avoid the area.

This is all the information we are able to release at this early stage. Any witnesses, or anyone with information, should contact us quoting reference 992 of July 26.
