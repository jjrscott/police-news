There is currently a scene in place in Normanton Road, Normanton after we were called to reports that a man had been assaulted earlier this morning.

We received a call just before 8.45am to say that a man had been stabbed inside the Polanica shop.

On arrival, officers found a 41-year-old man with stab wounds. The man was conscious and has been taken to the Queen's Medical Centre for treatment to his injuries.

A man has been arrested in connection with the incident.

Officers remain in the area this morning carrying out enquiries and we would ask anyone with concerns or information to approach them.

We would like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or noticed anything suspicious in the surrounding areas around that time.

Anyone who was driving in the area with dash cam installed, or who has private CCTV nearby which may have captured events around the incident is also asked to contact us.

Please quote reference number 257 of 25 May in any correspondence.
