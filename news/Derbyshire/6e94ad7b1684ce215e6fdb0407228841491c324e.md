We're appealing for witnesses after a man was assaulted in Derby last night (Thursday 12 December).

We were called to reports that a 37-year-old man had been assaulted in Richmond Road, Normanton at 10.20pm.

It is understood that he was walking in the area when he was approached by two men who stopped him and offered to sell him a mobile phone. The man refused and was then assaulted with a broken bottle.

He was taken to hospital for treatment to his injuries, which have been described as not life threatening or life changing.

The attackers are described as white, with tanned skin and dark hair. They are understood to have been between 35-40 years old.

We'd like to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and may have information about this incident.
