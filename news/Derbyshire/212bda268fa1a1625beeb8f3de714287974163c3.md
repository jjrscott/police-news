As new measures come into place to manage the spread of coronavirus, we'd like to thank our communities for their continued support.

We'd urge everyone to visit the Government website to ensure that you are aware of the latest rules.

We must continue to work together to protect each other against the virus and the personal choices we all make are a key part of this. Please do the right thing.
