We're releasing the image of a man we'd like to speak to in connection with two purse thefts in Shirebrook.

CCTV appeal in connection with two purse thefts in Shirebrook

Both thefts took place at Aldi on Carter Lane, and the victims on both occasions were women aged in their 70s, who were shopping at the time.

The most recent happened around 10.30 am on Tuesday 16 February. A purse, containing cash, was taken from a trolley.

A purse was taken from a handbag that had been hanging on the front of a mobility scooter sometime between 9.25 am and 9.40 am on Monday 1 February. The purse contained bank cards which were then used at other places.
