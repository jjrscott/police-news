A 40-year-old man has been sentenced to 16 months imprisonment after sexually assaulting a woman in Darley Park on April 12 this year.

Christian Mihai, of no fixed abode, appeared at Derby Crown Court today and was also given a three-year restraining order, which prevents him from contacting his victim or visiting Darley Park, and a 10-year Sexual Offences Prevention Order.

Mihai approached his victim in the toilets at Darley Park Cafe and grabbed hold of her before kissing her hands with an open mouth, attempting to kiss her face, and rubbing himself against her before she managed to escape.

He was arrested on April 12 and charged on April 13.

Detective Constable Harry Bashir, officer in the case, said: "This incident had a profound and lasting impact on a vulnerable young woman, who was simply enjoying a day out with her family.

"Mihai went into the ladies' toilets intent on sexually assaulting an unsuspecting woman and, in doing so, he not only violated the victim in this case but also stole her ability to feel safe in public.

"I can only hope that today's sentencing offers some comfort to the victim and her family that Mihai can no longer hurt her or anyone else.

"At Derbyshire Constabulary we take all reports of sexual offences extremely seriously and as this case illustrates, will work swiftly to enable a conviction where this is deemed the best outcome for the victim.

"I would urge anyone else who has been a victim of sexual assault, or any other crime, to report it to us so that we can investigate."
