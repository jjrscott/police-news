A teenager has been robbed of his bike in Mickleover.

At about 3.25pm on Sunday 20 December, three friends were riding their bikes on the footpath that runs parallel to Homerton Vale, near to the park.

Three teens approached them and threatened them, punching one 17-year-old and taking his blue Giant branded mountain bike.

The group then walked off with the bike toward Mackworth Park.

The suspects are all boys aged around 16 or 17.
