A 15-year-old from South Derbyshire has today (Friday 11 December 2020) appeared, via video link, at Westminster Magistrates Court charged with two offences under the Terrorism Act.

He is charged with one offence of dissemination of a terrorist publication under Section 2 TACT 2006 and one offence of collecting information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism under Section 58 Terrorism Act 2000.

He was arrested yesterday and charged early this morning following an intelligence-led investigation led by CTP North East and assisted by CTP East Midlands and Derbyshire Constabulary.

He had previously been arrested, under the Terrorism Act, in September.

He has been bailed to next appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on January 22, 2021.

A 16-year-old boy from South East London was also arrested yesterday as part of the investigation. He has been bailed pending further enquiries.
