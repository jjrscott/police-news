Officers investigating a number of robberies in Derby have released CCTV images of three people they would like to speak to about the incidents.

The first of the robberies happened at 10pm on 21 February in Normanton Road outside a block of flats. The following day (22 February) we received three further reports: two of robbery and one of attempted robbery which happened between 8.45pm and 9.45pm in Leonard Walk, Osmaston Road and Babington Lane.

On each occasion, victims were approached by three youths who threatened and assaulted them, and phones, wallets and bags were stolen except in the Babington Lane incident where nothing was taken.

Officers believe the people pictured may be able to help with their enquiries, do you recognise the clothing they are wearing?
