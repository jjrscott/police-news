Our Assistant Chief Constable Paul Gibson has postponed his 208-mile cycle ride in aid of the charity Foundation Derbyshire.

On Sunday 22 March, Mr Gibson was due to join the High Sheriff of Derbyshire, Lord Burlington, to cycle Derbyshire's county boundary.

The event has been postponed in light of the current COVID-19 situation.

They now hope to complete the challenge in June, raising money for local community fund Foundation Derbyshire.

The team will start at Sudbury and travel through Whaley Bridge, South Normanton and Swadlincote, giving them the opportunity to visit organisations helped by Foundation Derbyshire.

They will stop off at Lifecycle UK (a bicycle refurbishment charity that trains HMP Sudbury prisoners to be bike mechanics), High Peak CVS and meet the residents of Whaley Bridge, who pulled together during the dam incident last summer. They will also visit the South Normanton-based SNaP Youth Project and South Derbyshire CVS Foodbank.
