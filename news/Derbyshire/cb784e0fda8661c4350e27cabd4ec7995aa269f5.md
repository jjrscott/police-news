Over the weekend, we've received a large number of reports alerting us to the fact that some pubs have still opened their doors to serve customers.

Please rest assured that we are looking into these reports, along with our Trading Standards, Environmental Health and local authority colleagues.

We would also like to make people aware that some pubs are still able to serve customers on a strict takeaway basis only - meaning people can still be served alcohol in carry out containers.

However in order to do this, those pubs must have 'off-sales' included in the terms of their license.

It is now against Government restrictions for any pub, bar, club, restaurant or similar to open their doors for people to stay on the premises, including in beer gardens.

We have dedicated licensing teams covering the entire county and officers are noting all licensed premises reported to be staying open.

Any licensee who fails to comply with the Government regulations and the terms of their license may be handed prohibition notices and potentially unlimited fines. They may also face the loss of their alcohol license.

It is our duty to try and limit the spread of coronavirus and we would urge everyone to abide by the social distancing guidance issued in the last week.
