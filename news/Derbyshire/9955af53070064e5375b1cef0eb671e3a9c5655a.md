We are trying to trace witnesses following an alleged incident at a pub which left a woman with a broken finger.

A member of staff at The Olde House, in Loundsley Green Road, Loundsley Green, tried to remove a customer at around 6pm on Sunday 19 January, supported by several other customers.

The man allegedly assaulted two women and a man at the pub. One woman suffered a broken finger and a man had a bite mark on his chest.

A 20-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of affray, questioned and released under investigation while inquiries continue.

We are trying to trace a woman and two men who were in the pub at the time and supported the member of staff.
