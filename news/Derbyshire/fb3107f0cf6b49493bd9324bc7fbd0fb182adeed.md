In the last hour we have received reports of some scam phone calls targeting residents in the Glossop area.

Please be alert and make any elderly or vulnerable people in your family aware of this scam because sadly, they are often victims.

The calls have been to landlines, by someone claiming to be from the serious fraud unit at a London based police station. They are investigating or have arrested someone for the unauthorised use of their bank card.

The victim is led to believe they cannot talk to anyone else about the call as it may jeopardise the police investigation.

If you receive such a call you should not give out any personal information and hang up the call immediately.

We know that this type of call can be linked to courier fraud.

This means a victim will be encouraged to withdraw funds from their bank account, give bank cards or make purchases to give to a courier arranged by the 'police officer.'

The police will never contact you asking for banking information or request that you withdraw money from an account, purchase anything to aid an investigation.

Fraudsters often target geographical areas where they know elderly or vulnerable people live, so we would ask that if you have family or friends who are vulnerable in any way that you make them aware of this scam.

If you, or someone you know, receives a call of this nature please contact us as soon as possible. We will then assess the area that is being targeted, alert the banks and endeavour to protect other residents to prevent any financial loss.

Should you receive one of these calls, we advise you to end the call, wait five minutes and ensure you can hear a dial tone before calling us on 101. To call your bank, please use the number found on the back of your card. All reports of this nature also need to be reported to Action Fraud 0300 120 2040 or online https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/
