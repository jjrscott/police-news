A man has been jailed for 18 weeks for spitting in the face of a custody officer.

Liam Bradshaw was sentenced at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court on Monday 14 December after admitting to assaulting an emergency worker the previous day.

Bradshaw (31), of Woodfield Road, Pinxton, was under arrest and was in a cell at Chesterfield Police Station when he pressed the call button in his cell.

A custody detention officer opened the cell hatch to speak to Bradshaw when he spat in the member of staff's face.

Sergeant Dean Tidd, who is a custody sergeant at the station, said: "This was an abhorrent and disgusting act. The role of the civilian detention officer is to care for people held in police custody.

"To spit in the face of someone whose job is to take care of you is reprehensible. To do this when we are in the middle of a worldwide pandemic of a highly contagious and deadly disease only makes it worse.

"I welcome this sentence, which reflects the severity of this crime."
