A body, thought to be that of missing man Robert Law, has been found in Derby.

Police found the body on the edge of Rykneld Park, off Burton Road, Littleover, during a search of the area this morning.

Formal identification has not yet taken place but we believe the body to be that of Mr Law.

His family has been informed and we would like to offer our condolences to them at this extremely difficult time.

Although our investigation is ongoing, we do not believe there are any suspicious circumstances.
