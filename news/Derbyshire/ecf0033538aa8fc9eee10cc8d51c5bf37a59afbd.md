An operation has been launched today that will focus on the positive work being undertaken to tackle offending across the county.

Derbyshire is a vast county that spans both rural and urban communities. Due to this the crime in both of those areas varies immensely.

The chief constable, together with the police and crime commissioner (PCC), has put together a plan, following the PCCs public consultation, to target four main areas that effect the whole of our county. Operation Derbyshire will aim to highlight the good work that is taking place and to share this with our communities.

The key areas which the operation, that will run from Monday, 11 January to Monday, 31 May, will focus on, are speeding, anti-social behaviour and rural, wildlife and heritage crime. Running alongside this we will also focus on our visibility in areas and supporting our victims.

Chief Constable Rachel Swann said: "I really want our communities to know that we focus on long-term problem solving, engaging, listening and responding. We then need to ensure that we let the public know what we've done - this is a really important part.

"Derbyshire is a diverse county that consists of broadly two halves, the rural county, and the urban towns and cities and our policing response aims to reflect this diversity.

"Operation Derbyshire seeks to ensure that regardless of which community people self-identify as living or working in, their priorities are taken seriously and are visibly addressed.

"During this pandemic our officers have had a part to play but I want to reassure the people of Derbyshire that we are still here to fight crime, proactively bring offenders to justice, and protect the most vulnerable from harm."

Hardyal Dhindsa, Derbyshire's Police and Crime Commissioner, said that the operation had been inspired by his consultation with local people. "Up and down the county, in every town, village and neighbourhood that I visited, people told me that they wanted the police to focus on these four key themes," he said. "I'm grateful to the chief constable who has worked with me to address these public concerns, and Operation Derbyshire is the result. It's important that people know that we are addressing the things that matter most to them and have confidence that their views are making a difference."
