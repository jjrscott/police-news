Burglars have broken into an elderly woman's home in Belper.

At around 3.45pm on Saturday 1 February a woman in her 80s was at her home in Kilbourne Road, at the John O'Gaunts Way end of the street, when she heard a noise and realised someone was inside the house.

They searched several rooms and took cash. The victim, who is partially sighted, said two men were responsible. She has described them as tall and slim.
