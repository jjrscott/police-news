The family of a teenage girl who has been missing for 11 days have asked the public for help to find her.

Sophie Walton was last seen on the evening of Sunday 10 May. She was staying with family in Nottinghamshire but left in the middle of the night.

Sophie is from Pilsley originally and has links to Chesterfield, New Whittington and Whittington Moor.

The 16-year-old is white, slim, 5ft 6ins tall and has long dark purple hair.

Derbyshire Police Safeguarding Officer, Emma Muse, said: "Sophie's family, as well as the force, are very concerned for her safety.

"Our first plea is to Sophie herself - if you see this please contact us to let us know you are safe. You can get in touch using any of the below methods. Our only concern is to make sure you are safe.

"Our second request is for members of the public who may have seen Sophie today. We have a number of sightings, which we are hugely grateful for, and while these have been followed up we do require further information."

If you know where Sophie is, or you have seen her during your daily exercise outside, please contact us quoting reference 302 of May 11.
