A 48-year-old man has died in hospital after he was arrested following an incident in Swadlincote last Wednesday.

Mark McVey, 48, who was from Church Greasley died in the early hours of Sunday morning (17 May).

He was arrested in connection with the theft of a white Mercedes Benz Sprinter Van in the A511 Burton Road on 13 May.

The owner of the van followed the Sprinter in a second vehicle and it pulled over further along Burton Road, near the junction with Sorrell Drive.

It is understood that Mark McVey was then assaulted and two men were arrested on suspicion of GBH on Friday 15 May. They were later released under investigation.

The same two men, aged 36 and 53, were further arrested this morning (Tuesday 19 May) on suspicion of manslaughter following Mr McVey's death. They remain in police custody.

Detectives investigating the circumstances which led to Mr McVey's death are keen to speak with anyone who may have witnessed an assault.

They would also like to hear from anyone who was driving in the area of Burton Road at the time, with dash cam installed, as this may have captured the incident.
