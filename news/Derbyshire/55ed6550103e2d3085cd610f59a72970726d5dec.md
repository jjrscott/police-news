We have closed a large stretch of St Peter's Street in Derby following a serious assault earlier this evening.

Officers were called to the city centre street after reports that a man had been assaulted by a group of youths, who then ran off.

The victim was taken by ambulance to hospital, where he remains in a serious condition.

St Peter's Street is cordoned off from the junction with East Street down to the area outside Barclay's bank, near the junction with Albert Street.

It is likely to remain closed for some time.

Officers investigating the circumstances surrounding the assault are appealing for any witnesses to come forward.
