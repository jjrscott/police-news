We are appealing for information after a heavily pregnant woman was allegedly assaulted in Ilkeston.

It was reported to have happened at around 4.45pm on Saturday 15 August, on Burr Lane.

The woman was walking along Burr Lane, in between East Street and the car park for B&M stores when she was allegedly approached by a group of four of five women, and was pulled to the floor and assaulted.

She attended hospital as a precaution and was understandably concerned by the incident.

The group of women are all believed to have been aged in their 20s, and one is thought to have had blonde hair and a lip ring.
