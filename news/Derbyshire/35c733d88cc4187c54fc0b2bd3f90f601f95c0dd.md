The body of a man has been recovered from the water at Walton Dam in Chesterfield this afternoon.

We were called to the scene just after 12.30pm and, together with Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service, removed the body from the water.

Our enquiries are in their early stages but we do not believe there to be any suspicious circumstances at this time.
