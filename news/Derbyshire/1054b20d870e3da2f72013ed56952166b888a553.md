People living in the Borrowash area, and the area around Elvaston Castle, will see an increased police presence in the area this evening.

We were contacted around 8.20pm by a resident who had discovered an item in his garage and officers have called the bomb disposal unit as a precaution.

There may be the need to carry out a controlled explosion in the area later tonight. If this takes place residents may hear a loud bang, but we want to reassure people that there is no reason to be alarmed.
