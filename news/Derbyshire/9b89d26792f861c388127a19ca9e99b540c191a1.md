Our officers are appealing for help in finding Matthew Collymore, who has been reported missing from his home in Derby.
The 50-year-old was reported missing earlier today and the last sighting of him was on Friday, at his address in London Road.
We are growing concerned for his welfare and want anyone who has seen him over the weekend or knows where he is now to get in touch with us urgently.
Matthew is black, about 5ft 7ins, of slim build and with black, shoulder length dreadlocked hair.
When he was last seen, he was wearing jeans, a black jacket and may be wearing what was described as a Rastafarian hat.
He may still be in the Derby area, but also has links to Birmingham, Reading and Leamington Spa.
Matthew may appear confused and disorientated, and unsure of where he is.
