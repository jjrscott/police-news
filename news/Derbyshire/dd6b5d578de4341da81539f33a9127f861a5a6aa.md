A specialist team has arrested more than 20 people and recovered thousands of pounds of cash and drugs in the last four weeks.

The Pro-Active Unit is based at Derby but targets criminals across the city, south Derbyshire and Erewash.

In the last four weeks, the team has made 23 drug-related arrests. Of these, 19 have been charged with a range of offences and drugs thought to have a potential street value of around £25,000 have been recovered. The team has also recovered £26,800 cash.

In one case, a 27-year-old drug dealer was jailed for four years. Jake Centkowski was stopped by the team on Monday, March 23. They saw him leaving an alleyway in Dashwood Street, Derby, with several drug users, holding cash in his hands.

They believed he had been dealing drugs and, after a short chase on foot, arrested him.

He was taken into custody and searched, where crack cocaine and heroin were found in his underwear.­­­

Centkowski, of no fixed abode, was charged with possessing both drugs with intent to supply.

He was sentenced at Derby Crown Court on April 21 after pleading guilty.

Detective Sergeant Kane Martin, of the Proactive Unit, said: "Our message to criminals is simple; we may be in lockdown but we will continue to target people who think it's acceptable to take and deal drugs within our communities.

"If you have information about drug activity in your area, please contact the police."
