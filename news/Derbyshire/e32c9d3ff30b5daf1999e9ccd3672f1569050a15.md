We have charged a man, who was displaying COVID-19 symptoms, after he allegedly went on an abusive 'rampage' through the A and E department at the Royal Derby hospital.

Our officers were called to the hospital on Uttoxeter Road, Mickleover yesterday, Wednesday, 8 April, at around 8.30am. We had reports that a man had bitten, punched and coughed on security staff, after they had intervened when the man had taken his mask off, threatened a nurse and started running around the hospital.

34-year-old Corey Harris of no fixed abode, was arrested by the attending officers and it is then alleged that he urinated in the vehicle that was taking him to the police station.

Mr Harris appeared at South Derbyshire Magistrates' Court today, Wednesday, 9 April, charged with the offences of Affray, Criminal Damage to the police vehicle and one of the security guard's Body Warn Video and two counts of Assault by beating of an emergency worker. He has been remanded in to prison custody and will appear at Derby Crown Court on Thursday, 7 May.
