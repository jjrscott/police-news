We have had several reports today (June 10) from people in Derby who have received phone calls from someone stating they are either DC Ryan or DC Clarke from the London Police. They claim to be from the Fraud Squad.

These calls are fraudulent. It appears that they are targeting landline numbers, particularly in the 01332 area code.

Tammy Barnes, Fraud Protect Officer for Derbyshire police, said: "This kind of crime preys on people's best intentions - they think they are helping real police officers, however, in reality they are being scammed.

"If you have received this type of call please contact us immediately with any information that may help us track down those behind this scam.

"If you are concerned about a relative or friend, please do not hesitate to speak to them and ensure they are aware of this particular fraud call."

If you have received a call of this nature, call us on 101. We are particularly keen to speak to anyone who made a note of the number the phone call was coming from.
