We are investigating what happened to a cyclist who was found injured in a Derby street.

We were called to Louden Street, near the junction with Depot Street, at around 7.10pm last night (Wednesday 16 September).

A 39-year-old man had fallen from his bike and suffered serious injuries to his head and chest. He remains in hospital.

We want to hear from anyone who witnessed what happened to the cyclist and we particularly want to speak to a potential witness who was driving a white car from Depot Street onto Louden Street at the time.
