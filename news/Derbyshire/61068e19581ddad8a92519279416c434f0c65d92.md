The team behind the force's motorcycle safety campaign UpRight Derbyshire has been presented with two national awards for the work they have been doing to keep bikers safe.

In less than a year, PC Tom Rowlands and the CREST team developed and launched the UpRight scheme, a motorcycle safety campaign which aims to upskill riders and make them more aware of how to keep themselves safe on the roads.

Last night, PC Rowlands was recognised by UKROEd (UK Road Offender Education) for his 'Outstanding Contribution to Innovation and Road Safety' in respect of the idea and creation, implementation and running of the UpRight Motorcycle Road Safety initiative.

UpRight sessions run alongside Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service's Biker Down, which teaches riders what to do if they are first on the scene of a road traffic collision - including when and how to remove a biker's helmet, how to perform CPR, and how to manage a scene effectively.

Alongside this award, Gemma Kennedy (CREST Data Researcher) also won in the 'Outstanding Contribution to Customer Service' category for her supporting work towards UpRight, and her work within the department.

CREST manager Darren Roberts said: "This is a great achievement for both Tom and Gemma, and it's great to see their work for UpRight getting the recognition they deserve. We've had nothing but good feedback on the sessions, and it's so good to see both Road Safety programs supporting each other - It really is collaboration at its best."

Both Tom and Gemma were presented with their awards on Tuesday evening at the National Conference in Manchester.
