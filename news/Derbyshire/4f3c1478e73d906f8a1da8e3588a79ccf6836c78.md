Two warrants have been carried out in Normanton this evening as part of an ongoing investigation into an alleged firearms discharge.
A number of officers, including our armed response unit, executed the warrants at two properties in St Giles Road and Sale Street.
The activity relates to reports of a firearms discharge in Moorway Lane, Littleover, just before 6pm last night.
No one was injured in that incident. We want to reiterate our appeal for witnesses and would like to hear from any drivers who were in the Moorway Lane area last night with dashcam footage.
If you can help, call us on 101 and quote reference 20*242303.
You can also call Crimestoppers and give information anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
