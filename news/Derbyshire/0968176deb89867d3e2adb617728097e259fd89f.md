A motorcyclist has died following a collision on the A50.

We were called to the eastbound carriageway between the Chellaston junction and the slip road for the A6 at Alvaston just after 8.15pm last night (Tuesday 11 February).

A motorbike had reportedly collided with a lorry parked in a layby.

The rider, thought to be a man in his 40s, died at the scene.

We want to hear from witnesses, or anyone who may have seen or been overtaken by the motorcycle prior to the collision.

We also want to speak to people who were driving in the area at the time who have dash cam footage.
