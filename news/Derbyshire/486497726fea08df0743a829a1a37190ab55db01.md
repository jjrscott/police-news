A cyclist has been left with serious injuries following a collision in Buxton where the car driver did not stop at the scene.

The collision happened at about 11.50am on Thursday 10 September in Station Road, close to the junction with Palace Road.

We would like to speak to the driver of a white Toyota Aygo, which is believed to have collided with the cyclist. The cyclist was left with a broken hip and he remains in hospital.
