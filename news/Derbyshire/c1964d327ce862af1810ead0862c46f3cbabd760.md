A 38-year-old Long Eaton man has pleaded guilty to two counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and one count of dangerous driving.

Martin Casey was behind the wheel of a Ford van which collided with a number of people outside the Kirk Hallam Community Hall in Kenilworth Drive on Friday 5 July, 2019.

Casey, of College Street, Long Eaton, appeared today at Nottingham Crown Court where he pleaded guilty to two counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. He also pleaded guilty to one count of dangerous driving following a collision between the same van and the community centre on 26 June, 2019.

Casey, who had been remanded in prison since his arrest last year, was remanded once more to prison ahead of his sentencing at the same court on Monday (13 July).
