A pensioner has been burgled in Allenton.

Sometime between midnight and 2.30am today (Saturday 12 September), a burglar used a ladder to access the upstairs window of a house in Elton Road.

The 79-year-old homeowner was in the lounge when the burglar came into the room, wearing dark clothing.

The burglar assaulted the victim, causing facial injuries, and stole a chain from his neck. He also stole his wallet. He then left the house, leaving the ladder behind.

The victim was taken to hospital. His injuries are not life-threatening.

We want to hear from witnesses, anyone with CCTV in the area or anyone who may have been offered the necklace for sale.
