Ten people have been arrested and six warrants executed during a morning of action to dismantle a gang allegedly involved in a county lines drug supply between Nottingham and Derby.

The six men and four women have all been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to supply drugs between March 20 and today.

They were arrested at houses in Derby, Nottingham and Reading this morning.

During the warrants, officers found more than 200 wraps of suspected drugs and a significant amount of cash.

Five men, aged 19 - 40 were arrested in Nottingham, along with three women aged 23, 26 and 27. A 39-year-old woman was arrested in Derby and a 22-year-old man was arrested in Reading.

They remain in custody and are being questioned.

County lines is a term used to describe gangs and criminal networks involved in the supply of drugs in an area separate to where the ringleaders come from.
