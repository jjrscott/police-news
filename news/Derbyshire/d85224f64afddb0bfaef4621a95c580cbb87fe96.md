We are appealing for information after a number of items were taken during a burglary at a house in Heanor.

On Sunday 9 February, a woman returned to her home on Darfield Drive to find that the glass on the upper panel of her rear door had been smashed.

She then realised that a diamond necklace and earring set (pictured) had been taken, along with a tennis bracelet, an eternity ring, and a black quilted Caviar shoulder bag (similar to the ones pictured).

It is believed the incident happened some time between 12pm on Saturday 8 February and 12pm on Sunday 9 February.

If you were in the area at the time, or have seen any of the items pictured for sale at a cheap price, please contact us quoting reference number 20*77026.
