A 23-year-old Derby man has been found guilty of the manslaughter of his brother.

Marcin Woznicki was arrested in Leveret Close, Chellaston, on Saturday, 21 July, last year.

At the scene, Marcin's 27-year-old brother Mateusz was found with serious injuries as a result of being stabbed and he was later pronounced dead at the scene.

Marcin, of St Clare's Close, Derby, was charged with the murder of his brother to which he pleaded not guilty.

Today, following a trial at Leicester Crown Court, a jury found him guilty of the manslaughter of his brother and he will be sentenced next week.
