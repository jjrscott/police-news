We are appealing to the public for information following a collision in Swadlincote.

At around 5.45am on Friday, May 31, a blue Ford Focus travelled up Darklands Road and collided with a garden gate and a hedge in Union Road.

Two people were interviewed by officers following the incident, however our enquiries are ongoing.

A van was travelling behind the car before the collision, and the driver kindly stopped and spoke to the owner of the property about what had happened.

Unfortunately we have no details for the man, who may be able to help with our enquiries.

If this is you, please get in touch using one of our non-emergency contact methods.

In addition, we would like to speak to anyone who was in the area that morning between 5.30am and 6am who has dash cam footage that shows the Ford Focus, or CCTV that covers the surrounding area.

Any footage that may be of use to officers should be downloaded onto another device and safely kept for officers to view.

Please quote the reference number 19000278169 and the name of the officer in the case, PC Emery, in any correspondence.
