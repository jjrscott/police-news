We are appealing for witnesses following a report of hate crime.

A 39-year-old woman reported that she was walking along Derwent Street in Derby at around 1pm on Thursday 30 January, when she was racially abused by a woman.

She then walked further down the road towards the River Gardens, where she was racially abused a second time by a man.

The woman who shouted abuse is described as being white, 5ft 7ins tall and in her forties. She had black hair tied in a long ponytail with a full fringe. She was wearing a dark skirt, black ankle boots with gold buckles, a polka dot top and grey puffa coat. She also carried a black back-pack.

The man is described as white, with light stubble and light brown hair. He is around 5ft 9ins tall, in his forties and was wearing dark coloured clothing.
