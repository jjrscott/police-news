Officers from one of our South Derbyshire Safer Neighbourhood teams have released images after an attack on a shop in Rosliston.

They would like to speak to the people in the image after Greenfields store, Main Street, was broken-in to in the early hours of Friday, April 19.

The men entered the rear of the shop by breaking through the roller shutter doors and then removed the front panel of the ATM in the store. It is thought that they were then disturbed by the alarm and made good their escape.

Do you recognise any of the men in the image?
