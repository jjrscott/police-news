We've issued a new image of a missing 13-year-old boy from Derby.

We are very concerned for the welfare of Zane Akinyemi, who was last seen at 9pm in St Anne's Close on Tuesday 30 June.

It is thought the teenager may be in the Derby city area.

He is described as 6ft 1ins tall, and of slim build with black hair and green eyes. He was wearing grey jogging bottoms when last seen.

Zane also has connections to the Shelton Lock area.

If you have seen Zane, or know where he may be, please contact us quoting reference number 1065 of 30 June.
