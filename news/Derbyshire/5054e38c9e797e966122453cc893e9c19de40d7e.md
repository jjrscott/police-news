A new police officer has become the latest face on the streets of Staveley, Hollingwood, Inkersall, Duckmanton, Middlecroft and Poolsbrook areas.

PC Sarah Parker, who has been a police officer for around 12 years, has spent the last eighteen months of her career on the response and investigation teams for the Chesterfield and Staveley areas.

Sarah was a police officer for South Yorkshire Police, working on their response and neighbourhood teams, before transferring to Derbyshire Constabulary.

She has spent time as a temporary Sergeant in Chesterfield, and before joining the police Sarah was a recruitment consultant.

Sarah also has a degree in Psychology and Sociology, and spent time travelling in Thailand, Malaysia, Australia and New Fiji.

PC Parker said: “Since moving to the role in Staveley I’ve been spending time getting to know the local community and the area, and also finding out about local concerns and issues.

“I really do enjoy being a police officer and has spent the majority of my career on the frontline, in response and neighbourhood roles. Being part of a neighbourhood team is all about finding longer term solutions to problems, and this is something which we will be hoping to achieve.”
