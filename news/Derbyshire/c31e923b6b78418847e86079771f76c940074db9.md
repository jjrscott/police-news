With the weather set to be nice this weekend, we're encouraging people not to ignore the current guidelines when getting together.

Across the country, confirmed Coronavirus cases in localised areas are starting to rise.

Last week saw new restrictions placed on a number of areas in the north of England and Greater Manchester, neighbouring the north Derbyshire border.

Over the last 20 weeks we have all come together to keep the spread of Covid19 down. We want to make sure that people continue to be as safe, protected and healthy as possible in Derbyshire, and that we don't see a rise in cases anywhere in our county and beyond.

With this in mind, and with all the recent changes in the guidelines we're reminding you of how you can help keep the infection rate down.

There are important things you can continue doing to avoid contracting the virus and passing it on.

They are:

 * Keeping your distance from people not in your household or support bubble
 * Washing your hands regularly
 * Wearing a face covering in shops, on public transport or when visiting the hospital or GP
 * If you have symptoms or are feeling unwell, get a test and do not leave home for at least 10 days.

It's important to understand that this virus has not gone away and that we're still in the middle of an epidemic. Coronavirus is still very much a threat that is still in circulation, and that is why we must follow guidance and keep the amount of interaction we have with people to a minimum.

At the moment, two different households can meet indoors but still need to keep their distance and keep windows and doors open where possible for ventilation.

Outside, you can get together with up to 30 people from two households or a maximum of six people from more than two households.

Up until now, face coverings have been essential in shops and public places, but from tomorrow (Saturday 8 August) it will be compulsory to wear a face covering in other indoor venues, such as cinemas and places of worship.

If people start to feel unwell they should remain at home for at least 10 days but should arrange to have a test within five days of developing symptoms.

Ring NHS 119 for an appointment at the nearest drive-through or walk-through centre, or you can request a home testing kit or book your free NHS coronavirus test here: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-and-tracing/get-a-test-to-check-if-you-have-coronavirus/

People who test positive will be contacted by the NHS Test and Trace team by email, text or phone.

They will be asked where they have been and who they've been in contact with. Tracers will then be in touch with close contacts to ask them to self-isolate for 14 days.
