Officers want to speak to witnesses to the attempted robbery of a car in Barlborough.

The incident took place just before 9am, on Friday, May 3, in a car park off close to the Harvester Pub, at Tally's End, Barlborough.

The victim, a 28-year-old woman, was threatened by a man who demanded she hand over the keys to her car.

She handed them over; however, the robber did not know how to start the car. Leaving empty handed, he ran off towards Chesterfield Road where he got into a black BMW which drove off at speed.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed the incident - in particular anyone with dashcam footage is asked to download the video and keep it securely for an officer to view.
