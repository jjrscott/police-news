A 44-year-old woman has died following a fire in a flat in Buxton.

Officers were called to reports that a fire had occurred at a flat in Carlisle Road, Buxton, by colleagues from Derbyshire Fire and Rescue at 9.25am on Wednesday, 22 January.

Inside the address a 44-year-old woman was found with fatal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene. Enquiries are ongoing into the cause of the fire, however, at this time there are not believed to be any suspicious circumstances.

The woman's family has been made aware and our thoughts are with them at this time.
