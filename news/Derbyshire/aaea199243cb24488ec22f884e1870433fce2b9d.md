We're appealing for witnesses after a fatal collision in Stenson Fields last night.

At 10.35pm on Saturday 27 June we received a call to report a car driving erratically in Stenson Road and colliding with vehicles and street furniture.

The car, a black Mitsubishi Outlander, then collided with a blue BMW 1 series at the junction with Wragley Way.

The driver of the BMW, a woman, was taken to hospital with serious injuries, where she sadly later died.

The driver of the Mitsubishi, a 54-year-old man, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and drink driving. He remains in police custody.

Officers investigating the collision would like to hear from anyone who was travelling in the area at the time and witnessed the incident.

Anyone with dashcam or private CCTV installed nearby, is asked to review their footage in case it captured the incident.

Any footage which may be of use to officers should be downloaded to separate, secure device ready for them to view.
