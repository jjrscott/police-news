A car has been stolen from a house in Swadlincote.

At around 3.45pm on November 8, a blue BMW X5 M50d was stolen from a house in Clifton Road.

A Breitling Bentley watch was stolen from inside the house, along with an Omega Speedmaster Racing watch, a Tag Heuer watch and two diamond rings.

We are releasing these CCTV images of three men we would like to speak to about the crime.

We appreciate the images don't show the men's faces but the clothing may be enough to jog someone's memory.
