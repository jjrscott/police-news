We want to hear what matters to you.

We've got a survey of five simple questions about the area where you live, so you can tell us what issues you feel we should be tackling.

The consultation utilises our popular Derbyshire Alert system, giving people the chance to take part online and sign up to receive information from the police electronically in future.

Chief Inspector Becky Webster said: "Derbyshire Talking is going to give residents the chance to tell us what matters most to them in their local community. It could be that anti-social behaviour is worrying you, or perhaps you have information to pass on about drug dealing.

"We want your feedback and we will use it not only to shape our priorities in each neighbourhood but we will contact you with updates as to what action we have taken."
