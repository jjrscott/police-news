Officers investigating an incident in which a man was seriously injured after being struck by a vehicle in Whitwell, have released images of three men they'd like to speak to about it.

The incident, which involved a silver Mitsubishi Outlander, happened at around 3pm on Thursday 16 July on High Street, near to the Boot and Shoe public house.

The vehicle was left behind following the collision, and the offenders fled the scene on foot, leaving items including a mountain bike, alloy wheels and a compressor inside the vehicle.

A 38-year-old man sustained several broken bones and was admitted to hospital for treatment following the incident. He has since been discharged and his recovery is ongoing.

Officers would like to hear from anyone who recognises the three men (pictured) as it is believed they may be able to assist with enquiries.
