Officers are asking for help to track down two distraction burglars who stole cash and jewellery from an elderly woman.

The incident occurred at around 2pm on Wednesday, March 13, at an address off Longlands Lane, Findern.

An 82-year-old woman answered the door to a man who offered to clean her solar panels.

The man asked her to go to the bottom of her garden and, when they were at the bottom she saw another man who she assumed was also there to do the work.

The victim paid the first man £45 to complete the work and when she went back into her house found that money had been taken from her purse and along with a number of pieces of jewellery.

The first man, who knocked at the door, is described as white and around 25-years-old. He was slim around 5ft 6ins tall and was wearing a black suit and a black baseball cap - both of which had a red logo on them.

He was clean shaven, spoke with a Derby accent and had been seen in the area previously offering to take on gardening work.

The second man seen by the victim was wearing a green boiler suit and a flat cap. He had round chubby cheeks and looked around 30 years of age. He too spoke with a local accent and was around 5ft tall.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who may have been approached by this man – particularly if they have CCTV footage that may have captured their images.
