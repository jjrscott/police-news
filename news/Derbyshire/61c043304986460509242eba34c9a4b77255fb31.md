We have released a clip of CCTV footage as part of our investigation into the theft of numerous cast iron street signs from the Chester Green area of Derby.

Several signs were stolen from roads including Camp Street, Kirk Street, Old Chester Road, Chester Green Road, Marcus Street, City Road and Keys Street.

They were all affixed to the sides of houses or walls and will have taken the thieves some effort to remove.

Witnesses have reported seeing two youths on pushbikes in the area around the time of some of the thefts.

They were described as in their late teens, wearing tracksuits and hoodies with the goods pulled up.

In this short clip, two people are shown walking along Camp Street and stopping next to one of the signs, which was found to have been removed the following morning.

We want to talk to the two people shown in the clip.

We know the footage is grainy and does not help identify the men but we are asking people who live in the Chester Green area to check their own private CCTV footage if they have it.
