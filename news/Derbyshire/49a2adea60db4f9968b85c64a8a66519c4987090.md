Officers investigating a collision on the A6 near Rowsley in which a man died, would like to identify the rider of a Suzuki Hayabusa who may have witnessed the incident.

We were called to reports of a collision between a grey Audi A6 estate and a black Aprilia motorbike just before 4.30pm on Sunday July 7.

Sadly, the motorcyclist, a 46-year-old man, was pronounced dead at the scene. Specialist officers are supporting the man's family and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.

Officers would like to identify the rider of a dark-coloured Suzuki Hayabusa which was seen travelling along the A6 from Rowsley around the time of the collision. This person may have witnessed the incident, and may be able to help our enquiries.
