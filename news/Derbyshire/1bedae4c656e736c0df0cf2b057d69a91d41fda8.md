Officers investigating a sexual assault on a woman in Derby are appealing for witnesses who may be able to assist with their enquiries.

At around 9pm on Sunday, June 30 a woman was walking her dog through the underpass that links Cut Lane to Stores Road in Chester Green and noticed a man behind her. As she emerged from the underpass near to the race course (on the Chaddesden side) the man approached her and sexually assaulted her.

The woman fought back and the man then turned and ran away.

The man is described as white, and appeared to be in his mid-forties. He was around 5ft 10ins tall with a horizontal scar under one of his eyes. He was wearing a dark-coloured cap, a dark grey t-shirt and grey shorts.
