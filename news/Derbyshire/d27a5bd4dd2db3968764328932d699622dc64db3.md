One of our officers has returned to her home village of Littleover, Derby to take a post in-charge of Safer Neighbourhood policing in the area.

Emily Atkinson (pictured) has taken the role of temporary sergeant and has responsibilities for the Safer Neighbourhood teams in Littleover, Blagreaves, Mickleover and Abbey wards.

Emily, who started in her new role last week on Monday, February 11, has been a police officer for 5 years although she actually joined the force as a cadet in 2007.

Speaking of her new appointment, she said: “I was born and grew up in Littleover, attending local schools and had my first jobs in local shops so I feel very at home in this community and proud to work within it, it has always been a part of my life.

“For me, safer neighbourhood policing is about being visible, approachable and providing a policing service relevant to the issues in your local area.

“When you see my team out and about, talk to them and tell them what matters to you so we can make sure we’re addressing the problems that make a difference.”
