We currently have officers at a scene in Newbold, Chesterfield.

We were called to a block of flats at around 2am this morning off Devonshire Close in Newbold to concerns for the safety of a man.

A 25 year-old man was arrested and a device was found in an outhouse at the rear of the flats.

The block of flats is being evacuated for the safety of the residents whilst enquiries continue

Emergency services are at the scene together with the Ministry of Defence.
