Detectives investigating a fatal collision on the A515, near Buxton, are appealing for information about the incident.

We were called shortly before 11am yesterday (Wednesday 12 August) to a report of a collision between a black Kawasaki motorcycle and a white Citroen Relay van near Biggin.

Both vehicles left the carriageway during the collision and the motorcyclist, a man in his 50s, was sadly pronounced dead at the scene.

His family have been made aware and are being supported by specialist officers. Our thoughts are with them at this sad time.

If you were travelling in the area at the time and witnessed the incident, or in particular, if you have dash cam installed which may have captured it please contact Detective Sergeant Darren Muggleton quoting reference number 20*418338.

If you have any footage which may be useful to officers please ensure it is downloaded to a separate, secure device ready for them to view.
