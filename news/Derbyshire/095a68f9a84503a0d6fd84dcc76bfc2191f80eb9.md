Officers investigating an incident in which a member of McDonald's staff was verbally abused and physically assaulted want to speak to this pair of men.

The member of staff was not physically hurt but was left shaken by the incident which took place on Sunday, 15 December, at the restaurant in Hockley Way, Alfreton, at around 11.20am.

Officers want to speak to these two men who were in the area at the time of the incident. We are aware that the CCTV is of low quality; however, it does show what the pair were wearing even though it does not show their facial features.
