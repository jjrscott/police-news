Officers are re-appealing for information about a convict who absconded from HMP Sudbury earlier this month.

Rory Allen

Rory Allen left the open prison on Saturday 5 December with two other convicts. One has been recaptured, but the other two remain at large.

Thirty-three-year-old Allen was convicted of being concerned in the supply of cocaine and heroin at Worcester Crown Court in 2018. Allen is black, 6ft 2ins tall and has brown eyes, black hair, a black moustache and is of thin build.

While he has links to the Birmingham, Walsall and Wolverhampton areas, officers think he may be in the Bristol area.

Allen has "Tug" tattooed on his right arm and **should not** be approached by members of the public.

Anyone who sees Rory Allen, or knows where he is, should contact Derbyshire police immediately quoting reference 906 of 5 December:
