A murderer has today been sentenced to life imprisonment for beating a man to death in his own home and will serve a minimum term of 19 years.

Paul Steele, 53, was found dead at a house in Lapwing Close on December 9th last year.

A jury at Derby Crown Court found Talvir Singh Girn, 40, of Cloverdale Drive, Derby guilty of murder on Monday, following an almost four-week trial.

Kulvinder Singh Nath, 52, of Glencroft Drive, Stenson Fields was found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. He has been jailed for 14 years.

Girn and Nath were arrested at the time and charged on December 12.

Detective Constable Katherine Hargreaves said: "Mr Steele's death was the result of an extremely violent attack on a defenceless man in his own home.

"It's my hope that today's sentencing will bring his family some comfort and allow them to begin to rebuild their lives, in the knowledge that Paul's attackers have been brought to justice."
