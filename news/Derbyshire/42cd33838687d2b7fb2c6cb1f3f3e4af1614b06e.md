Safer Neighbourhood

07:00 13/11/2020

This week, starting on Monday, 9 November, has seen us unite with other forces in the fight against knife crime in Operation Sceptre.

As part of this and our on-going Project Zao, we have been working closely with retailers in Derbyshire to make sure they are aware of their responsibilities when selling knives.

Safer Neighbourhood teams across the county have been visiting shops, COVID-19 regulations aside, to deliver posters, leaflets and a booklet which reminds them of the legal responsibilities they must take.

Inspector Rich Keene explains: "We are very much aware that retailers, are in the vast majority of cases, selling knives to people who are using them for a perfectly legal activity, however we are also aware that people will try to obtain a knife for more sinister and illegal reasons.

"Retailers have a part to play, with the rest of us, to try and prevent this happening and the visits and advice booklet sets out these responsibilities.

"Whilst current COVID regulations make it more difficult at the moment, retailers can be assured, that as in the past, we will be checking that they are abiding by these responsibilities by conducting test purchases along with our colleagues from trading standards."

If any retailer in Derbyshire has not yet been visited, but would like a pack of posters and a booklet please contact their local Safer Neighbourhood team using any of the following non-emergency methods:

 * Facebook - send us a private message to /DerbyshireConstabulary
 * Twitter - direct message our contact centre on @DerPolContact
 * Website - complete the online contact form www.derbyshire.police.uk/Contact-Us.
