Derbyshire police officers have charged a Chesterfield woman with allegedly breaching a slavery order - the first time this charge has been made in the county.

Rasa Zubaviciute was handed a Slavery and Trafficking Risk Order (STRO) on Thursday 30 July at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court.

As a result of the order she is bound by a number of conditions including being forbidden from arranging accommodation for anyone other than immediate family, possessing passports, bank cards or documents of any other person, employing an individual for work without notifying Derbyshire police and ensuring they are paid the national minimum wage.

The 46-year-old, of Chatsworth Road, Chesterfield, was charged on 12 January with allegedly breaching the terms of the STRO. She is due to appear before North East Derbyshire Magistrates' Court on 26 February.
