Officers would like to trace the driver of a red Range Rover which was allegedly involved in a collision with another vehicle near Middleton-by-Wirksworth.

A white Ford Transit van was found abandoned on the Via Gellia (A5012) just before the turning to Middleton at around 8.50pm on Friday, June 14. The Transit van was badly damaged.

When the owner was traced, he reported he had been driving towards Cromford, when he had collided with the back of a red Range Rover, which had stopped in the road just after a nearside bend. The van driver stated that he had driven further down the road, where his vehicle broke down.

We would like to trace the other vehicle involved, described as being a red Range Rover Evoque or small Land Rover, with black bumpers, as we are concerned that it has been significantly damaged in this incident.
