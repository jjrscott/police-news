A man has been arrested after officers found a large amount of suspected cannabis at an address in Chesterfield.

Officers were called to a house in Hillside Drive, Mastin Moor on Wednesday 24 February at around 12.30pm after receiving a report of a strong smell of cannabis around the property.

On attendance they found a 24-year-old man inside and, following a search, recovered the cannabis.

The man was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class B drugs.

He has since been released under investigation, pending further enquiries.

We're currently sharing the work we do across our varied communities as part of Operation Derbyshire.

Operation Derbyshire runs until the end of May. It will see officers and staff sharing with our communities the excellent work that is going on to tackle certain crime types in the county.

Operation Derbyshire will also highlight the work that we and our partners do to support victims and bring offenders to justice.
