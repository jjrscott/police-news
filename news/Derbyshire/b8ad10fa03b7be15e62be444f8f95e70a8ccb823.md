We are supporting a national day of action to raise awareness of child sexual exploitation (CSE).

Today we are joining the national charity NWG in urging everyone to learn how to spot the signs of CSE and report anything suspicious.

CSE is a form of sexual abuse that involves the manipulation and/or coercion of young people under the age of 18 into sexual activity.

The national day aims to highlight the issues surrounding child sexual exploitation; encouraging everyone to think about, spot the signs of and speak out against abuse and adopt a zero tolerance to adults developing inappropriate relationships with children.

Chief Constable Peter Goodman said: "As a force, child sexual exploitation remains high on the agenda of issues that we deal with.

"We have a dedicated team of detectives investigating and gathering intelligence in relation to CSE, children at risk of exploitation (CRE) and the safeguarding issues that arise from these investigations.

"It's important that we continue to communicate and raise awareness of CSE and tell the public how they can spot the signs of this serious crime.

"We work with a number of partner agencies and one of those is Derby-based Safe and Sound. We support the valuable work that they do and the charity remains my chosen charity for the duration of my service as chief constable."

Further information on CSE can be found on the NWG website http://www.stop-cse.org/ or on the Safe and Sound website https://safeandsoundgroup.org.uk/
