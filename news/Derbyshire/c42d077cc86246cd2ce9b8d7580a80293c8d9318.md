A man has died following an assault in Derby and four people have been arrested.

Karl Taylor (43) was stabbed at a property in Uttoxeter New Road at about 1.20pm on Sunday December 8.

He was taken to hospital with serious injuries and we issued an appeal asking the public to come forward with information.

Mr Taylor remained seriously ill in hospital but died on Boxing Day.

We have arrested two men on suspicion of murder and a man and a woman on suspicion of assisting an offender.

All four remain in custody and are being questioned.
