Officers investigating an incident of racial abuse in Long Eaton are appealing for information.

It is reported that three men entered a shop in High Street at about 3.50pm on Thursday 23 July and spoke with the shopkeeper about making a purchase. The men then left the shop and made racially abusive comments to the shopkeeper.

As part of their investigation officers have released images of three men who they would like to speak to in connection with the incident.
