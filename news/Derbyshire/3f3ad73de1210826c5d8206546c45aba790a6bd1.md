A 23-year-old man has been charged with alleged drug offences after being stopped by officers in Derby.

Nathan Kiasala, of Wolfa Street, Derby, was stopped by officers from the South Division Pro-Active Team on 11 January while driving on his home street. Soon after being stopped and searched by officers his home was searched and inside officers found a large quantity of what is believed to be cannabis, along with a substantial amount of cash.

He was charged with possession with intent to supply cannabis and remanded into police custody. He appeared at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court the following day (12 January) where he was released on conditional bail. He will next appear at Derby Crown Court on 9 February.

We're currently sharing the work we do across our varied communities as part of Operation Derbyshire.

Operation Derbyshire runs until the end of May. It will see officers and staff sharing with our communities the excellent work that is going on to tackle certain crime types in the county and support victims.

Operation Derbyshire will also highlight the work that we and our partners do to support victims and bring offenders to justice.
