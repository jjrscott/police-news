We are releasing two images of a man we would like to identify, after a woman reported the contents of her purse were stolen on a bus in Brimington.

Although the pictures from the CCTV are of low pixel density, we hope they offer an impression of the man's build and what he was wearing.

A 29-year-old woman reported she had caught the bus on Lansdowne Road at 8.45am on Tuesday, July 16. She left the bus in Devon Drive at around 9am, and realised she had left her purse behind on the seat. She caught the same bus again on its return journey and found her purse, however cash and bank cards had been stolen from within.

The man, pictured, got on the bus at Barrow Hill and left it at Staveley. He was wearing a green cap, blue and white striped t-shirt with a collar, blue shorts, and black trainers and was carrying a newspaper.

Officers would like to speak to him, as he may have information that may help our enquiries.
