Officers investigating a disturbance in a Derby street are appealing for drivers with dashcam footage to come forward.

We were called to the reports of a disturbance involving a dozen men in Harvey Road at around noon on Sunday, June 9. There were no serious injuries and officers understand it to be an isolated incident.

Detectives are keen to speak to anyone who was driving along the road at that time and may have dashcam footage of the incident.

Anyone with video of the incident is asked to download the material and keep it secured for an officer to view.

Anyone with any information that can help detectives with their enquiries should get in contact immediately, either directly with the force, or via Crimestoppers.

In any correspondence please include reference 19*298742.
