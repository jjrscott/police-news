18 new student officers have completed their first year of the Police Constable Degree Apprenticeship course delivered in partnership with the University of Derby.

Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, the new officers finished their training three weeks early in order to get out into their new areas. Their trainer, Lynn Craughwell, praised them in their response to adapting and being flexible in their final week, before starting on section.

Later in the year, the students will have the opportunity to catch up on any remaining talks which they have unfortunately missed.

The students will be able to continue their course at university by working remotely with help from lecturers.

We wish them all the best for two more years of studies. Starting a new career can be challenging at the best of times, let alone when you are faced with protecting the public in a worldwide pandemic.
