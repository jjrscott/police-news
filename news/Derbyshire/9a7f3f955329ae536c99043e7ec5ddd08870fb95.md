We were called to reports of a disturbance involving a large group of youths in the Marlborough Road area at about 9.20pm on May 30.

A 16-year-old boy was found with serious injuries and was taken to hospital in Manchester. He has received treatment and is now recovering.

Two youths aged 17 and 18, and a 42-year-old man, all from Buxton, were arrested and have been released on police bail. A fourth person, a 17-year-old man also from Buxton, has also been arrested in connection with incident and released under investigation.
