Our Safer Neighbourhood teams in South Derbyshire have a new sergeant in-charge.

Sgt Mat Haslam (pictured) has joined the teams, replacing Graham Summers who has made a return to response policing.

Mat, has been a police officer for nearly 17 years, spending most of his time in uniformed policing roles in Derby and South Derbyshire.

Settling in to his new role, Mat said: “I am looking forward to speaking to the communities of South Derbyshire and finding out about the issues that affect and matter to them the most.

“The area covers around 320sq miles and is diverse in terms of towns, villages and countryside. I know there is a large rural community who can feel isolated so it is important that we work hard to deal with the issues that are affecting them.

“For me it’s also about targeting those people who choose to affect us and our communities the most and bringing them to justice”.
