Officers investigating a burglary at a house in Langwith Road, Bolsover are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the incident to come forward.

The owners of the house (a man and woman) were at home on the evening of Saturday 11 January between 5.30pm and 6pm when they heard a knock at the back door. The man went to open the door and two burglars forced their way into the property. One of them assaulted the man and forced him onto the sofa and threatened the woman who was also on the sofa.

The other burglar went through various rooms in the house.

A cream leather jewellery box, a quantity of jewellery, including two gold watches, and an amount of cash was stolen.

The burglars are understood to have been driving a dark-coloured saloon car.

Both burglars were men and were wearing black clothing, black hats and had their faces covered with only their eyes visible. They also both wore gloves which were red on the top and black underneath. One of the men was around 6ft tall and the other around 5ft 7ins.

Officers would also like to hear from anyone who was driving nearby with dash cam installed between the times of 5.20pm and 6.20pm that day.
