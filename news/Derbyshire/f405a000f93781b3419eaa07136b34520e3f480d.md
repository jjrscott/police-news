Detectives investigating the robbery of a 94-year-old man in Derby are appealing for witnesses to the incident to come forward.

The victim was walking in Derby Lane, Normanton, at 8.30am, this morning (29 January) when he was approached by a youth who pushed him over and attempted to steal a bag of shopping but only left with a small amount of loose change.

The 94-year-old suffered what are believed to be minor head injuries and is being treated at the Royal Derby Hospital.

A 13-year-old boy from Derby has been arrested in connection with the incident and remains in police custody.
