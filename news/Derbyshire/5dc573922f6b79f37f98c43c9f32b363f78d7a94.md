Officers are investigating reports of a burglary from a shed at Markeaton Park sometime between 5pm on Wednesday 10 March and 12.50pm on Thursday 11 March.

A large number of items were taken, including seven electric bikes, children's and balance bikes, helmets, cycling jackets and high visibility vests, along with tools and a number of other items.

Sergeant Daniel Potts, said: "Due to the recent thefts, we have increased our patrols in the local area and want to reassure the local community that we are doing all that we can to find the stolen items and those responsible. We hope by putting out these images that someone will be able to recognise the bikes and get in contact with us."

"The items which were stolen will undoubtably impact the local community as they were part of a council run initiative to give lessons to people wanting to learn how to ride a bike, they also offer an inclusive service with a range of specially adapted bikes for people with disabilities and are invaluable to those who use this service."
