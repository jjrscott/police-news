A cyclist has tragically died after a collision on the A52 near Markeaton Island, in Derby yesterday afternoon.

Officers were called to report the collision which involved a lorry and the cyclist just before 2pm on Tuesday 21 January.

Police and East Midlands Ambulance Service attended the incident and a 25-year-old woman was pronounced dead at the scene.

Formal identification of the woman is yet to take place, but her family have been informed and are being supported by specialist officers.

Our thoughts go out to them at this difficult time.

Ashbourne Road remained closed for several hours yesterday whilst collision investigation work was carried out.

The driver of the lorry was treated by paramedics at the scene and taken to hospital as a precaution.

Officers investigating the circumstances of the collision, would like to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed the incident.

In particular they are keen to retrieve dash cam footage from anyone who was travelling nearby.

If you have footage that may be useful for officers, please ensure it is securely downloaded to another device and kept safely for them to view.
