Chief Constable Peter Goodman will be joined by Derbyshire Police and Crime Commissioner Hardyal Dhindsa on a late night walkabout tonight, to see the issues facing police officers protecting the Night-Time economy.

The Commissioner and Chief Constable will visit Derby City Centre, joining police officers on duty in the city and meet volunteers working in partnership with the Force to safeguard local people.

The team will meet officers at 9pm before visiting the custody facilities and joining the team for a police briefing. They will then head into the city centre at 11pm to meet Street Pastors who are helping to deal with a range of issues in the Night-Time Economy including conflict resolution, drug and alcohol awareness and mental health, and discuss problems facing officers.

"Derby City Centre has a thriving nightlife and we are proud of the work going on to manage safety in partnership with other agencies," said Mr Dhindsa.

"This is an opportunity to see that collaborative work in action and understand how we might continue to make a difference, including the support we offer vulnerable people."
