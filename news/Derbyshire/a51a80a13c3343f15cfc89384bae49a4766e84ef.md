Officers investigating a fatal collision in New Mills are seeking witnesses to the incident.

We were called to reports that a blue Skoda Fabia had been in collision with a lorry on Buxton Road, New Mills, at 4.10pm yesterday (Thursday, 12 September).

An 86-year-old man was pronounced dead at the scene and an 82-year-old man died after having been taken to Manchester Royal Infirmary - both were passengers in the Skoda.

The driver of the Skoda, an 89-year-old man, was taken to Manchester Royal Infirmary, where remains in a stable condition along with an 84-year-old female passenger who is currently in a critical condition.

The driver of the lorry, a 24-year-old man, was spoken to at the scene and there have been no arrests in connection to the collision.

The families of each of the people involved have been contacted and our thoughts are with them at this time.

Officers from the force's collision investigation unit are appealing for anyone who was in the area, close to the Goyt View junction with Buxton Road, and may have information that can assist with the investigation to come forward.

In particular they would like to speak to any drivers who may have dashcam footage that shows the incident or the moments leading up to it.
