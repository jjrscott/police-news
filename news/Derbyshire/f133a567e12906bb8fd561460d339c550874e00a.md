Following an investigation last year into sexual offences against teenage girls in Derby, a man has been sentenced to four and a half years in prison.

Mosab Alamin (29) of Pear Tree Road, Derby was charged with sexual activity with a child and pleaded guilty to offences against young teenage girls on December 20, 2018.

Warrants were carried out in April 2018 at two addresses in the Pear Tree area and 11 men were arrested for a number of offences.

He attended Derby Crown Court today, Friday, March 29, and also received a Sexual Harm Prevention Order and was placed on the Sex Offenders Register

Detective Inspector Andrea Parkin said: “This investigation centred on an address in Derby where girls were being invited to by men. The girls were prayed on and their vulnerability was exploited.

“As with any investigation the police do not work alone, officers worked with a number of partner agencies and ensured that safeguarding the victims was paramount and the offenders were brought to justice.”

Catherine Arkley is chair of Safe and Sound charity said: “Our specialist support workers have been part of the multi-agency team who have provided 121 support to the victims of these crimes.

 “This support will continue for as long as is needed to help these young girls come to terms with what has happened to them and to move forward with their lives.”
