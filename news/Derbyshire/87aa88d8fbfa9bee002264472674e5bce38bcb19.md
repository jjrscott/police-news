Today we are supporting National Day of Remembrance for victims of honour based abuse.

At least 12 murders a year are carried out in the name of "honour" in the UK and thousands more people are abused by members of their family.

We know that during lockdown people have been away from their usual support networks - whether that be school, work or their friendship groups - meaning that many people are not able to seek help through their usual routes.

However, as we move out of lockdown restrictions we want to make sure that people are aware of the ways in which they can report Honour Based Abuse and that the support is there for them.

Firstly, it is important that people are aware of what Honour Based Abuse is:

Honour based abuse is defined as 'an incident or crime involving violence, threats of violence, intimidation, coercion or abuse (including psychological, physical, sexual, financial or emotional abuse) which has or may have been committed to protect or defend the honour of an individual, family and/ or community for alleged or perceived breaches of the family and/or community's code of behaviour'.
