A motorist has been banned from driving after he refused to supply a sample of breath for analysis, after allegedly drink driving in Ashbourne last October.

On 24 October, officers attended the home of David Groves-Hunt, of Old Hill, after receiving a report that a man was suspected of drink driving. The 58-year-old was asked by officers to supply a breath sample but repeatedly refused and was arrested for failure to provide a sample. He once again failed to provide a sample in custody and was charged with the offence.

Groves-Hunt appeared at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates court on 4 January and pleaded guilty. He was handed a suspended prison sentence, required to perform 150 hours of unpaid work and, to pay costs, in addition to a 30-month driving ban.

PC Reece Frogatt, officer in the case, said:

"Motoring offences can be fatal and we will continue to do everything in our power to ensure that we work together with the Crown Prosecution Service to ensure that anyone committing them is held accountable.

"This result means that Derbyshire's roads are that bit safer and we would encourage anyone who suspects that someone is driving dangerously, for whatever reason, to report it so that we can investigate.

In our most recent enforcement work around drink driving in December, 188 breath tests were conducted and 37 of those were either positive or related to drivers who refused or failed to provide a sample of breath.

Those who refuse to provide a specimen of breath, blood or urine for analysis could face six months' imprisonment, an unlimited fine or a ban from driving for at least one year.
