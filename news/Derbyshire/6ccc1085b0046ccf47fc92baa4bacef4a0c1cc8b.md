We have been conducting knife sweeps across the county this week as part of a national week-long knife crime initiative.

Whilst our work this week is part of the national Operation Sceptre this is regular activity for our Safer Neighbourhood teams as part of Derbyshire's Project Zao.

We know that in order to minimise the risk of being caught in possession of a knife that some will take to hiding them in public places.

**This sweep was taking part in Spondon, Derby on Wednesday, 11 November**

The value of this tactic was brought in to focus when one of our officers investigating an alleged assault in Derby city centre found the knife, believed to have been used, hidden in a public place on Liversage Street.

The discovery was made after one of the 13-year-old suspects was spoken to and indicated that this is where he had hidden the knife.

Pc Amy Ratcliffe, who is part of the Derby City Safer Neighbourhood Team, explained: "Thankfully no injuries were caused in this incident as it is alleged that the knife was used to make threats, however we have had very similar incidents in the city centre that have had far worse consequences.

"We would also be worried about someone else finding a hidden knife, so it is part of our routine to conduct these types of knife sweeps to try and ensure that we can take these items, that can be used as weapons, off the streets."

The investigation in to this incident is continuing.
