An elderly man from Mickleover has been conned out of thousands of pounds after receiving a scam phone call yesterday.

The 80-year-old received a call from someone claiming to be a police officer from a fraud squad working at a London based police station.

Over several calls, the scammers made him believe he needed to go to the bank to withdraw the cash, which they then claimed was fake and arranged for a courier to collect the so-called 'fake' notes from him.

This is known as courier fraud, and we've had several reports from residents in different parts of the county about calls like these.

Please be alert and make any elderly or vulnerable people in your family aware of this scam because sadly, they are often victims. Fraudsters often target geographical areas where they know elderly or vulnerable people live.

The police will never contact you asking for banking information or request that you withdraw money from an account, purchase anything to aid an investigation.

If you receive such a call you should not give out any personal information and hang up the call immediately.

If you, or someone you know, receives a call of this nature please contact us as soon as possible. We will then assess the area that is being targeted, alert the banks and endeavour to protect other residents to prevent any financial loss.

Should you receive one of these calls, we advise you to end the call, wait five minutes and ensure you can hear a dial tone before calling us on 101. To call your bank, please use the number found on the back of your card. All reports of this nature also need to be reported to Action Fraud 0300 120 2040 or online https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/
