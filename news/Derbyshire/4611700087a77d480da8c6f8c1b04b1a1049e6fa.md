A teenage boy has been charged with robbery following an incident where a dog was stolen in Derby.

It is in connection with an incident at the River Gardens at around 7.25 pm yesterday (Friday 26 February) where a man was assaulted. Cash and a Yorkshire Terrier dog were stolen.

The man was treated for facial injuries, including a fractured cheekbone, at hospital and the dog was reunited with her owners.

Three teenagers were arrested shortly after the incident and questioned by officers.

A 14-year-old, from Normanton, was charged this evening and remanded into custody. He is due to appear at court next week.

Two other boys who were arrested at the same time have been bailed pending further inquiries.
