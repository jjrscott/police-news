We have released images of two men we would like to speak to after an attempt burglary in Derby.

The incident happened on Osmaston Road, close to the city centre at around 7.30pm on Sunday, 31 May.

An attempt was made to break in to a flat and we would like to speak to the two men about the incident.

The report is being investigated by PC Harriet Dunn, who said: "I realise the images are not the clearest, however I think that someone may recognise them by either what appears to be a distinctive tattoo or the clothing."

If you think you know who either person is please make contact with Harriet using any of the following non-emergency methods and quoting reference number 20*276309:
