We are appealing for witnesses or anyone with dashcam footage after a van belonging to a wheelie bin cleaner was stolen while he was working.

A white Mercedes Benz Sprinter van was taken in the A511 Burton Road, Swadlincote, at about 1pm on Wednesday 13 May.

The owner of the van was able to follow the Sprinter in a second vehicle and it pulled over further along Burton Road, near the junction with Sorrell Drive.

A 48-year-old man was then arrested by police a short time later.

As part of our investigation into the incident, we are appealing for anyone who was driving in the area with a dashcam device to get in touch.

We also want to hear from anyone in the Burton Road/Sorrell Drive area who has private CCTV.
