An officer in our Long Eaton Safer Neighbourhood Team is issuing a re-appeal for information after a robbery last year has left the victim feeling un-safe in his own home.

The incident happened on Tuesday, October 16 2018, when a vulnerable man was forced to the cashpoint at the Co-op store on Grasmere Road, Long Eaton and coerced to take over £200 from his bank account.

The officer investigating, PC Claire March, would like to speak to the man in this image about the incident.

The incident happened on Tuesday, October 16 2018, when a vulnerable man was forced to the cashpoint at the Co-op store on Grasmere Road, Long Eaton and coerced to take over £200 from his bank account.

The officer investigating, PC Claire March, would like to speak to the man in this image about the incident.

PC March said: “We believe the vulnerable victim was being visited at this home by a man over a period of several months.

“Then on the day in question the victim reports being forced to go with this man to the cashpoint to remove money.

“Despite having CCTV installed and extra security measures put in place, the victim wants to move following the incidents as he feels unsafe in his own home.

“He is suffering from anxiety and although he is receiving support from his family, police and other agencies he fears he will target him again.”
