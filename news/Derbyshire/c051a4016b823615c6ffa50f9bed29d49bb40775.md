As we enter week nine of lockdown it's more than understandable if you're struggling - and it's ok to say that you are.

With not seeing family and friends as often as you'd like, struggling with living with social distancing measures, or feeling down with seeing the same four walls day in, day out, with this amount of time without our daily routines, it's ok if you're starting to feel burnt out - help is available.

Following tragic events in the celebrity world earlier this year there was large support for the 'be kind' message, to promote positive feelings between each other.

This is something we have seen continue during our time in lockdown, with so many random acts of kindness from friends, family, neighbours and colleagues which have helped to keep us all smiling.

From doorstep gifts, food parcel drop-offs to presents through the post, little things like that can make someone's day, and the support you've shown our offices during this testing time has made an incredible difference to their wellbeing.

So this week, why not take a minute to check in on your friends. Check in on your strong friends, your healthy friends, your loud friends, and your quiet friends. Send them a message or take 15 minutes to call them to let them know you are thinking of them and are there for them - it might be just what they need.
