We're appealing for information after an assault in Sunnyhill earlier this week.

It was reported that shortly before 8.30pm on Tuesday 9 June, a 37-year-old man answered the door at a house in Patmore Square to a man asking where the electricity meter could be located as it required some work.

The 37-year-old man went outside with the man to indicate where the meter could be found and saw another two men nearby.

He was then assaulted by all three men, who kicked and punched him.

The victim became unconscious following the incident and was taken to hospital for treatment. He has since been discharged but sustained serious injuries, including a broken nose and broken toe.

The men are all described as white.

The man who came to the door was around 5ft 7ins tall and wearing a high visibility jacket with red writing on. He had the bottom half of his face covered with a black facemask and had short, greyish-blonde hair.

The other two men were also wearing high visibility jackets, and hard hats. They spoke with what has been described as Irish accents.

If you were in the area at the time and witnessed the incident, have private CCTV installed in the area, or were driving there with dash cam installed which may have captured it please contact PC George Bickley quoting reference number 2*292854.

Please ensure any video footage is downloaded to a separate, secure device ready for officers to view.
