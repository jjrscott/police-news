Officers investigating an alleged assault at a supermarket would like to thank everyone who responded to the appeal.

Earlier this week, we shared pictures of a man we wanted to speak to after we received a report of an incident at Aldi, in Burton Road, Derby, on Friday 14 February.

Several people have contacted us with information and our investigation is ongoing.
