As we head towards the end of our forth week in lockdown, many of us are feeling the emotional strain of social distancing, change of routine, health and financial worries.

The world is not as it was, and that can be difficult to cope with at times.

It's no wonder that we can feel a range of emotions and be up one minute and down the next.

However, there are a wealth of resources available to help you and your loved ones as we stay at home to stay safe.

Public Health England's 'Every Mind Matters' campaign has been repurposed specially for all who want to try and keep on top of their emotional wellbeing at this tricky time.

Their website also includes resources for those with existing mental health conditions, and vulnerable groups such as the elderly who may be isolated from their closest friends and family.

There are tips on working from home, looking after children who may be fearful of what is happening, keeping on top of your own mental wellbeing whilst you stay at home, and a short quiz that can give you a mind plan of things which may help you cope.

There are also links to seeking urgent support, should you or someone you know need it.

You can access all these resources at: https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/

We can also help ourselves and each other by sticking together, despite being apart. You could check in over the phone, via text or by popping a note through a neighbour's door, particularly if they are elderly or vulnerable.

If you think someone you know may need support, please share the above resources with them and remember, we are all in this together.
