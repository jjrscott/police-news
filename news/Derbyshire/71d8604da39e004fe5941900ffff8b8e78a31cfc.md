Two boys and a man have been arrested in connection with an incident in Renishaw where two teenagers suffered stab wounds.

It happened around 7 pm on Monday 8 February near to the Miners' Welfare on Main Road.

The three boys, two aged 15 and another aged 14, were assaulted. The two 15-year-olds received stab wounds, while the 14-year-old was hit to the head.

None of the injuries to the boys, who are all from the Sheffield area, are believed to be life-threatening, and were taken to Sheffield Children's Hospital where they are recovering.

Two boys, a 17-year-old from Renishaw and a 15-year-old from Sheffield, have been arrested on suspicion of affray and wounding and released on police bail.

A 19-year-old man from Renishaw has also been arrested on suspicion of affray and wounding, and is currently in police custody.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who may have witnessed the incident or with any information which could help with their inquiries.

They would also like to hear from anyone in the area who may have CCTV or dashcam footage from around the time of the incident.

Inspector Rob Bowns, who is in charge of policing in the North East Derbyshire area, said: "There will be an increased police presence in the area to provide reassurance to the community who may be understandably concerned by this incident.

"We believe this to be an isolated incident and there is not thought to be a wider risk to the general public. There is a team of officers working on this investigation and I would ask anyone who may have witnessed the incident or with any information to come forward."
