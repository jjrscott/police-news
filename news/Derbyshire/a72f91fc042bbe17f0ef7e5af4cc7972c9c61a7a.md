We're asking for the public's help in identifying a man with a distinctive bat tattoo, who we would like to speak to about the use of stolen bank cards.

The cards were stolen in a burglary in Riddings last month and were then used on the morning of Sunday, April 21 in the Underwood and Selston areas of Nottinghamshire.

We would like to speak to the man - who has the bat tattoo on the back of his neck - about the incident and are asking him to come forward.

We also want anyone who recognises him from the CCTV images to contact us using one of the following non-emergency contact methods.
