A 17-year-old has died after falling ill in a Somercotes street.

We were called to Nottingham Road shortly after 1pm yesterday (Wednesday 28 May) following reports that a young man on a bicycle had fallen ill.

He was taken to hospital by air ambulance but sadly died.

We are investigating the circumstances surrounding his death and preparing a file for the coroner.
