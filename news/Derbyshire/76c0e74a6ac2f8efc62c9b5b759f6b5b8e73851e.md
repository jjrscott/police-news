People who are thinking of travelling a significant distance to towns like Matlock are being reminded of the current lockdown rules.

Local officers patrolling Matlock and Matlock Bath on the weekend of February 27 and 28 found both towns to be very busy and when they engaged with people, discovered some of them had travelled there from outside the county.

In some cases, people had driven to the area in cars with people who were not part of their household or support bubble.

Eight fixed penalty notices were issued to people found to be in breach of the legislation.

Sergeant Daniel Brooks, whose officers police the area, said: ""Although we are all looking forward to the easing of restrictions in the coming months, we are still in lockdown and we all have a responsibility to adhere to the rules in order to bring infection rates down and save lives.

"Matlock and Matlock Bath were very busy this weekend and officers will be on patrol again this coming weekend to engage with people and make sure they are abiding by the rules."
