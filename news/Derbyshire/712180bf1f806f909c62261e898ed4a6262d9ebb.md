The collision, between a black Fiat Panda and a 60-year-old woman, occurred at 2.25pm yesterday (6 January) in Derby Road at the pedestrian crossing close to the junction with Redvers Buller Road.

The woman, who is from Chesterfield, was taken to the Northern General Hospital, Sheffield, but passed away. Our thoughts are with her family and friends at this time.

At the scene, a 23-year-old man was arrested and has since been released under investigation as enquiries continue.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time and witnessed the incident or the moments leading up to it. Of particular interest are any drivers with dashcam footage that may have captured the incident.
