We're appealing for witnesses after receiving a report of an assault in Main Road, Bamford on Monday, May 6.

The incident is reported to have happened at around 3pm, near the St John the Baptist Church.

It is alleged that the driver of a black Vauxhall assaulted the driver of a brown Land Rover Vogue and threatened both him and his passenger with a baseball bat.

The Vauxhall driver then drove away from the scene. The Land Rover driver sustained minor injuries, which did not require hospital treatment.

Several people witnessed the incident, and we are keen to speak to them as part of our investigation. In particular, we would like to identify a lorry driver who stopped to help the victim.
