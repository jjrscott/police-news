We were called to reports of a fire at Ainmoor Grange Caravan Park in Stretton, just before 5.30am on Wednesday, March 27.

Around 40 caravans in a storage area were damaged. No-one was injured.

Following a joint police and fire investigation it is not believed that any accelerants were used to start the fire, however, it is believed at this time that it was a deliberate ignition.

Officers are making further enquiries into the cause of the fire and want to hear from anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious in or around the area of Mickley Lane or Morton Road at around 5am on March 27.

They are especially keen to speak to anyone who may have dash cam footage or CCTV that covers the surrounding area.

Any footage that may be of use to officers should be downloaded onto another device and safely kept for officers to view.
