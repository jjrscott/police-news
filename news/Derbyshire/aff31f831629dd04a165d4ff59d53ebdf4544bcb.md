Officers are appealing for the public's help to identify a white car believed to be linked to a robbery in Holmewood.

The incident, which took place on 13 May at 6.20pm, saw a 34-year-old man driving a black VW Golf robbed by three men in Park Road, Holmewood, Chesterfield.

The three men forced the man from the vehicle and drove off from the scene along Heath Road, in the direction of junction 29 of the M1. The car crashed 100m after the petrol station in Heath Road and the men, who were all wearing high-vis tops, ran off on foot taking with them a large quantity of money.

The car pictured is believed to be linked to the incident and officers are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen it in the area. It was pictured on dashcam footage parked in a small cut off (where the red dot is located below) from the A6175 near the M1 in Holmewood at 6.06pm.
