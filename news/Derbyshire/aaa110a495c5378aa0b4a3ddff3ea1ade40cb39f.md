We are searching for a 15-year-old boy who has gone missing from his home in Spondon.

Iddi Irakoze went missing from his home in Derby on Wednesday 16 December but has only recently been reported to us.

His disappearance is out of character and we are concerned for his safety.

He could be wearing Nike Air Force trainers, a black Nike tracksuit and he may have a black Nike backpack.

If you have seen Iddi, or you know where he is, please contact us quoting reference 622 of December 22.
