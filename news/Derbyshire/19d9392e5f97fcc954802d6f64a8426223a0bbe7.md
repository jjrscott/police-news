We're appealing for help to trace the driver of a car who did not stop after allegedly colliding with a man in Wirksworth.

It happened between 8.30pm and 9pm on Friday 2 October on Greenhill.

The 18-year-old victim and his friend were crossing the road, near to the junction for the StarDisc site, when a car is alleged to have swerved to avoid another car which had been turning on to Greenhill from the junction and hit him.

He suffered a sprained wrist and bruising to his hip and leg.

Officers would like to trace the drivers and passengers of either of the vehicles, or anyone who may have any information about the incident.
