A man has been arrested following a pursuit in Derby.

Shortly after 7pm last night (Wednesday 7 October) colleagues from Staffordshire Police told us that a suspected stolen Audi was traveling into Derbyshire.

Our roads policing officers saw the car on the A38 at Little Eaton and followed it along the A61 and back to the A38.

It collided with a police car and another car at the Little Eaton island before continuing northbound, stopping on the carriageway near Coxbench.

A 29-year-old Bristol man was arrested at the scene and during his arrest, a roads policing officer sustained cuts to his arm from broken glass.

The man was taken to custody having been arrested on suspicion of stealing the Audi, dangerous driving and failing to stop for police.

The officer was taken to hospital where he was given stitches.
