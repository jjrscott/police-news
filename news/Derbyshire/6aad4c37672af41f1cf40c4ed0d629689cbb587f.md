We are appealing for witnesses following the theft of a caravan in Dronfield.

Appeal after caravan theft in Dronfield

The incident happened sometime overnight between Sunday 14 February and Monday 15 February when thieves stole a 2017 Adria Adora Isonzo caravan, from Barnes Lane.

It is thought a group of several people may have been involved and were seen using a Volkswagen Passat and a silver-coloured people carrier, which was driven by someone with their arm in a sling.

Officers have now released some CCTV images and while they are small and not the best quality, we hope it may jog someone's memory or they may have seen similar vehicles and a caravan in the area.

If you have any information which could help with our inquiries please contact us using the non-emergency details below quoting reference 21*91537 and the name of the officer in the case PC Nick Burgin.
