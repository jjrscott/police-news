We're releasing images of a man and teenage boy who officers would like to speak to in connection with a theft from a shop in Hatton.

The incident happened at around 2.50pm on Wednesday 3 February when a man and a teenager entered a Nisa store in Station Road and stole a quantity of high value alcoholic spirits and cigarettes.

Officers from Derbyshire and Staffordshire police are also investigating links between this and two other thefts from shops in the surrounding areas.

The first happened at a Co-op store in Horninglow Road North, Burton-on-Trent on 12 January and the second at post office in Main Street, Hilton, also on 3 February.

If you recognise the people pictured, or have any other information which may assist officers with their investigation, please contact PC Matt Boyer quoting reference number 21*70361.
