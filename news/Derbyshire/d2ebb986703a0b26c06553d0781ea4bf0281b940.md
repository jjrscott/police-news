A man has been charged with arson with intent to endanger life after an incident in Heanor, last week.

Paul Berridge, 36, of Red Lion Square, Heanor was also charged with a further count of arson, criminal damage, and possession of class B drugs. He has been remanded into prison custody.

On 17 February, shortly before 3.30pm, officers received a report of a caravan fire in Red Lion Square. Later that afternoon a second fire was reported, at a flat, also in Red Lion Square.

Mr Berridge was subsequently arrested and charged.

He is due to appear at Nottingham Crown Court on 19 March.

Officers are now attempting to trace the owner of the caravan.

Does this belong to you, or do you know who owns it?

They are also keen to hear from anyone who was nearby at the time and may have information that could help with their investigation.
