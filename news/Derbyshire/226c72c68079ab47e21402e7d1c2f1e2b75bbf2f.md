Officers are appealing for information after two men tried to rob a pedestrian in Somercotes.

At around 8.45pm on Sunday, September 8, a 30-year-old man was walking along Parkside Road when two men on bicycles approached him.

One man showed him a knife and demanded his wallet, which he handed over. When they saw there was no cash inside, they handed it back and rode off.

One would-be robber is described as black, about 5ft 8ins tall and in his early 20s. He wore a grey hooded top, tracksuit bottoms and a dark grey scarf over the lower part of his face.

He rode a silver mountain bike.

Were you in the area of Windmill Rise or Parkside Road at the time? Did you see anything suspicious or do you have dash cam footage which may help the investigation? If so, we would like to hear from you.

Please quote the reference number 19000479641 in any correspondence and address it to the officer in the case, DC Claire Ollerenshaw.
