Officers investigating an attempted robbery on a bus in Spondon are trying to trace the passenger who witnessed the incident.

The incident happened at around 11.30pm on Wednesday, May 29.

It was reported that a man with his face covered boarded an I4 Trent Barton bus in Arnhem Terrace, near to the junction with Edmund Road.

The man threatened the driver and demanded money. The driver refused and the man left the bus.

The offender is described as being white, around 5ft 11ins tall and in his late 20s. He was wearing a green and black Adidas top, grey jogging bottoms, black sunglasses and a blue scarf.

There was only one passenger on the bus at the time of the incident, a woman sitting one row from the back. Officers would like this witness to come forward, as she may be able to provide information that will help officers with their investigations.
