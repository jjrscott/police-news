A man has been arrested after two people were injured during an incident in Farm Street, Derby, this afternoon.

At around 3.30pm today (May 6) we received a number of calls that two people had been assaulted close to the Sainsbury's store in Farm Street, off Burton Road, Derby.

Armed officers, who were on patrol in the area, were first on the scene and arrested a man.

Two people have been taken to hospital with what are believed to be minor injuries caused by a knife.

Currently, Farm Street and Boyer Street are closed at their junction and local diversions are in place. Officers will be in the area as enquiries continue into the incident and local people will see an increased police presence over the coming days.

The investigation is in its early stages and anyone with any information that may be able to help officers is asked to call 101 with reference 784-060519.
