Two men have been charged with affray after a report of disorder in a Normanton street, last month.

Addie Piggott, 27, and Martin Piggott, 25, of Princes Street were charged and remanded into prison custody last Friday (29 January) after being arrested earlier that week.

Addie Piggot was also charged with possession of an offensive weapon.

The charges come after officers received a report of an incident in which two men allegedly chased a third man and assaulted him with a metal bar, in Princes Street on 1 January.

The pair are next due to appear at court on Friday 5 February.

We're sharing this as part of Operation Derbyshire, a dedicated operation which sees staff and officers highlighting the excellent work that is going on to tackle certain crime types which you, our communities, told us you wanted to hear more about via the Police and Crime Commissioner's public consultation.

These crimes include speeding; wildlife, heritage and rural crime, and community crimes like anti-social behaviour.

Operation Derbyshire runs until the end of May and will also showcase the work that we and our partners do to support victims and bring offenders to justice.
