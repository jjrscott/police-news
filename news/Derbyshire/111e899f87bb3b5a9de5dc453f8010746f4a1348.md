We have the opportunity for you to make a real difference. To help your community, challenge yourself, and to discover what you are capable of.

Special Constables are a group of dedicated individuals who, after a hard day at work in their regular job, still have the enthusiasm and drive it takes to devote some of their free time to help others.

In return for your service, you'll receive excellent training, opportunities for your CV that you won't find anywhere else, and a sense of pride and achievement that comes from helping others.

Our Specials are fully qualified police officers with powers of arrest, and we are now looking to find our next intake of recruits.

Key dates are as follows:

ðŸš” Induction day: Friday 5 February 2021

ðŸš” Course start date: Saturday 6 February 2021

ðŸš” Course end date: Sunday 6 June 2021
