Officers were called to reports of a man acting suspiciously in Babington Lane, Derby, at 10.30am this morning.

At the scene a 37-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of a public order offence.

The incident was contained swiftly and there is no wider threat to the general public.

We would like to thank those in the area for their patience during the road closure and their help in the initial reporting of the incident.
