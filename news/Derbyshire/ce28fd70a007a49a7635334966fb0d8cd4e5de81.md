We have released a CCTV still of a man who officers would like to speak to about an assault in Friar Gate, Derby in the early hours of Sunday, 18 August.

Officers on patrol in Derby City Centre were approached at about 4am by a member of the public who told them a woman had been punched.

Officers found the victim near to the Dining Room restaurant.

The victim, who is 48, required hospital treatment due to the injuries she sustained during the assault. These include a broken jaw and the loss of several teeth.

Detective Staff Investigator, Suzanne Barnes, said: "Since this incident happened we have been conducting enquiries to support our investigation and are now at a suitable point to ask for the public's help.

 "The victim in this incident suffered serious injuries and is still undergoing ongoing hospital treatment, as a result.

"As such we are keen to hear from anyone who recognises the man in these images, as we believe he can help us with our ongoing enquiries."
