A 16-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences.

Officers from Counter Terrorism Policing East Midlands arrested the teenager at a property in the north-west area of Derbyshire at 7.20am today (18 February).

The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was arrested on suspicion of possession of information relating to terrorism and remains in custody as enquiries continue.

Detective Inspector Graham Prince, from Derbyshire Constabulary's Special Branch, said: "We will robustly investigate these matters and those involved in these types of alleged offences should be under no illusion that their activities will be subject to that approach."

"Over the past year, we have seen an increase in the amount of time that people, in particular young people, spending online.

"We also know that with the increased time spent online there is a greater risk of them being radicalised if not properly supervised.

"There are lots of resources to support parents and carers in their efforts to keep young people safe while online - some of which can be found here.

"But a few simple tips - such as taking an interest in their online activity, knowing the platforms or games they are accessing or using and checking in with them about the people they are meeting while online - can make a huge difference.

"I would also ask that if you notice a change in your child or any other young person, then please seek support and advice."
