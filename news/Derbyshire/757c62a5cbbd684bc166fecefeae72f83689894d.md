Officers are appealing for witnesses to an attempted street robbery to come forward to assist in their enquiries.

At around 9am on Monday, 23 December, the victim, a 25-year-old man from Lower Hague, was assaulted by a man who was being driven in a silvery blue car, similar to a Citroen Picasso.

The man tripped the victim to the ground and attempted to steal a laptop bag. The victim managed to trip the man, who dropped the laptop, ran back to the car and was driven away from the scene.

A number of motorists stopped at the scene and came to the victims' aid. Officers are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the incident and may have dashcam footage that captured the incident or the vehicle involved.
