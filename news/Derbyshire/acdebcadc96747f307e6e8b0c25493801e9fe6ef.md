Nine people have been arrested in Matlock on suspicion of drug offences.

Officers carried out a warrant in Overdale, Matlock on Wednesday, 4 December, 2019, after receiving information about alleged drug activity in the area.

Four women, two aged 18 and a 46 and 22-year-old, were arrested along with five men aged, 18, 22, 23, 24 and 44, all on suspicion of a number of drugs related offences.

At the scene a large amount of suspected class A and B drugs were seized, as well as an amount of cash and suspected stolen property. Designer clothing believed purchased through criminal proceeds was also seized.

Inspector Daron Abbott said: "I hope that these arrests show local people that we take their concerns seriously and we will act to prevent harm to our community.

"Anyone who believes criminals are operating in the area in which they live or work are able to report this directly to the police in confidence, or via the independent charity Crimestoppers."
