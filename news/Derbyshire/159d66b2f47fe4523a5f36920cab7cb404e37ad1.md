A woman has been assaulted while jogging along a canal path.

Just before 8am today (Monday 15 March) a 19-year-old woman was running along the canal path between Chellaston and Swarkestone Lock.

She was approached from behind by a man on a bicycle, who touched her buttock.

She has described him as white, slim and about 5ft 8ins tall. He wore a black hoody and light grey jogging bottoms.

Officers were dispatched the area at the time to search for the man but did not find him.

We are checking CCTV in the area and local officers are increasing patrols along the footpath.
