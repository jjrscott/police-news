A man was arrested in connection with drugs offences after a suspected cannabis grow was found at a house in Derby.

Officers executed a warrant at house in Rutland Street, Pear Tree, just after 11am today.

They found a large number of what are thought to be cannabis plants inside the house along with growing equipment.

A 22-year-old man was arrested at the scene and remains in custody.

Officers are still in Rutland Street making the property safe and as part of that work, people living nearby may have a power outage this evening.

Although this will be inconvenient, it is necessary for Western Power Distribution to cut the supply to the house for a short time. There is nothing for people to be concerned about.
