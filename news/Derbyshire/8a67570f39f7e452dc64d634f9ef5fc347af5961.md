Officers have identified the body of a man found in Ilkeston earlier this month.

The force was called on Friday 5 March to reports that a member of the public had found a body near a canal path in the town.

Following enquiries, officers have identified the man as Graeme Hill. Mr Hill's family have been made aware and our thoughts are with them at this time.

Officers are continuing to investigate the circumstances of the 60-year-old's death but there are not believed to be any suspicious circumstances.
