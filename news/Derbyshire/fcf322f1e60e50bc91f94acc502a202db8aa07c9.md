Officers investigating an alleged assault in which a man was stabbed are appealing for witnesses to the incident to come forward and help with enquiries.

The force was called to reports that a man had been allegedly assaulted by another man in Nelson Street, Swadlincote, between 6pm and 7pm on Sunday 15 November.

The victim, a 44-year-old man from Swadlincote, suffered a number of stab wounds during the alleged assault however he is expected to make a full recovery.

Officers, who have been conducting a number of lines of enquiry since the incident, believe that an incident occurred prior to the one in Nelson Street and are keen to hear from anyone who was in the area of Sea King chip shop in Darklands Road just before 6pm.

A 20-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incident on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and has been released on police bail as enquiries continue.
