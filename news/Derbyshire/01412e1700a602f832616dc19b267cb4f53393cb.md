People living in the Grassmoor, Holmewood, Calow and Arkwright areas will be seeing a new face on the streets as the local neighbourhood policing team welcomes a new member.

Katie Robinson is the latest Police Community Support Officer to join the local Safer Neighbourhood Policing Team.

Before becoming a PCSO, Katie was busy studying for A-Levels in Psychology, Media and P.E, while working as a football coach for Chesterfield FC Community Trust at the Proact Stadium, but was interested in a career in the police and noticed the role advertised.

Since joining the team, she has been busy getting out on patrol in the area, supporting police officers and has visited a local youth club as well as taking part in community engagement events.

PCSO Robinson said: “The role is like nothing I have ever done before but I am really enjoying it. I’m still getting out and about in my area to meet local residents and community members. The work of our team is all about community engagement and targeting neighbourhood concerns so if you have any concerns or issues which you think we could help with, please get in touch.”

Outside of work Katie, who grew up in the Tupton area, enjoys playing football.

To contact your local Safer Neighbourhood Policing team call 101, or send them a message through the My Local Police pages of the website, www.derbyshire.police.uk.
