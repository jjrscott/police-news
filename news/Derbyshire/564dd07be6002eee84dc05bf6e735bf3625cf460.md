We are renewing our appeal for information about Joshua Jones, who has now been missing from his Matlock home for a month.

Joshua left his home in Hurst Rise at 11.30am on Saturday 12 December.

Officers know that Joshua was in Sainsbury's in Matlock at 12.19pm on Saturday 12 December, having been in the Boyes shop at around noon.

We have CCTV images of him leaving Sainsbury's and we believe he may have been carrying an orange Sainsbury's carrier bag.

We are asking people in neighbouring counties to share this appeal, as Joshua may have travelled outside of Derbyshire.

Joshua was wearing a pair of blue jeans that day, together with a grey Superdry coat which is darker on the body with lighter grey sleeves. The coat has a hood that is bright green on the inside.

Officers have been checking CCTV in the town, reviewing dash cam footage, distributing leaflets in the area and following up reported sightings of Joshua.

We are grateful to everyone who has contacted us about Joshua in the last month and we would urge anyone with information, no matter how small, to contact the force using any of the below methods, quoting reference 518 of 12 December:

 * Facebook- send us a private message to /DerbyshireConstabulary
 * Twitter- direct message our contact centre on @DerPolContact
 * Website- complete the online contact form derbyshire.police.uk/Contact-Us.
 * Phone - call us on 101.
