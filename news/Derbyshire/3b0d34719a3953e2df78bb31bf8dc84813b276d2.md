We are trying to trace the driver of a car who was allegedly involved in an assault on the M1.

An Audi A3 and a Volkswagen Passat were involved in a minor collision on the M1 slip road at junction 29, which leads onto the A617.

Both cars pulled up on the hard shoulder of the slip road and the drivers got into an altercation.

The driver of the Audi alleges that he was assaulted.

We are trying to trace the driver of the grey Passat, which had the registration VK65 POF. It is believed the vehicle is in trade and therefore not insured to a specific driver. Our officers are conducting inquiries to establish which dealer currently owns the vehicle but in the meantime, we are turning to the public for their help to identify the driver.

He has been described as white, in his mid-50s and 5ft 11ins tall. He is of average build and had stubble. He wore black trousers that day and a fitted black coat with a hood.

The incident happened at around 12.15pm on Tuesday 21 January.
