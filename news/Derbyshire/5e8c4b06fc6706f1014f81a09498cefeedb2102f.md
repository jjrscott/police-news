We are appealing for help finding two teenagers who have been reported missing from their homes in Chesterfield.

Liam Saunders, 15, and 16-year-old Conna Bates were last seen in the early hours of Friday, 20 March.

The two friends may be in the Eckington area and we want anyone who has seen them to get in touch with us.

At the moment we only have a photo of Liam but will add one of Conna to this post when we receive it.

Liam is white, of medium build and with dark collar-length hair. He was last seen wearing a black Nike jacket, black Nike tracksuit bottoms and Adidas trainers.

Conna is white, about 5ft 4ins, of slim build and with short brown hair. He was wearing a black puffer jacket with reflective stripes on the arms, black skinny jeans and trainers.
