We have released footage of men we would like to speak to as part of an investigation into a series of burglaries in the High Peak.

Can you help identify these men?

Officers are investigating several break-ins and attempted break-ins, which we believe to be linked.

We are investigating the possibility that those responsible may have travelled to the High Peak from further afield, potentially Greater Manchester.

The crimes happened in the early hours of Tuesday 17 March. There were attempted burglaries at homes in Astell Way and Sovereign Way, Chapel-en-le-Firth.

There was then a burglary at a house in Hurst Crescent, Glossop. The back door was broken into and a set of keys stolen. The VW Tiguan was then taken from the drive.

Some time later, another house in Hurst Crescent was targeted, with a Peugeot taken.

This CCTV footage shows vehicles and people in Hurst Crescent that morning. We would like to trace the people pictured.

Witnesses or anyone ­­­­­with information about these crimes should contact us quoting reference 20000148671.
