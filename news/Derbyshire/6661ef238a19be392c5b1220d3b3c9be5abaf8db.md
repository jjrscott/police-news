While they were on patrol yesterday, officers from Matlock SNT were Caught On Camera... using a hopscotch that a little boy had painted on the floor outside his house!

CCTV

Ted Bailey-Bowler only just turned five last week and celebrated with a birthday in isolation, so on Easter Monday he used his new chalks (and a little help from Mummy) to make some fun for anyone going past.

We'd like to thank Ted's mum for sharing this footage with us, and to the PCSOs for hopscotching like no-one was watching!
