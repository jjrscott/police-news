Officers investigating the knifepoint robbery of a taxi driver are asking for any information that can help with their enquiries.

The incident occurred in Warwick Court, Somercotes, on Sunday, 8 September, at around 12.50am.

A woman got into the rear taxi and restrained the driver in his seat, while at the same time a man opened the passenger door, produced a knife and demanded cash.

A quantity of money was handed over and the drivers PDA was also taken - the pair then walked off in the direction of Belvoir Way.
