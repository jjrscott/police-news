Officers who are investigating a robbery at a Sandiacre convenience store, have issued an image of a man they would like to speak to in connection with the incident.

The incident happened at around 6.40am on 17 December when a man entered the store in Stanton Road and threatened the shop assistant before leaving with a quantity of cigarettes. He is described as around 5ft 6ins tall, of slim build and was wearing all black clothing.

Since that time officers have been following several lines of enquiry, but are now looking to the public to help them identify the person pictured.

Detective Constable Matthew Ward, said:

"We appreciate that this is not the clearest image and that the person's face is not visible, however we do believe that someone may recognise the clothing as belonging to someone they know.

"The jacket and jogging bottoms are North Face branded and the logo can just about be seen in this image.

"Does someone you know own similar clothing and have a similar build? Were they in the Sandiacre area around this time?

"If you have any information which could assist with our enquiries, please contact me via the details below."
