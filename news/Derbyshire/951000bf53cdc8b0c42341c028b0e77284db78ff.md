A man has been found guilty of causing death by careless driving after the car he was driving collided with a man in Clowne in July 2019.

John Hodgkiss, of Barlborough Road, Clowne, was convicted of the offence at Derby Crown Court today (Friday 26 February).

The 68-year-old was driving his Peugeot along Rotherham Road when he hit Andrew Thorpe at around midnight on Friday 26 July 2019.

Andrew Thorpe, who was 32, suffered life-threatening injuries and was taken to hospital in Sheffield but sadly died six days later on Thursday 1 August.

Detective Inspector Chris Marriott said: "Andrew was much loved by his family and our thoughts and sympathies remain with them all. I hope the jury's verdict today goes some way to comforting them following Andrews tragic death."

Hodgkiss denied causing death by dangerous driving, and a separate charge of murder, but was found guilty of causing death by careless driving.

He was sentenced to eight months imprisonment and disqualified from driving for 12 months.
