We're appealing for information after cash was stolen during an alleged burglary in Derby.

It is reported to have happened sometime between 10 pm and 11 pm on Wednesday 24 March.

A woman, aged in her 80s, had been watching TV with her husband at their home on Longstone Walk, off Spa Lane, when she heard a knock at the door.

She opened the door believing it to be a neighbour, but a man allegedly pushed his way in and knocked her over.

He stole cash from the property and then left.

The man is described as wearing a black mask, gloves, and black hood, which may have had a pink trim.
