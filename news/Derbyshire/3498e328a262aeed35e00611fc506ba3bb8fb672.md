We're appealing for witnesses after a man died in a collision in Bakewell Road (A6) near Rowsley yesterday (July 7).

We were called to reports of a collision between a grey Audi A6 estate and a black Aprilia motorbike just before 4.30pm.

Officers attended and were assisted by Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service, East Midlands Ambulance Service and an air ambulance crew.

Sadly, the motorcyclist, a 46-year-old man, was pronounced dead at the scene.

Formal identification is yet to take place, but the man's family have been informed. Our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.

Anyone who witnessed the incident, or who was driving nearby at the time and has dash cam installed, is asked to contact us quoting reference number 19*353568

If you believe you have video that may help the investigation then it should be downloaded to an external device and secured for officers to view.
