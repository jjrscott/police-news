We're appealing for information after a teenager and a young woman reported that a man had made lewd comments towards them in Derby.

The first incident happened at around 3pm yesterday afternoon (Monday 6 January) when a 13-year-old girl was approached by a man in Midland Road.

The second incident happened shortly before 4pm yesterday in Irongate, when an 18-year-old woman was approached by a man who also made inappropriate comments towards her. The man then ran away in the direction of the Flower Pot pub.

The man is described as black, aged in his late 20s to early 30s, of medium build and around 5ft 8ins tall. He was wearing yellow coat and dark-coloured trousers.

Anyone who witnessed these incidents, or who recognises the description of this man, is asked to contact Detective Sergeant Nicola Musson quoting reference number 20*10319.
