Officers are appealing for help identifying three youths who were involved in an incident that left the left a cyclist with a punctured lung.

The 43-year-old man was cycling along the bridle path off the A38 in Mackworth Park at around 10.30pm on Thursday 23 July when he spotted three young men aged between 16 and 18 sat on a bench.

As he cycled past the trio, two of whom were white and a third who was described as mixed-race with an afro hairstyle, one of the group reached out and grabbed the handlebars of the bike causing to him to fall from his bike.

The man managed to ride home but eventually had to attend hospital where it was found he had suffered a punctured lung.
