We are releasing the image of a man that we would like to speak to after a man's jaw was fractured on Sadler Gate, Derby.

The incident happened at around 11.30pm on Thursday 17 October when the 29-year-old victim was punched several times outside the Dog and Moon pub.

The attack appears to be completely unprovoked and we would like to speak to the man in the image about what happened.
