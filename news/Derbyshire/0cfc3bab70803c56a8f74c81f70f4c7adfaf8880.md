Detectives investigating a fatal collision on the A38 are appealing for information in relation to the incident.

Officers were called to reports that a man had fallen from the footbridge across the A38, just north of Markeaton roundabout, at around 8.20pm yesterday (24 Nov). While in the carriageway he was struck by a vehicle.

There are not believed to be any suspicious circumstances regarding the incident.

The man's family have been informed and our thoughts are with them at this time.

At the scene of the incident parts of a 2010, or newer, Ford vehicle have been found. Officers want to speak to the driver of the Ford, as well as any other drivers who were in the area at the time who may have information that can assist in the investigation.

In particular, drivers with dashcam footage that may have captured the incident are asked to download the video to a secure device for an officer to view.
