A 37-year-old man has been arrested following alleged racist communications.

Over the weekend the force received a complaint from a 49-year-old man that he received alleged racist and homophobic comments online.

Leo Maddocks, of Francis Street, Derby, was arrested yesterday (Sunday) and charged with sending an offensive/indecent/obscene/menacing message or matter.

The 37-year-old was remanded in custody and is due to appear at South Derbyshire Magistrates' Court today.
