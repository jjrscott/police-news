Officers were called to reports that the body of a woman had been found in Hadfield this morning (27 December).

The woman was discovered in a field behind Glossopdale Community College just before 8am and, following enquiries by officers throughout the day, it is not believed that there are any suspicious circumstances.

The family of the woman have been notified and our thoughts are with them at this time.

A file is now being prepared for the coroner.
