One of our Police Cadets is selling her artwork to raise money to donate to the NHS.

18-year-old Nicole Lander, who lives in Clay Cross and is based with our Chesterfield Cadet group, has designed personalised drawings around the theme of 'key workers' and is selling them through Facebook.

She has already sold 70 of her paintings and will donate all of the money raised to the NHS.

Nicole said: "I wanted to create a piece that represents the many key workers but also put a local twist into it and support my home town of Chesterfield by including the Crooked Spire. I came up with the idea at the beginning of April and posted it on my art page and other groups on Facebook, and from there I've received so much interest.

"I then realised that this piece of artwork would raise quite a bit of money to help the NHS in some way if I completed replicates of it."

Nicole aims to complete five pictures a day with many that are personalised - she can add other key workers, names etc to make it special for those ordering one.

She added: "I wanted to find a way of helping the NHS in some way, during this difficult time. I found that I had the resources at home to complete a lot of these pieces, so I knew I could make a difference just by being at home and drawing. Doing something I love, to help others and raise money. It's also helped me to gain a routine as I've finished school and that was a difficult thing for me."

Speaking about her time with the Cadets, Nicole said: "I have been a cadet for 5 years, I started cadets in Chesterfield when I was 13 years old in 2015. It has honestly been the best thing I've done/signed up to. I've had so many unique opportunities that I am very thankful for and I certainly will not forget them. I will be finishing my time as a cadet in July this year."
