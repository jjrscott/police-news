A man has been charged in connection with the theft of a van in Langley Mill.

It is in connection to the theft of a van from Bailey Brook Drive in the early hours of this morning.

A man was arrested shortly after the incident and taken into custody for questioning.

Jay Cosgrove, of Trent Boulevard, West Bridgford, has now been charged with theft of a vehicle.

The 18-year-old is set to appear before magistrates at Chesterfield Justice Centre next month.

We are sharing this with you as part of Operation Derbyshire, which runs until the end of May. It sees officers and staff sharing with our communities the work that is going on to tackle certain crime types in the county and support victims.

We recognise that many crimes have a devastating effect on the victim and those close to them, but they may not always be in the spotlight - these crimes, which you told us are important to you via the police and crime commissioner's public consultation, will be the focus for this operation.

Operation Derbyshire will also highlight the work that we and our partners do to support victims and bring offenders to justice.
