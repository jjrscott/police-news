Derby County fans are being reminded to remain COVID safe as they support their team ahead of the game against local rivals Nottingham Forest.

With restrictions in Derbyshire differing from area to area it is vital to ensure that fans are aware of what they can and cannot do as they support both their team and the fight against COVID-19.

Detective Chief Inspector Emlyn Richards, the officer leading Derbyshire police's response to the pandemic, said: "The East Midlands Derby is one of the biggest sporting events in our calendar.

"It is a game that has a huge amount of significance and I completely understand the desire to show your support alongside your fellow fans.

"However, as we have seen for the game earlier in the year, the way fans are able to follow the game is radically different with tonight's fixture obviously being played behind closed doors.

"These differences have now been compounded by the new tier system which means that within Derbyshire fans have different restrictions - whether supporting at home or at their favourite pub.

"We are seeing increasing rates across the county and country as COVID-19 begins to spread more quickly and it is vital that everyone of us does our bit to ensure that our family, friends and fellow fans are kept safe.

"So, the message is simple - support your team but please ensure you are doing everything you can to do so in a safe, responsible way and in line with the restrictions in your area."
