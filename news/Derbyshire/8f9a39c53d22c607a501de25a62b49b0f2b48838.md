We have recently launched a live chat facility on our website as an additional contact method for non-emergencies.

The feature was activated on 29 April, and can be accessed by clicking the live chat icon on our website homepage.

Users will get to talk to one of our call handlers who will be able to take a report, advise where to find information, or point people in the right direction to report an issue that may be dealt with by other agencies, such as local councils or trading standards.

This can all be done without the need to speak on the phone and complements a number of reporting forms which can already be accessed on our website for you to make us aware of issues which do not require an emergency response.

The live chat icon can also be found on selected pages throughout the site.

Live chat is available during the hours of 9am-9pm and the chat icon will only appear on the website when operators are available to take your query.

Superintendent Ady Gascoyne, Head of our Contact Management and Resolution Centre said:

"The live chat feature has been launched as a trial to aid the increased demand for service placed upon us during the current pandemic. Its use has grown naturally over the last four weeks and we are now in a position to roll it out officially to the public.

"Live chat operators will signpost the public to relevant information elsewhere, where possible, but can also record incidents from a live chat conversation where appropriate.

 "We hope that by providing more ways to contact us, we can offer a better and more efficient service."
