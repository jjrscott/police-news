Officers are asking for witnesses to come forward following a rape in Stenson Road, Sinfin.

A woman in her 20's was walking along the footpath that runs alongside Stenson Road from the direction of Grampian Way between 4am and 5.30am on the morning of Saturday, 13 July.

The attack took place on a grassed area shortly before the traffic light controlled railway bridge.

The man is described as an Asian man, approximately 5ft 7ins tall, of a large build and around 40 years old. He had thin dark hair on the side of his head with a bald top.

The victim told officers that he was wearing dark tracksuit bottoms and a dark hooded jacket with the hood worn down. He was also said to smell strongly of cigarettes.

Following the attack the man ran off in the direction of Glenmore Drive.

Residents in the area are likely to see an increased police presence and ongoing pro-active patrols will be taking place in and around the Stenson Road area. If you have any concerns then please speak to these officers.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who was in the area at time. In particular officers would like to speak to a dog walker who was seen in the area and any drivers who were in the area at the time and may have dashcam footage that can help officers with their enquiries.
