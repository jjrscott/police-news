Our Cadets are incredible young people. They commit themselves early to a policing life, work hard to be the best they can be, and help to spread the message about keeping safe to our communities.

Thank you from Cadet Leaders

Every Thursday night, our Cadet groups across the county usually meet. For the last 11 weeks they have not been able to do so, and instead have been keeping busy from home.

They've been taking part in arts and crafts, video chats, undertaking free online courses, and designing content for a Time to Smile Tuesday campaign which is being co-ordinated by our Youth Engagement Officer and posted on their Instagram account: https://www.instagram.com/derbyshireyouthfocus/

A few weeks ago, we told you about Senior Cadet Nicole Lander selling her pictures to raise money for the NHS. Other Cadets have completed litter picks in their local area, they've sat a PDSA Petwise course, and also joined in with a Forensic Facial Reconstruction ran by the University of Sheffield called Finding Mr X.

Some Cadets have written letters to local care homes to let them know they are not forgotten, and have been doing shopping for the elderly and vulnerable. They also joined in with socially distanced VE Day Celebrations, have written poems, created rainbows and window messages, and have been reporting suspicious activity they observed whilst out exercising.

In this video, our Cadet Leaders have a special message for all of their groups, thanking them for doing their bit over the last 11 weeks as we live with new socially distanced guidelines, and for their work every other week of the year where they all do us proud.

To our Cadets - thank you for everything you do, and for all the help and support you provide to our officers and staff. It never goes unnoticed.
