A teenaged boy who was stabbed in Derby remains in a stable condition in hospital.

We were called to Thornhill Lane, just off East Street, shortly after 2pm yesterday (Sunday 29 December) to reports that a 16-year-old boy was injured.

He suffered a single wound and was taken to hospital for treatment. He remains in hospital in a stable condition and his injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.
