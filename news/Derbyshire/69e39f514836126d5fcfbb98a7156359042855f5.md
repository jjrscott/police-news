A dispersal order has been put in place in Ripley town centre after disorder in the town last night (Friday 10 July).

Officers were called to reports of a disturbance on the Market Place at 12.20am. At the scene officers found a group of people numbering around 80 with a number of fights taking place.

No arrests were made at the scene; however, enquiries are ongoing to identify anyone who may have committed an offence.

Due to the large disturbance, the large number of people gathered on the Market Place and the ongoing risk posed by COVID-19 a dispersal order has been put in place from 6pm this evening (Saturday 11 July).

This order, which will be in place for 48 hours, will require anyone to leave the area detailed on the below map and not return within 24 hours. If a person refuses to leave, or returns within the 24 hours period, then they can be arrested.
