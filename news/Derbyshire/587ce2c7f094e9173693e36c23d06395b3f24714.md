An investigation into an alleged assault outside a shop in South Normanton has concluded that no attack took place.

Shortly before 9pm on Sunday, 6 October, we were called to reports of an assault outside the Premier Store in Market Place.

Three men were arrested on suspicion of assault but we are satisfied that they were not involved in what happened and they have been released from custody.

The 32-year-old man who made the allegation remains in hospital but his injuries are not serious and are not as a result of being assaulted.

We would like to thank everyone who contacted us with information and our inquiry into what took place last night will continue.
