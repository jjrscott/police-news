Motorists in Derby are being advised to allow extra travel time this weekend as part of the A52 will be closed in both directions for the demolition of a bridge.

The section will be closed from Friday May 17 to Monday May 20, for the demolition of Meadow Lane footbridge which links Chaddesden to the Wyvern and Pride Park.

The closure from Pentagon Island to the Raynesway junction will be in place from 8pm on Friday until 6am on Monday and affect both carriageways. Signed diversion routes will be in place.

There will be no access either to or from The Wyvern Shopping Complex or Costco via the A52, during the closure.

Pedestrians and cyclists will be able to use the Highfield Lane footbridge to cross the A52.
