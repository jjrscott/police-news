A 17-year-old boy who was arrested in connection with reports of sexual assault in Ashbourne, late last year, has now been eliminated from the investigation.

The teenager was arrested and released under investigation earlier this month.

Detectives are now reviewing all lines of enquiry after a woman reported that she was sexually assaulted on 20 December at 3.45pm near to St Oswalds Church on Mayfield Road. She was approached by a man who grabbed her arm and then exposed himself to her. He then ran off towards the leisure centre.

This report came after a further four similar reports were received in November and December last year.

The man is described as in his late teens to early twenties, white, with blonde short hair. He was wearing a hoody and orange work type trousers.
