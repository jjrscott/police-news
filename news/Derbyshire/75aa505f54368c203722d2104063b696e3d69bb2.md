We want to encourage those in the Belper and Duffield areas to be on their guard after we have had an increased number of reports about scam calls which aim to defraud people out of money.

The scam call comes from someone pretending to be a police officer who tells the person who answers, on some occasions that they are calling from the Serious Fraud Investigations Unit, and on others that they are an officer calling from London. The caller goes on to say that they are investigating the unauthorised use of that person's bank card and advises that the person should not tell anyone about this call as it may jeopardise the police investigation.

We're aware that a number of different names have been used by this scammer including DC Morris, DC Ryan, PC/DC Clarke and Sergeant Wiggins.

If you receive such a call you should not give out any personal information and hang up the call immediately.

We know that this type of call can be linked to courier fraud.

This means that victims will be encouraged to withdraw funds from their bank account or give bank cards to a courier, arranged by the 'police officer' making the call under the guise of 'assisting with a police investigation'.

The police will never contact you asking for banking information or request that you withdraw money from an account to aid an investigation.

Fraudsters often target geographical areas where they know elderly or vulnerable people live, so we would ask that if you have family or friends who are vulnerable in any way that you make them aware of this scam.

If you, or someone you know, receives a call of this nature please contact us as soon as possible. We will then assess the area that is being targeted, alert the banks and endeavour to protect other local residents to prevent any financial loss.

On receiving a call of this nature please terminate the call, wait 5 minutes and ensure you can hear a dial tone before calling 101, to call your bank please use the number found on the back of your card. All reports of this nature also need to be reported to Action Fraud 0300 120 2040 or online https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/

For further fraud advice and prevention information please contact your local Fraud Protect Officer Tammy.Barnes@derbyshire.pnn.police.uk

 ENDS.
