A 34-year-old man from Jacksdale, Nottinghamshire has been sentenced to 8 years imprisonment after stabbing a 20-year-old man in Ironville on March 24 this year.

Richard Hodgkinson of Sedgwick Street was jailed at Nottingham Crown Court on Thursday, June 13. As well as the 8-year-sentence for grievous bodily harm, Hodgkinson also received a 30-month sentence for possessing a bladed article and 2 weeks for criminal damage which are to be served concurrently.

Detective Constable Stuart Coutin, who led the police investigation said:

"It is my hope that this sentence sends a strong message to those considering carrying a knife. The victim in this case sustained life-changing injuries that day, thanks to an act of mindless violence.

"He will bear the physical and psychological scars of this incident for a very long time and is extremely fortunate to have survived.

"Carrying a knife is never acceptable and whilst it may be considered a status symbol or form of protection, the reality is knives cause irrevocable harm. Not only to victims and their families, but also to those who carry them, their family and friends, and to the wider community as a whole.

"To those who carry knives, my message is clear: stop and think twice about what you are doing.

"Police regularly run targeted patrols to identify those who may be carrying weapons and if we find you in possession of a knife, or any other weapon, we will ensure that you are dealt with swiftly and robustly to help us keep Derbyshire a safe place to live, work and visit."
