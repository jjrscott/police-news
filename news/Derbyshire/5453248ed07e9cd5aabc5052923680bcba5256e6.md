A robber has stolen a woman's bag as she walked to work.

The incident happened at around 8.20am today (Monday 23 November).

The 61-year-old woman was walking at the junction of Holbeck Close and Brimington Road, Chesterfield, when she was approached by two men.

One of the men snatched her black handbag, causing her to fall to the floor.

She has described the man who snatched the bag as slim, 5ft 6ins tall and in his late 20s. He has long brown hair and wore a khaki coat. The other man was very slim and looked slightly older.
