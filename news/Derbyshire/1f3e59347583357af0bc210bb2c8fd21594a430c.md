A man has exposed himself to two friends as they walked in Derby city centre.

The young women, aged 18 and 16, were walking along the Cornmarket at about 5pm on Wednesday 3 February.

They were approached by a man on a mobility scooter who indecently exposed himself to the two friends.

They walked away and reported the incident to two patrolling officers nearby. The officers searched the area on foot but did not find the man.

He is described as being white but with a tanned complexion, aged about 60 with short, grey hair. He wore a grey flat cap and a grey jacket and had a white blanket covering his legs. His mobility scooter was red.
