Officers investigating a high-value theft from a business in Alfreton want to speak to this man in connection with the incident.

Appeal to trace man in connection with high-value theft from Alfreton business

The theft occurred between 6am and 6.15am on Friday, October 16 and involved a blue Toyota Avensis drove into Clover Nook Industrial Estate. The driver and passenger left the vehicle, entered a business and took eight high value specialist furnace parts called retorts.

The pair placed the retorts in the car and rammed the gate of the industrial site in order to make their getaway.

Officers are keen to speak to the man pictured in relation to the incident - as well as any drivers who were in the area at the time and may have information or dashcam footage of the blue Toyota, which sustained substantial damage after ramming the gate.

It is thought the Toyota may have links to the South Yorkshire area.
