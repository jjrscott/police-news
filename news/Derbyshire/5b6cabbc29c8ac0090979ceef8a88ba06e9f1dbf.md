Op Relentless

A man has tried to rob a woman of her mobile phone in Simmondley.

At around 6.45am on Saturday 29 February, a woman was walking along Turnlee Road when a man approached her from behind.

He demanded her phone but when she refused, he ran off.

She has described him as white, 5ft 7ins tall and stocky. He wore a black waterproof jacket, grey combat style trousers and black shoes. He also had a scarf or face covering over his nose and mouth.
