Officers investigating allegations of assault in a Chesterfield nightclub have issued images of a man they would like to speak to, who was seen in the club at the time.

A 20-year-old woman reported to us that she was the victim of an assault, where she was hit with a glass, at The Association, Corporation Street, on Monday, May 6.

The incident happened at around 2am, and has been linked with a later report of assault, where a 20-year-old man has reported a glass was thrown at him.

The images were captured by CCTV and whilst we appreciate they are not of the best quality, we are hopeful that someone who was in the club at the time will see this appeal and be able to provide us with information.
