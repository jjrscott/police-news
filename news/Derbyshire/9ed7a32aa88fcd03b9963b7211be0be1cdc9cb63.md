A teenager has been jailed for 12 months after leading officers on a motorcycle chase through Ilkeston.

Dylan Lockley was seen by officers in Skeavingtons Lane, Ilkeston, on Saturday, 22 June, riding what was believed to be a motorcycle stolen just moments earlier.

The 18-year-old accelerated away from the Roads Policing Unit officer who pursued Lockley through the town.

Lockley raced away from the police car at speed, weaving into oncoming traffic and mounting the pavements before riding onto a public footpath where the pursuit ended.

However, with the help of National Police Air Service helicopter, Lockley was spotted nearby and was arrested by another member of the RPU team.

After being arrested for failing to stop, further enquiries found that Lockley had been involved in the taking of the motorcycle earlier that day in the town and another motorcycle that was taken the previous day, 21 June, in Langley Mill, during which the rider of the bike was assaulted.

Lockley, of Beatty Walk, Ilkeston, pleaded guilty to a number of charges including dangerous driving, assault by beating and two incidents of taking a vehicle without the owner's consent.

He was sentenced to 10 months in a young offender's institution for dangerous driving charge and two months for the assault - which will run consecutively with the dangerous driving sentence imposed at Derby Crown Court on 4 December.

For the two incidents of taking a vehicle without the owner's consent Lockley was sentenced to one month per charge which will run concurrently.
