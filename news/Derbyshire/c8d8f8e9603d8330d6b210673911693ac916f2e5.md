We're appealing for information after a serious collision in Ilkeston in the early hours of this morning.

We were called to a report of a collision between a lorry and a pedestrian in Nottingham Road, near to KRM Building Supplies, at 1.45am today (Tuesday 12 May).

The pedestrian, a 25-year-old man, was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre for treatment with injuries that are described as life-threatening. He remains in hospital.

The road was closed for a number of hours but has now re-opened.

An investigation into the collision is in its early stages and officers would like to hear from anyone who was driving in the area at the time with dash cam installed, which may have captured the incident.

They would also like to hear from anyone who was nearby and may have seen people in the Nottingham Road area, around the time of the incident.

If you have any information, please contact Sergeant Darren Muggleton, quoting reference number 2*239222.

Please ensure any video footage is downloaded to a separate, secure device ready for officers to view.
