We are investigating reports that two young children have been bitten by a pair of dogs in Whaley Bridge.

A mum has told us that she was walking with her children, aged two and four, on the bridge that leads from Wheatsheaf Road to Whaley Bridge Memorial Park, when the children were approached by two Jack Russell dogs and bitten on their bodies.

The youngsters suffered bruising and were taken to hospital for a check-up.

We are trying to trace the owner of the dogs, who described as a white woman in her 60s who wore a bright orange coat.
