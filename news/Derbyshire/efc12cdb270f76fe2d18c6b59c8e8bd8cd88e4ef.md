Officers investigating two armed robberies in Chellaston and Overseal are linking the incidents.

The first incident took place at the Bonnie Prince pub, in Swarkestone Road, Chellaston, at 1.10am this morning (20 January).

Three offenders broke into the building and stole empty cash boxes. Nobody was hurt.

The second offence took place at the Post Office in Lullington Road, Overseal, at 6.45am. Three members of staff were threatened by three men carrying what are described as shotguns.

The offenders stole cash and alcohol. None of the staff members were physically hurt and in neither incident were the guns fired.

The witnesses to the second incident describe the men as:

**Man 1 -** 5ft 6ins tall, of skinny build. Wearing black tracksuit bottoms, black tracksuit top, black mask covering facial features, blue eyes visible. English accent.

**Man 2 -** 5ft 4ins tall, medium build. Wearing a black fleece, black tracksuit, light green coloured trainers and a navy blue face mask.

**Man 3 -** 6ft tall, of skinny build. Wearing a pair of black tracksuit bottoms, a black tracksuit top and a black mask that covered entire face. He spoke Hindi fluently.

Officers are following a number of lines of enquiry but are keen to speak to anyone who may be able to help with the investigation.

In particular they want to speak to anyone who may live close to the two incidents and have CCTV that may show the offenders.

Also of interest to detectives are any drivers with dashcam footage at around the time of the incidents detailed above and that may have caught the offenders entering or leaving the two premises.
