Motorists in Derby can expect traffic delays this afternoon while we attend a serious collision near Markeaton island.

We received reports of the collision just before 2pm.

Ashbourne Road, from Princes Charles Avenue, to the roundabout, is closed at this time. We expect it to remain closed for some time.

Officers are at the scene diverting traffic.
