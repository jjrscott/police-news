Safer Neighbourhood

12:35 24/10/2019

We are offering cyclists in Derby the opportunity to have their bikes security marked for free.

The scheme works by marking the bike with a unique code linked to the owner's details on a secure database. If their cycle is stolen and subsequently found, we can use this code to ensure the bike is returned to its rightful owner.

The marking by www.BikeRegister.com is usually Â£12 but is completed free by the team.

Officers will be on Irongate, Derby between 10.30am and 3.30pm on Monday 28 October, as part of the 'Safer Together' event.

Sergeant Jamie Millard, in charge of the City Centre Safer Neighbourhood Team, explains: "The scheme works by marking and registering the bike with a unique code that is extremely difficult to remove.

"This registers the rightful owner of the bike so deters thieves from stealing it, as we are then able to very easily prove who the rightful owner of the bike is.

"It has been frustrating in the past when we have taken bikes from suspected thieves and not been able to prove who the rightful owner is.

"This scheme, along with using a heavy duty chain and lock is one of the ways of helping to prevent your cycle from being stolen.

"The event is being held during half-term so I would particularly urge parents to encourage their children to bring their bikes down to be marked."

The 'Safer Together' event also offers opportunity to see different strands of policing such as Armed Response, Police Dog Section, Rural Crime Unit, Drones Unit, Motorbike Safety, Cyber Crime and at 1pm there will be a demonstration of the use of tasers by our experienced trainers.

Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service will also be with us with one of their fire tenders and crew with details of how to stay safe from fire.
