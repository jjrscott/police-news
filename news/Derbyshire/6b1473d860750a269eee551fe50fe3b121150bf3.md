We are appealing for witnesses after men allegedly damaged a car in Shirebook and made threats against the driver and passenger.

At around midday on Friday 21 August, a man and a woman were driving near to the Colonade Shops in Field Drive when they say three or four other vehicles surrounded them.

They stopped their car and a group of men approached them and allegedly made threats against them and squirted a corrosive substance on the car, damaging the paintwork.

The two victims, one of whom is heavily pregnant, were left shaken by what happened.

We would like to hear from any witnesses, or anyone who was driving in the area at the time and who may have dash cam footage.

Four men, aged 19, 20, 22 and 24 have been arrested and released on bail while inquiries continue.
