Officers targeting crime hotspots across the county will aided by 15 new mobile CCTV cameras.

The cameras, which have been successfully trialled in the south of the county, have already provided key evidence in a number of serious crimes.

The trial, which began in December 2020, saw five cameras deployed.

Detective Inspector Matt Croome said: "These cameras have been absolutely invaluable in targeting a range of crimes across the south of the county.

"More than 10 investigations into offences such as drug dealing, robbery and road traffic offences have all been helped by footage captured by the cameras - and images of suspects have led to a number of arrests.

"The cameras have also been used in searches for missing people and in protecting vulnerable individuals in our communities."

The new cameras, which were approved as part of the budget uplift for 2021 by the Police and Crime Commissioner Hardyal Dhindsa, will be available to safer neighbourhood teams across the force in the coming weeks.
