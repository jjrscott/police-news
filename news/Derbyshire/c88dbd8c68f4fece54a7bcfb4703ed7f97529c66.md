Detectives investigating how a suspicious package arrived at the Intu Centre in Derby on Friday are appealing for witnesses.

We received a call shortly before 7pm on 21 August to report that a suspicious package had been found in toilets at the shopping centre. The centre remained closed overnight and was evacuated as a precaution.

Detective Superintendent Gemma Booth, who is leading the investigation said:

"We have been pursuing a number of lines of enquiry in relation to the incident and would like to thank the public for the support and patience they have shown since it was reported.

"A thorough investigation is currently underway to determine how the package came to be located at the Intu Centre.

"We are very keen to hear from anyone who may have information which could help our investigation.

"Were you in or nearby the Intu Centre between 2pm and 7pm on Friday and did you notice anything suspicious?

"If you saw something, no matter how inconsequential it might seem, I would urge you to contact us via one of the methods below."
