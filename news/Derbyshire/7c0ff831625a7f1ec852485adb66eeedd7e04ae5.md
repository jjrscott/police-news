We're appealing for information after an incident of arson in Glossop on Saturday evening.

We received a call at 11.30pm (on 6 March) to report that a glass bottle, containing a rag, had been set on fire and thrown at the window of a house in Combs Terrace, Gamesley.

Officers and fire crews attended and the bottle was found outside of the property, with the flame extinguished. A window was smashed during the incident and no one was injured.

Officers are keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and noticed anything suspicious.

They would also like to speak with anyone who has private CCTV installed nearby, which may have captured the incident.

If you have any information, please contact DS Nicola Bateman quoting reference number 21*129640.
