A 42-year-old man from Derby was arrested last night after our officers were called to this dramatic collision.

Our officers were called at around 9.30pm on Monday, 23 December, by residents of Woods Lane, Derby, after a Toyota Rav-4 collided with a parked car and was flipped on to its side.

The driver was arrested at the scene on suspicion of drink-driving and taken to St Mary's Wharf Police Station, where he is currently awaiting interview.

Insp Dave Neate, from the roads policing unit, said: "Incidents like this go to show the dangers and implications of having a drink and the getting behind the wheel to drive.

"We are just pleased that nobody was hurt in the collision and I would repeat our advice that if you are going to have a drink that you simply do not drive until you are sure that the alcohol has cleared your system."
