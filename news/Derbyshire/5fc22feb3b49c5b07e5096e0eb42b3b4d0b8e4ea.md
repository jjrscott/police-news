Officers investigating an assault where a care worker was allegedly licked have released an image of a man they want to speak to.

We have received a report that at 5.15pm on Tuesday 14 April, a 23-year-old woman was at the petrol station in High Street, Brimington, when a man approached her.

She was wearing her work uniform and it is alleged that the man thanked her for being a care worker, hugged her and licked her face.

We want to speak to the man in these pictures in case he has information which could help with our inquiry.

Witnesses or anyone ­­­­­with information should contact us quoting reference 20*191982.
