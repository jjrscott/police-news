Officers investigating the theft of a number of cars from a Derby garage are appealing for the public's help.

Five cars were stolen from a garage in Siddals Road between 1.30pm on Saturday 13 February and 8am on Monday 15 February.

Stolen were a grey Honda Jazz, a black Saab 9-5, a green Mazda 2, a red Renault Clio and another green Mazda 2.

Following enquiries, the Honda Jazz was found in Little Hallam Lane, Ilkeston, with the Saab 95 and one of the Mazda 2s found nearby in The Triangle.

However, the Renault Clio - registration ending NUW, and the second Mazda 2 - registration ending YVE - have not yet been found.

Of particular interest is anyone in the area of Little Hallam Road and The Triangle who may have CCTV from over the weekend - in particular, overnight into Monday 15.
