Officers investigating a collision are asking anyone with dashcam footage to come forward.

At around 2.55pm on Monday 20 April, a white Seat Leon was travelling along Boulton Lane, Derby. We believe the car was speeding and it left the road, coming to rest on its side.

A man has been arrested and interviewed in connection with the incident but we would like to hear from anyone who saw the car in the area. We also want to speak to anyone who has dashcam footage.

Anyone with information should contact PC Malachi Lowe, quoting reference 20*202017;
