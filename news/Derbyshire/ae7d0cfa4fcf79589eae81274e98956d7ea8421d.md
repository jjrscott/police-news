An investigation has been launched following numerous reports of a firearms discharge in Littleover.

Officers were called to reports of a dispute between two groups of men in the Moorway Lane area just before 6pm on Tuesday 12 May.

Members of the public also reported hearing what sounded like a gunshot, before the two groups left the scene at speed in two cars.

As a result of those reports, we launched an investigation last night and people will see an increased police presence in the area, including a temporary cordon at Moorway Lane.

We would like to reassure members of the public that we believe this to be an isolated incident and there is no reason for them to be unduly alarmed.

We also particularly want to hear from anyone who was driving in the area around that time and who has a dashcam device, or anyone living in the area with private CCTV.

Witnesses or anyone who has information that could help our officers should call us on 101 and quote incident 1017 of 12 May.

You can also call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
