A man has been arrested on suspicion of drug offences after an incident in Dronfield in the early hours of this morning (Friday 12 February).

Officers were on patrol in Dronfield around 12.20 am when a 4x4 sped away from them and collided with a telegraph pole.

The 29-year-old from Sheffield was stopped while trying to escape from the Land Rover and suspected drugs and cash were found.

A woman aged in her 20s was helped from the vehicle, and both the man and the woman were taken to hospital for treatment for injuries which are not thought to be life-changing or threatening.
