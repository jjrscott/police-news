Today, seven-year-old Mason Betteridge has been welcomed to Force Headquarters as a reward for saving his mum's life last year.

In October 2019, Mason was awarded a Chief Constable's commendation when he rang an ambulance for his mum, after she collapsed suffering an epileptic fit.

He dialled 999 telling the operator where they lived, and helped keep his mum from hurting herself as help raced to the scene.

Mason, who was just six-years-old at the time, braved the stormy weather today to be shown around an Armed Response vehicle, meet Police Dog Sybil, say hello to call handlers in our Control Room, and get exclusive access to our firing range where he enjoyed a run around.

Sergeant Nick Allgood, who arranged the visit, said: "Mason is a very brave young man who did his mum and dad proud that day. I heard the call that Mason made to East Midlands Ambulance Service and he handled the situation incredibly well. We wanted to reward him for his actions when he made that call, and it has been a joy to show him around our Headquarters this morning."

Mason's dad, Neville, added: "Mason has grown up with his mum's illness so he knows to call 999 first, then dad. It's been great to see his face today, we all really liked seeing the dogs and learning about what they can do. It's nothing like what you see on the tele you know!"

Everyone at Derbyshire Constabulary would like to congratulate Mason on his bravery, and hope he enjoyed his time with us today.
