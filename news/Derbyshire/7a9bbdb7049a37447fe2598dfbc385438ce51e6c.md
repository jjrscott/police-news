As more people across Derbyshire are shopping online this Christmas than ever before, it is important to be vigilant against fraudsters posing as parcel delivery companies.

Scam phone calls, phishing emails and text messages are in circulation, impersonating well-known delivery companies, claiming they have been unsuccessful in delivering parcels. Calls and messages may ask the recipient to pay a fee or provide personal details in order to rearrange a delivery slot.

Recently, an individual lost Â£47,000 in a DPD scam.

Typically, individuals are tricked into clicking on links, which appear to take you to a genuine website. These sites are used by criminals to obtain personal information such as your address, date of birth, mobile number or bank details - which are then used to commit fraud. In some cases, victims receive a phone call from the criminal pretending to be from their bank's fraud team, attempting to persuade individuals into moving their money to a safe account or in order to reveal their account passcodes.

If you receive a parcel delivery message:

 * Always access websites by typing them into the web browser (such as Google) and avoid clicking on links in emails.
 * Check delivery notifications carefully to ensure they are genuine.
 * Always question claims that you are due goods or services that you haven't ordered or are unaware of, especially if you have to pay any fees upfront. Consider whether you're expecting a delivery from the company named on the card.
 * If you receive a delivery card through your letterbox which you do not believe is genuine and which asks you to dial a premium rate number, contact the company direct, using a number you know to be genuine.

### Reporting scam messages

Customers can report suspected scam texts to their mobile network provider by forwarding them to 7726, and forward any suspicious emails to report@phishing.gov.uk, the National Cyber Security Centre's (NCSC) suspicious email reporting service.

Contact your bank immediately if you think you've fallen for a scam and report the offence to Action Fraud via their website https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/ or call 0300 123 2040.
