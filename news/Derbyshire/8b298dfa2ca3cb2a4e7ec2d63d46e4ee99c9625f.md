A man has today pleaded guilty to manslaughter after the death of a man in Chesterfield last year.

On Thursday, 27 June, Phillip Allen was assaulted on Birchover Court, Highfield Lane in Chesterfield.

He was taken to hospital with head injuries where he remained until he died on Wednesday, 17 July.
