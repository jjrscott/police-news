We are investigating an attempted burglary at a shop in Hope, which was thwarted by residents.

We received a call at 3.15am today to reports of two men trying to break into the Spa store, in Castleton Road.

They used electric tools to attack the metal security shutters but did not manage to break in. They drove away in a dark coloured car when residents went to investigate the noise and disturbed them.

We want to hear from witnesses, or anyone with information about the incident. We also want to hear from anyone who was driving in the area at the time who has dashcam footage. You can contact us via the following methods, quoting reference 155-080220.
