Officers are appealing for witnesses to an incident in which a man had his jewellery stolen after being threatened by two men.

The incident took place in Dale Road, Normanton between 10.05pm and 10.10pm on Wednesday 30 September.

The victim, a 31-year-old man from Derby, was sat in his car when he was approached by two men. The men got into the car, threatened and assaulted him by punching him to the head a number of times, before stealing a bracelet and watch.

Both the robbers had their faces covered and one was described as being chubby and wearing a pair of grey trousers and a black jacket.
