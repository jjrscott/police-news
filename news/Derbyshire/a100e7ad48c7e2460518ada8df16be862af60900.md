A body, understood to be that of missing man Michael Burton, has been found in Sheffield.

South Yorkshire Police found the body of a man at an address in Sheffield during a search yesterday afternoon (Monday 20 April).

Formal Identification has not yet taken place but we believe the body to be that of Mr Burton.

His family have been made aware and our thoughts are with them at this extremely difficult time.

A South Yorkshire Police investigation is ongoing and a file is being prepared for the coroner, but at this time we do not believe there to be any suspicious circumstances.
