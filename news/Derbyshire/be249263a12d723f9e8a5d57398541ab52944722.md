Detectives are appealing for witnesses after two men were stabbed in Newhall yesterday evening (Monday 9 March).

Officers were contacted by colleagues from the East Midlands Ambulance Service at around 4.45pm to reports that two men had been injured in an alleged assault in High Street, Newhall, close to the Sainsbury's store and the junction of Orchard Street.

Two men, aged 39 and 33, suffered stab wounds and were taken to hospital (one to Royal Derby Hospital and The Queen's Medical Centre) where they are expected to make a full recovery.

A 52-year-old man from Swadlincote has been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm and remains in custody.

Officers are keen to speak to anyone who was in the area and witnessed the incident - in particular anyone who may have dashcam video is urged to download and save the footage in order for an officer to view it.
