Officers are appealing for information after a member of staff was threatened at a store in Dronfield Woodhouse.

Police were called to reports of a robbery at a service station in Stubley Lane, Dronfield Woodhouse, at 5.40am, today (7 January).

A member of staff was threatened by two men who then stole a number of items from the store.

The member of staff was not physically hurt in the incident.

The two men, who were both wearing dark clothing, are described as:

Man 1 - 5ft 8ins tall, of stocky build, white and in his 40s or 50s.

The pair left the scene, after stealing a substantial quantity of cigarettes and alcohol, in a dark grey Ford KA.
