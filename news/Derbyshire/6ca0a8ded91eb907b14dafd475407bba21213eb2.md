Officers are appealing for information following a serious collision in Risley yesterday evening (Saturday 25 April).

Officers were called at 9.15pm to reports that a person had been struck by a vehicle and had been seriously hurt on Derby Road, Risley.

It is believed the vehicle was travelling from Borrowash towards Risley when the collision occurred just outside the village and did not stop at the scene.

The road is still closed and will be for some time as the investigation continues.
Officers want to speak to anyone who was in the area between 8.30pm and 9.15pm - in particular those drivers with dashcam footage.

They would also like to hear from anyone who has seen a car with damage to the front of the vehicle in the area - or further afield - whether that was being driven or parked.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact us immediately on the 101 number with reference 1422-250420.
