Two teenagers have been arrested, and a vulnerable victim supported, following action to dismantle an alleged county line drug operation in Derby.

Information was passed to police that a flat in Abbey Street, where a vulnerable woman lived, was allegedly being targeted by individuals who would use the property as a base for drug dealing - also known as 'cuckooing.'

On the morning of Tuesday 14 January, officers from the Pro-Active Unit in the city visited the flat. Two boys, aged 16 and 17 and from Manchester, were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs.

Substances, which initial tests suggest are crack cocaine and heroin, were recovered.

The teenagers were questioned and have now been released under investigation while inquiries continue.

Officers are working with several partner agencies to support the woman, who is being treated as a victim.
