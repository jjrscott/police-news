A motorcyclist, who died in a collision on the A6 near Rowsley on Sunday, July 7, has been named as Richard McSherry, from Glossop.

The family of Mr McSherry, who was 46, are being supported by specialist officers and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.

The collision, between a grey Audi A6 estate and a black Aprilia motorbike, happened just before 4.30pm.

Officers would like to identify the rider of a dark-coloured Suzuki Hayabusa which was seen travelling along the A6 from Rowsley around the time of the collision. This person may have witnessed the incident, and may be able to help our enquiries.
