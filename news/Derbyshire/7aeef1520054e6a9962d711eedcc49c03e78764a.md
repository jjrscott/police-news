Officers are appealing for information in relation to a male exposing himself in the Dronfield and Dronfield Woodhouse area.

A woman and her friend were out jogging when a male stepped out from behind a wall and indecently exposed himself.

On this occasion, the offender was described as being white, aged in his mid-30s about 5ft 8, stocky build, brown wavy hair could be seen under a beanie hat, wearing what were described as Harry Potter style glasses.

The incident occurred at on Tuesday 12 January 2021 at around 8pm near Gosforth Drive/ Pentland Road, Dronfield Woodhouse area towards the flyover.

We believe this incident might possibly be linked to several others recently reported over the last month.

A number of lines of inquiry have already been made, but officers are appealing for the public for their help.

Officers want to hear from anyone who may have been in the area at the time or anyone who may have come across a similar type of incident and are yet to report it.
