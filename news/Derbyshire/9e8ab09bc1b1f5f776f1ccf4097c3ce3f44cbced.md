A man has been handed a community order and three points on his licence after committing a hate crime in Ilkeston, last June.

David Doran of, Kingsway, Heanor pleaded guilty to sending an indecent or offensive communication and driving without proper control of a vehicle, at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates Court last November and was sentenced on 16 December.

The offences relate to an incident on 27 June in which the 39-year-old uploaded a video he had recorded to Facebook, showing him shouting transphobic and sexually aggressive abuse at a woman in Rutland Street. Doran could also be seen trying to provoke a reaction from passers-by as he recorded himself.

A member of the public reported the video to police shortly after it was uploaded and officers tracked down Doran who was later arrested and summonsed to court.

In addition to the community service and penalty points, Doran will also be required to pay costs and a victim surcharge as part of his sentence.

Sergeant Andy Kendall-Edwards who worked on the case, said:

"This is a pleasing result and one I feel sends a message that we will not tolerate hate crimes in Derbyshire.

"I would like to thank the member of the public who swiftly reported this to us and very much hope that this encourages our communities to report any such incidents to us, as soon as possible."
