The main road through Ault Hucknall, between Mansfield and Chesterfield, is currently closed following a collision between a car and a number of cyclists.

Officers were called to the scene in Ault Hucknall Lane at 12.10pm today to reports of a collision between a Seat Ibiza and five cyclists.

Four of the riders have received serious but not life-threatening injuries and have been taken to Chesterfield Royal Hospital while another rider, a man in his 50s, has suffered potentially life threatening injuries. He has been taken to the Northern General Hospital, Sheffield, by land ambulance after air ambulance staff landed at Tibshelf.

The 19-year-old driver of the Seat has been arrested on suspicion of driving whilst over the drug drive limit.

Currently Hodmire Lane is closed at Stainsby Mill and Ault Hucknall Lane is closed at the junction of Juke's Lane - this closure is likely to remain in place for some time and we would ask people to take alternative routes if they are attending Hardwick Hall, which is still able to be accessed.

Anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident and may be able to help officers with the investigation, in particular anyone with dashcam or CCTV, should contact Derbyshire police with reference 420-311219:
