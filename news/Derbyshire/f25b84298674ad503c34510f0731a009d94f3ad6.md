We've issued a new image of a man who is missing from Derby.

Buljon Palushi, who is 23, was reported missing on 2 July and had been seen in the early hours of that morning in the Normanton Road area.

Since then there has been a sighting of Mr Palushi in St Peter's Street in the city centre on 7 July, but we have still been unable to trace him.

We are concerned for Buljon's welfare and would urge anyone who has seen him to contact us.

He is white, of Albanian descent, 5ft 8ins, with short, dark brown hair and a short, dark brown beard.
