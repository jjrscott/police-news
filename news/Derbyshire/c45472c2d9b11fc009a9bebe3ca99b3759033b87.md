We are appealing for help to identify two men (pictured) who we would like to speak to about a break in at a Motocross store in Chesterfield.

At around 7:30pm on Saturday 12 October, two men entered Chesterfield Motocross on Holbeck Close, and stole an amount of cash, bike helmets, car keys and some airsoft weapons.

It is believed that the men left the area in a white Citroen Berlingo van.
