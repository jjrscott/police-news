Today, we should be enjoying the Derby Caribbean Carnival, with large crowds, colourful costumes and loud music, but as with many other events over the past few months, this year's celebration will be very different.

Instead, the carnival will be held online. Organisers have worked to bring the music, poetry, dancing and competitions to the comfort of your own home!

Chief Superintendent Dave Cox said: "The Caribbean Carnival is a brilliant event which has been celebrated in Derby since 1975. Our officers have always enjoyed taking part and meeting the community but this year will be different as the event moves online. We hope people get involved with the virtual carnival and enjoy looking back at previous event."
