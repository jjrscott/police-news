We're appealing for information and reminding residents to stay alert as we continue to receive reports catalytic converter thefts in Derbyshire and neighbouring counties.

Reminder around catalytic converter thefts after man disturbs offenders

In the latest incident a man was allegedly assaulted after he approached two people who are thought to have been trying to steal the part from his car in Derby on Wednesday 19 August.

The 39 year old had been at his home on Baseball Drive at around 2pm when he heard a noise and saw his car had been jacked up.

He went outside and noticed two men at the back of his vehicle, and shouted at them. They both stood up and one of the men threatened and hit him with one of their tools, while the other man gathered up their equipment.

They both then got into their vehicle, which drove off in the direction of Cambridge Street.

The victim suffered bruising to his chest.

Detective Inspector Matt Croome said: "We want to reassure residents that our officers are investigating and working hard with other forces and partner agencies to target this type of crime.

"Please remain vigilant to this type of crime. Avoid challenging anyone you think may be committing a crime as you could be putting yourself at risk, but if you notice anyone acting suspiciously around a vehicle then please report it as soon as you can to us.

"Make a note of as much information as you can including descriptions of those involved, and details of any vehicles, including registration numbers, as this information could be really important to our inquiries."

A catalytic converter is a device on vehicle exhausts that reduces the toxic gases and pollutants. Precious metals must be used because the converters have to work efficiently enough to meet emissions standards. They are being stolen because of the value of these precious metals and thefts have been gradually increasing over the year.

There are a number of steps motorists can take to reduce their chance of becoming a victim, including:

 * If possible, park in a garage or in a position where it would be difficult to access the underside of the vehicle near the exhaust
 * Consider marking the catalytic converter with a serial number to identify it, and register it on sites such as Immobilise
 * Consider installing protective coverings over the converter, but seek advice from a professional as different makes offer different types which are safe. This may not prevent it from being stolen, but would make it more difficult and slow down the process
 * Install alarms and CCTV
 * Good quality lighting near to your vehicle will improve natural surveillance and can act as a deterrent
 * If you see anyone acting suspicious/appearing to be working on a car in a public car park, please report it to us

The cars that are most often targeted are hybrid vehicles, as the catalytic converter is used less frequently. The metals they use are less likely to corrode, meaning they are worth more.
