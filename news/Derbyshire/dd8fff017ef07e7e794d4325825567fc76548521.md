Officers are appealing for information after a fatal collision between a pedestrian and a car in Arundel Street, Derby at around 9.30pm on Friday, May 10.

Vilnis Vancans, 35, from Derby was sadly pronounced dead at the scene of the incident following the collision which also involved a grey Mini.

The 26-year-old driver of the Mini was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He has since been released under investigation.

Officers would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision, or anyone with CCTV installed in the area.

Mr Vancans' wife has paid tribute to her husband by dedicating the following poem to him:

_He never thought when leaving home,
He would never more return,
That he in death, so soon would sleep,
And leave us here alone.
He was always there when we needed him,
No task too great or small,
With loving heart and willing hands,
For us he did it all.
We hold him close within our hearts,
And there he shall remain,
To walk with us throughout our lives,
Until we meet again._

Anyone with information which may assist with officers' enquiries is asked to contact us quoting reference number 19*239077 and the name of the officer in the case, Sergeant Scott Riley.
