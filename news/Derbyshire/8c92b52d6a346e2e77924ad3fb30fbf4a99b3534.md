A man arrested on suspicion of murdering two people at a house in Duffield remains in custody this afternoon.

Detectives investigating what happened at the house in New Zealand Lane have said they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths and there was no one else in the property at the time.

Formal identification of the victims has yet to take place and specially trained liaison officers are supporting their families.

We were called to a house in New Zealand Lane at 4.11am today (Wednesday 1 January) and found a man and a woman fatally injured inside.

A 39-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of two counts of murder.
