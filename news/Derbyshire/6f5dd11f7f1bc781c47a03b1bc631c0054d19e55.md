Officers investigating the theft of a car in Shirebrook are appealing for drivers with dashcam footage to come forward to help with enquiries.

The car, a black Nissan Micra, was stolen from a car park off Redbridge Close, Shirebrook, just before 9.30pm on Wednesday 9 December.

The Micra, which had a number plate ending LBJ, was stolen by a man wearing a white hooded top and driven off from the car park with a silver Peugeot following it - also believed to have been involved in the theft.

The area was very busy at the time of the theft and officers believe there may be drivers with dashcam footage who are able to assist with their enquiries.
