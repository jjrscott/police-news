We are appealing for information on the whereabouts of Kacey-Ann Barnes, who has gone missing from her home in Derby.

The 14-year-old was last seen at her home in Mickleover in the early hours of 1 January and snuck out of the house between then and about 6am.

She has not been in contact with family since then and we are growing increasingly concerned for her welfare, particularly with the poor weather.

Do you recognise Kacey-Ann from the photo? Have you seen her since yesterday, or do you know where she is now?

If you can help, contact us now using one of the below methods, quoting incident 463 of 1 January.
