We'd like to remind you of ways in which you can contact the force.

It is now possible for you to get in touch with us in a range of different ways, to report non-emergencies.

If you don't want to speak to someone on the phone, you can send us a message on social media, use our website, or speak to a call handler on Live Chat.

This will then free up our call handlers to answer the phones to those that would prefer to physically speak to someone.

Our team of helpful call handlers are here for the people of Derbyshire 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

The links you can use to get in touch digitally are:

 * Facebook: Send a message to us on facebook.com/derbyshireconstabulary
 * Twitter: Send a direct message to our contact centre via twitter.com/derpolcontact
 * Website: Use our online forms and Live Chat by visiting derbyshire.police.uk

Our website houses a number of online forms, where you can report a crime, road traffic incident, anti-social behaviour, apply for licenses and firearms certificates, as well as use 'Your Area', where residents can find out more about, and contact, their local Safer Neighbourhood Teams.

If you can, please consider contacting us digitally, so our call handlers are free to speak to those that don't have any access to the internet to do so.

Please note, in the case of an emergency, you should always phone 999.
