Two men have been charged and a large amount of drugs and cash recovered from a flat in Derby.

Officers from the Proactive Unit and Safer Neighbourhood team visited a flat in Brookbridge Court, Brook Street, yesterday after receiving intelligence that there may have been drugs inside.

They found a large amount of crack cocaine and heroin inside the flat, along with cash.

Simeon Wild (19), of Brookbridge Court, Brook Street, was charged with possessing heroin and crack cocaine with intent to supply.

Jovan Dontae Smith (19) of Maltravers Way, Sheffield, was charged with being concerned in the supply of both drugs.

They are due to appear before magistrates in Derby today (Thursday, 12 September).
