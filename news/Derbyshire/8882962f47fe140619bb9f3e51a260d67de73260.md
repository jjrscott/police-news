We're appealing for witnesses after a robbery in which an electric scooter was stolen in Ripley.

We were called shortly after 1pm yesterday (24 February) to report that a 26-year-old man had been approached by two men, assaulted and had his scooter stolen in Malthouse Yard, off High Street.

One of the offenders was wearing black jogging bottoms and a black jacket.

The scooter was later recovered in Outram Street.

Officers are keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or who has information that may assist with their enquiries.

Anyone with information can contact DC Stuart Coutin quoting reference number 21*109284.
