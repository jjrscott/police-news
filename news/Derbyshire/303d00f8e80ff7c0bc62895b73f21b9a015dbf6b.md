We are appealing for witnesses after a 25-year-old man was allegedly assaulted in Langley Mill.

It happened at around 8.45pm on Thursday 22 October.

The man was running along Cromford Road, but as he reached the junction of Plumptre Road he started to be followed a short distance until he reached the Cromford Road Industrial Estate, near the junction with Hall Road.

Feeling concerned, the man stopped and waited behind a bush for around 10 mins. As he stepped a man got out of a car and allegedly assaulted him with a bat, causing him to suffer injuries to his head and face and had to attend hospital for treatment.

An investigation is currently ongoing and a 27-year-old man was arrested in connection with the incident. He has been released under investigation while inquiries continue.

Officers would like to speak to anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or who may have dashcam or CCTV footage in the area at that time.
