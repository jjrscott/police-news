Op Relentless

16:39 02/03/2020

We're appealing for anyone with dash cam or CCTV footage to come forward after a car was stolen in Newhall last week.

The red Ford Fiesta ST-2 Turbo was stolen from the driveway of a property in Meadow Lane on Monday 24 February at around 10.20pm.

It is understood that a light-coloured saloon car pulled up nearby and two men got out and approached the Fiesta. The saloon car was then driven off, followed by the Fiesta, in the direction of Oversetts Road.

Officers are keen to receive footage from anyone who was travelling nearby at the time with dash cam installed, or anyone who has CCTV installed locally.

If you have footage that may be useful for officers, please ensure it is securely downloaded to another device and kept safely for them to view.
