We are trying to trace a youth who has allegedly sexually assaulted a 13-year-old girl he has previously harassed.

The latest incident happened at about 8am on Friday 19 March. The girl was walking along Parsons Green, Mackworth, when she was approached by a boy aged about 17, who touched her bottom before running away.

A week earlier, on either Monday 8 March or Tuesday 9 March, the same youth is said to have approached the girl was she walked through Skitteridge Woods and made to grab her but she ran off.

On Wednesday 10 March, the girl was with a friend in the same woods when she saw the youth again. He threatened her and she and her friend ran away.

The youth is described as white, of medium build, wearing a black puffer coat with a hood up and a snood over his mouth.
