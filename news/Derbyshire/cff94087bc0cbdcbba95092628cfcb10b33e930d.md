We have released two images of a man we would like to identify in connection with two incidents at a convenience store in Horse Chestnut Close, Boythorpe.

On Sunday, 14 July, at around 6.20pm, a man entered the store and stole household goods, placing them in a rucksack. When he was challenged by an assistant, he left the store on foot.

On Tuesday, 23 July, at around 9.20pm, a man entered the store, and stole household goods, e-cigarettes and a number of scratchcards. He put the items in a bag and his pockets, and left the store.

The man, pictured, was in the shop on both occasions and may be able to help us with our enquires.
