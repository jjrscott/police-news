Whaley Bridge is being evacuated due to the ongoing situation at Toddbrook Reservoir.

If you are being evacuated then please attend Chapel High School, Long Lane, Chapel-en-le-Frith, High Peak, SK23 0TQ, where further direction will be given.

Police officers and staff will be at the school to provide further direction, though at this time we are not sure how long the evacuation will take.

Residents are asked to make alternative arrangements to stay with friends and family, ensure that any pets are taken with them and that all medication that may be needed for a number of days is taken with them.

If people do not have somewhere to go then they will be accommodated, however, there is limited capacity to do so.

If you are unable to leave your own home and require assistance please contact 101 and ask for the police.
