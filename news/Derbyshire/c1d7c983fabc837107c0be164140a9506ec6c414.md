Officers investigating the theft of a car from a driveway in Bernard Gadsby Close, Ashbourne are asking the public for their help.

The theft is reported to have happened between 10.30pm on Friday, May 24 and 8am on Saturday, May 25.

The owner of the car, a grey Audi A5, is still in possession of the keys.

PC Lisa Knight, investigating the theft, said: "We are keen to hear from anyone who lives nearby who witnessed anything suspicious, or has CCTV or dash cam footage which may show the vehicle.

Anyone with footage that may be useful is asked to download it to a storage device for officers to view.

PC Knight continued: "Following this incident, we would remind anyone with a keyless car to store their keys inside a metal container or a signal-blocking wallet overnight, or invest in an immobiliser such as a steering lock to secure against this type of theft."
