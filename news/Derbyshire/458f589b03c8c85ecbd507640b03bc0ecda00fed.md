This week we are supporting International Control Room Week, celebrating the hard work and dedication of our call handlers and CMARC staff.

In the Contact Management and Resolution Centre, call handlers are responsible for dispatching officers to incidents, answering 999 and non-emergency 101 calls, as well as replying to messages that come in to us digitally on Facebook and Twitter.

As part of the awareness week, staff have been given boxes of chocolates to enjoy, as well as balloons, bunting and stickers to decorate the control room with.

Superintendent Adrian Gascoyne, who is the Head of CMARC, said: "Our staff are dedicated, hardworking people that can face some real challenges in their day to day duties. Some of the calls they take can be quite distressing, but they remain professional and committed to providing a quality service to the residents of Derbyshire that need our help, and are there to support one another once they hang up the phone.

"The work they do really is invaluable and we are so lucky to have such a great team as part of our force."

In this short video, CMARC officers Becky Robinson and Lynne Hallam tell us a bit about why they do what they do and what a typical shift looks like for them.

The control room is at the heart of every call for service, so with that in mind please join us in thanking them for their hard work.
