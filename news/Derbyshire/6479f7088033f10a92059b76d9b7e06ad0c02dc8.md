This week saw 20 officers complete their initial training as they were all sworn in at an attestation evening.

Families and friends gathered at police headquarters in Ripley on Thursday, June 27 to watch the new officers as they were welcomed into the policing family.

The officers have been in training school since March and will now be posted across the county including Buxton, Swadlincote, Killamarsh, Ilkeston, Matlock, Ripley and Derby.

These recruits are part of the growth in police numbers in Derbyshire pledged by the Police and Crime Commissioner when he set the budget for 2019/20, with more new officers currently in training to follow them over the next couple of months.

Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Swann said: "Being a police officer is a diverse and challenging job, but it is extremely rewarding and you get to make a difference to so many people's lives, which I think is what attracts people like these of all backgrounds to the role. Their attestation is a day they'll remember for the rest of their lives."
