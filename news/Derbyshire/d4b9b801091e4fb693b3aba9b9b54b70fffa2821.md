A murder investigation has been launched following the disappearance of Chesterfield man Graham Snell.

Following a call reporting Mr Snell missing on June 30 officers began making enquiries in and around the Chesterfield area. Mr Snell was last seen alive on Wednesday, June 19, in Chesterfield town centre.

Information that came to light during these enquiries has changed the investigation from one of a missing person to one of murder.

A 29-year-old man, from Chesterfield has been arrested on suspicion of murder, and is currently in police custody.

A second man, a 31 year-old, from Chesterfield, has been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.

Over the past three days officers have been focusing their enquiries in, and around, Mr Snell's home in Marsden Street, close to Chesterfield town centre.

Today those searches have continued in Marsden Street and the surrounding area and local residents are likely to see an increased police presence in the coming days.

Officers have also be conducting enquiries in Oakamoor Close and residents will have seen an increased police presence in the area.

Detectives are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen anything suspicious or out of the ordinary in those areas between Wednesday, June 19 and Sunday, June 30.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact Derbyshire police immediately on the 101 number or anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 with reference 19*340439.
