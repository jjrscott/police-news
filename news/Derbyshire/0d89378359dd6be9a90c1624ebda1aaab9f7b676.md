At around 10am on Sunday, 26 January a man's body was found in an allotment off Prospect Drive.

We arrived at the scene to find a man deceased. A post-mortem examination of the body took place this afternoon.

The man suffered injuries that would suggest that he had been assaulted. A formal identification has not yet taken place and enquiries are ongoing to identify the man's family.
