Officers are appealing for help to trace the two men pictured in connection with a stabbing in a Buxton street.

The force was called to reports that a man had been injured in Elizabeth Avenue, Fairfield, Buxton, at around 12.40pm on Monday 30 November.

A 20-year-old man was found with serious injuries after he was assaulted in the street and he continues to recover from his injuries.

The two men pictured were seen in the area at the time of the incident and officers are keen to speak to them - or hear from anyone who recognises them.

While the pictures are not of a high quality it is hoped that the images, coupled with the description of the clothing worn, will help with their identification.

Man 1 - wearing a navy jacket, light jogging bottoms and white trainers

Man 2 - wearing a navy jacket with a fur-lined hood, navy bottoms with a light stripe down the side of each leg and dark footwear with horizontal white around the edge of the soles.

Officers also want to speak to a third man who witnessed the assault and was wearing a blue jacket and light-coloured jogging bottoms with a patch on the left leg.
