A 29-year-old man from Derby has appeared at court charged with a number of alleged offences in Boyer Street, Derby.

At 3.30pm on Monday, May 6, we were called to reports that a man had allegedly assaulted two people close to the Sainsbury's at the junction of Boyer Street and Farm Street.

Armed officers, who were on patrol nearby, were first on the scene and arrested Jamie Austin on suspicion of assault.

The two victims were taken to hospital with injuries caused by a knife and both are now recovering at home.

Today the 29-year-old, of Warner Street, Derby, was charged with two counts of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm, one count of affray, one count of possession of an offensive weapon and one count of criminal damage.

He appeared at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court today where he was remanded in custody.
