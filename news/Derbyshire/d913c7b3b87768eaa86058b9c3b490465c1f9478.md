Officers searching for missing Matlock man Joshua Jones are appealing for anyone who may have picked up a hitchhiker on the A632 yesterday (12 December) in the direction of Chesterfield to contact the force.

Joshua was last seen in the Hurst Rise area of Matlock at 11.30am yesterday (12 December) wearing a pair of blue jeans, a grey Superdry coat which is darker on the sleeves with a hood that is green on the inside.

Numerous sightings have been received of a man matching the description of Joshua on the A632 heading towards Chesterfield at around 4pm. It is believed the man was trying to hitch a lift and officers are keen to speak to anyone who may have picked up a hitchhiker on that road yesterday.

Equally, officers are keen to speak to anyone who may have been hitchhiking in that area yesterday, in order to narrow down whether the man seen is Joshua.
