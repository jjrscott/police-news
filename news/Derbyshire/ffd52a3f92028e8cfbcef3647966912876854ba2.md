A car thief has been jailed after stealing a high value BMW from a takeaway in Buxton.

Conan McLean entered the takeaway in Bridge Street on 28 February, 2020, and stole the keys to the BMW i8 sports car - along with £15 in cash.

The vehicle was reported stolen and was soon stopped in Nelson, Lancashire by police with McLean behind the wheel.

The 57-year-old denied stealing the car but was found guilty at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court of the theft of the BMW along with driving without insurance and the theft of the money.

McLean, of Alma Street, Buxton, was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison, banned from driving for six months and ordered to pay £200 in compensation.
