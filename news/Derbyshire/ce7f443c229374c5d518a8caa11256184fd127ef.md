Two people have died at a house in Duffield and a double murder investigation has been launched.

We were called to a house in New Zealand Lane at 4.11am today (Wednesday 1 January) and found a man and a woman fatally injured inside.

A man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of two counts of murder.

He remains in custody at this time.

New Zealand Lane remains closed and we would like to thank residents for their patience and understanding that the closure is necessary while we investigate what happened.
