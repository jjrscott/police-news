Celebrating bonfire night this weekend?

Derbyshire Fire & Rescue Service have released some safety advice if you are handling fireworks and hosting an event at home.

They are:

ðŸŽ† Don't set off fireworks between 11pm-7am.

ðŸŽ† Keep fireworks in a closed metal box and take them out one at a time

ðŸŽ† Follow the manufacturer's instructions on each firework. Read them by torch light, not a naked flame, always buy fireworks from a reputable source

ðŸŽ† Light fireworks at arm's length using a safety firework lighter or fuse wick - then stand back

ðŸŽ† NEVER go back to a firework once lit, it may still go off

ðŸŽ† Collect used fireworks with care, douse with water and bury them or place in a metal container

ðŸŽ† Keep children away from fireworks and bonfires

ðŸŽ† Keep pets indoors

ðŸŽ† Take care with sparklers - young children should not handle these

ðŸŽ† NEVER throw fireworks

ðŸŽ† NEVER keep fireworks in your pocket

ðŸŽ† Keep a bucket of water handy.

Be sensible, be safe, and enjoy the celebrations responsibly.
