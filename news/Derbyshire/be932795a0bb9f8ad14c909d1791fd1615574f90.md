A 23-year-old man has been charged and remanded in prison on suspicion of numerous drug and driving offences.

The first incident involving Gary Briggs was a warrant at an address in Lincoln Way, Midway, Swadlincote, on 16 September where a quantity of cannabis was located and he was subsequently charged with being concerned in the supply of a class B drug and possession with intent to supply a class B drug.

The second incident took place the following day in Chatsworth Road, Newhall, where it is alleged that he was driving whilst disqualified and driving without insurance.

The third incident allegedly saw Gary Briggs, of no fixed abode, fail to stop the vehicle he was allegedly driving at the time, a black VW Golf, in Hepworth Road, Swadlincote, at around 1.30am on 5 October.

The car was unable to be stopped by officers at the time, however, following his arrest on 7 October he was charged with dangerous driving, taking a motor vehicle without the owner's permission and driving without insurance - along with the offences for the above two incidents.

The final incident, which saw Gary Briggs charged with driving whilst disqualified and driving without insurance, took place on 7 October. A PCSO allegedly witnessed Gary Briggs riding a Yamaha R6 at Willington Services and he was arrested at a nearby hotel.

On 8 October he was charged with all the offences mentioned above and remanded in police custody. He appeared at South Derbyshire Magistrates' Court the following day, where he was remanded to prison.
