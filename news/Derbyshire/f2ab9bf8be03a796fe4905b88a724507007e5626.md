We're appealing for witnesses after a burglary in Derby, in which a mobile phone was stolen.

At around 7.30am on Saturday 29 August a man knocked on the door of a house in Rutland Street, Pear Tree and asked to use the toilet. Once inside the property he stole a Samsung mobile phone.

Officers investigating the incident are now appealing for witnesses who may have information that can help with their enquiries.

The burglar is described as black and was wearing a blue tracksuit. He spoke with a West Midlands accent.
