We've released images of two women we'd like to speak with about a purse theft in Chesterfield on Friday, 23 August.

A bank card from the purse was then used in an attempted cash withdrawal at an ATM in another shop.

Officers believe that the two women shown in these images may be able to assist with their enquiries.
