A 46-year-old man has appeared at court charged with burglary and damaging property at the Royal Derby Hospital.

The incident occurred overnight between Monday 4 May and Tuesday 5 May inside the Kings Treatment Centre. A laptop was allegedly stolen and significant amount of damage was caused.

Peter Boumphrey, of St Chads Road, Derby, was charged with one count of burglary and one count of causing damage to property on Monday 13 July and was remanded into police custody.

He appeared yesterday (14 July) at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court where he pleaded not guilty to the offences and was released on conditional bail while a trial date is set.
