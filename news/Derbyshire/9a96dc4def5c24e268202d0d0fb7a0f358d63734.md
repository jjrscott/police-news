Our Christmas 'Don't Get Wrecked' drink and drug drive campaign started on Tuesday 1 December 2020.

In just two weeks, our Roads Policing Unit have already conducted 115 breath tests and 42 drug swipes - recording 39 positive drink or drug related driving offences.

Six drivers under the age of 25 and thirteen over 25, have tested positive for having cannabis or cocaine in their systems whilst on our roads. These were predominantly drivers of cars, however, one individual was found to be intoxicated whilst driving a HGV and another riding a motorcycle. Four of these offences caused road traffic collisions.

20 drivers have tested positive for being over the drink drive limit, three of which were drivers under the age of 25 and seventeen over 25. The alcohol limit for drivers is 35 micrograms per 100 millilitres of breath, the highest recorded readings ranged between 93-105. Their selfish actions, whilst behind the wheel, have led to seven collisions taking place.

Our officers will continue their hard work in tackling drink and drug driving offences throughout the festive season, making the roads of Derbyshire a safer place for all.
