A man has been charged in connection with an incident in Renishaw where two teenagers suffered stab wounds.

Adam Wildman, of Carrwood Road, Renishaw, has been charged with wounding and affray. The 19-year-old appeared at court this morning (Friday 12 February) where he was remanded into custody.

The charges relate to an incident which happened around 7 pm on Monday 8 February, near to the Miners' Welfare on Main Road.

Three boys, two aged 15 and another aged 14, were assaulted. The two 15-year-olds received stab wounds, while the 14-year-old was hit to the head.

None of the injuries to the boys, who are all from the Sheffield area, are believed to be life-threatening, and they were taken to Sheffield Children's Hospital for treatment.

A 35-year-old man and 18-year-old man, both from Renishaw, were arrested yesterday, Thursday 11 February on suspicion of affray and wounding. They have both been released on police bail.

It brings the total number of people arrested in connection with this incident to five, as two boys, a 17-year-old from Renishaw and a 15-year-old from Sheffield, were arrested earlier this week on suspicion of affray and wounding. They have also been released on police bail.

An investigation is still ongoing and our officers are keen to speak to any witnesses or anyone with CCTV in the area who hasn't yet come forward.

They would also like to hear from anyone who may have noticed any suspicious activity around the Renishaw area since the time of the incident.
