We are trying to trace the owner of a bicycle which was stolen in Chesterfield and later recovered by officers.

At around 6.20pm on Tuesday 4 February, two teenagers were allegedly seen acting suspiciously around a bike which was had been left locked to the bike racks in Low Pavement, outside McDonalds.

The bike was taken and officers later recovered it nearby. A 13-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy have been spoken to and the bike seized.
