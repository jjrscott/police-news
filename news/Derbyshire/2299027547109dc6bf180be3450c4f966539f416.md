A cyclist has suffered serious injuries following a collision near Chesterfield and we are trying to trace a van we believe was involved.

Shortly after 8am today (Sunday 26 July) a cyclist and a van collided at the Whitmoor Roundabout.

The van, which witnesses say is small and either grey or silver, did not stop at the scene. It is thought the van drove off along the A61 towards Sheffield.

The island remains closed and is expected to be shut for some time while we investigate what happened. We are advising drivers to avoid the area.
