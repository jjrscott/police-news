A 36-year-old-man from Chesterfield has been arrested following reports of a disturbance at a house in Outram Road at 1.05am this morning.

On attendance officers were deployed to a property in Chantrey Avenue and due to concerns for the safety of a man there, they used a 'flash bang' distraction device to allow them to enter.

The man was detained without injury and arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, threats to commit criminal damage and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He remains in custody.
