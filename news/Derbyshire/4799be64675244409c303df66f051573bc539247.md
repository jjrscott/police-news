If you have had to abandon your vehicle due to flooding, please recover it as soon as it is safe to do so.

Firstly check the Derbyshire County Council or Derby City Council websites to make sure the road where you left your vehicle is no longer closed.

While it is important that abandoned vehicles are recovered as soon as possible so they do not obstruct the highway, please make sure it is safe to return to your vehicle and do not put yourself in any danger.
