A large amount of cash has been recovered during four warrants at houses in Mackworth.

Officers visited houses in the area on Tuesday 4 August and recovered almost Â£41,000 cash.

A 24-year-old man and 51-year-old woman were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of class B drugs and money laundering.

They have been released under investigation while inquiries continue.

A 25-year-old woman attended a police station on Thursday 7 August and was voluntarily interviewed on suspicion of committing the same crimes.
