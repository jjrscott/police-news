We're appealing for information after a 20-year-old man was seriously assaulted in Glossop in the early hours of Saturday morning.

At around 1am on the 18 July the man was walking down Ellison Street, near to the police station, with his girlfriend when they were followed by a large group of youths.

The man was knocked to the ground and punched and kicked by between five and seven members of the group.

He managed to run away but sustained serious injuries during the assault, including a broken right arm and a fractured left arm.

Descriptions of three members of the group, who were all male, have been given as follows:

 * White, 5ft 11ins tall and of slim build with brown hair and a small moustache, aged around 17
 * Mixed race, 6ft tall and of medium build, also aged around 17
 * Another one of the youths is described as wearing only boxer shorts.

If you witnessed this incident, have private CCTV installed in the area or were driving nearby with dash cam installed, please contact Detective Constable Claire Somek quoting reference number 2*369068.

Any footage which may be of use to officers should be downloaded to a separate, secure device ready for them to view.
