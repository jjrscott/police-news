We're appealing for witnesses after a burglary at a house in Long Eaton yesterday evening (Wednesday 3 June).

The incident happened sometime between 8.30pm and 9.15pm at an address in Rydal Avenue.

It is understood that the burglar entered the house while the owner was upstairs inside. The back door to the property had been forced open.

A wallet was stolen during the incident which contained a bank card and a quantity of cash.

Anyone who was in the area at the time and noticed anything suspicious, or anyone who may have video footage that could assist officers with their enquiries - be that dash cam footage or private CCTV footage - is asked to contact us.

Please quote reference number 2*282039 and the name of the officer in the case PC Max Malster, in any correspondence.

Any video footage should be downloaded to a separate, secure device ready for officers to view.
