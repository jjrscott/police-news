We were called to reports of a fire on land behind the Kissing Gate Leisure Centre in Shirebrook earlier this afternoon.

Sadly the body of a man was found at the scene of the fire.

An investigation into the circumstances has since been launched and people in the area will have seen a large police presence throughout the day and into this evening.

We would like to reassure the community that we believe this to be an isolated incident. Although we know the nature of the incident will be distressing for the people of Shirebrook, we do not believe there is any reason for people to be further alarmed.

The incident happened at about 1.10pm and we would still like to hear from anyone who was in the leisure centre area between 12.30pm and 1.15pm.

Anyone who has information should get in touch with us as soon as possible, using one of the below methods and quoting reference 454 of 27 January:
