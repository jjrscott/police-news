A lorry driver who killed a keen young cyclist has been jailed for more than three years.

Josephine Gilbert was just 25-years-old when Herbert Wyatt's HGV struck her as she cycled near Markeaton Island, Derby, on Tuesday 21 January.

Miss Gilbert, who was from Wirksworth but was living in Derby at the time, died instantly.

At Derby Crown Court today, Wyatt was sentenced to three years and nine months in prison and was disqualified from driving for five years and three months.

Wyatt, whose licence to drive lorries had been revoked 12 weeks before the fatal collision, kept that from his employer and was therefore also uninsured at the time.

Officer in the case DC Richard Marshall said: "This was an investigation into the tragic, unnecessary death of a young lady - aged just 25-years-old - who had the whole of her life to look forward too.

"Josephine had set off that day on her road bike, doing what she enjoyed, one of her big passions in her life. Not only was Josephine's death totally avoidable, the driver of the lorry should not have been on the road, having had his licence revoked.

"No sentence any court in the land can pass is able to compensate the loss to her family and friends. This is an investigation which captured the hearts of many within the team, some of whom are keen cyclists.

"Our thoughts at this difficult time are very much with Josephine's family."

Wyatt, 65, of Telford Way, Thurnby, Leicester, pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving, as well causing death by driving a vehicle while uninsured and causing death by dangerous driving while unlicensed.
