Ahead of Valentines Day, we are hosting another live chat where people can come and talk to us about their concerns.

On a day where there will be a lot of romance with partners, there will also be people living in fear of them.

Those people are not alone.

For this reason, tomorrow evening we will be online between the hours of 4-6pm.

If you're worried about a friend, family member, colleague, or even yourself, come and ask us anything. We can help with any questions you might have about domestic abuse, coercive and controlling behaviour, manipulation or anything else.

To make the session more personal, we'd like to introduce the team behind the live chats, so you know who you are talking to should you join us tomorrow.

Pictured from left to right:

**Sergeant Andrew Bott:** "Andrew works in our Investigation Hub in Derby. He has 25 years of police experience, including CID, Custody, being a Temporary Inspector and completing a secondment to Children's Services within Derbyshire County Council. He has experience of multi-agency work in relation to domestic abuse matters and is a Domestic Abuse Champion within the Constabulary."

**Service Manager at the Elm Foundation Chelsea Whiteman:** "Chelsea is a qualified social worker who has worked for The Elm Foundation for over 10 years. She first started at the Elm foundation as a student social worker. In her current role, she manages four refuges as well as the foundation's children and young people's team, who work with young people who have been affected by domestic abuse in their families, as well as with young people who are showing harmful behaviour as a result of what they have witnessed."

**Inspector Beth Lee:** "Beth started her career with the police in 2008 as is now one of the DI's for Public Protection, a department which investigates domestic abuse, rape and child abuse; a role which she is incredibly passionate about. She is from a family of public service workers who taught her a great deal about perspective, empathy and how everybody has a back story - that is something she tries to carry with her every day when doing her job."

**Investigative Support Manager Andy Stokes:** "Andy has been with Derbyshire Constabulary for 36 years now, and retired as a police officer in 2016. During this time he worked with victims of domestic abuse and has seen first-hand the impact that it can have on individuals and families. He now works as a civilian employee with the police, supporting colleagues who are dealing with the impact of domestic abuse every day."
