We have teamed up with partners across Derbyshire to deliver a message worth repeating: stay at home, protect the NHS, and save lives.

We're releasing this short video together ahead of the predicted warmer weather this weekend, and the Easter weekend that follows.

It is our duty to try and limit the spread of coronavirus but we know that with sunnier skies comes the temptation to go out and get together with family and friends.

But it is critically important that we all continue to abide by the ongoing restrictions on movement and the rules on social distancing.

Everyone featured in this video plays a role in society that means they don't have the luxury of staying at home. They all head out to work every day to keep our society moving.

So please watch the short clip and remember that we are all in this together. We need to protect the NHS, and by staying at home and heading out only locally, we can all play our part in saving lives.

This video has been created by a team including Derbyshire Constabulary, Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service, Derbyshire County Council, Derby City Council, Derby Mountain Rescue Team, the Peak District National Park Authority, High Peak Borough Council, South Derbyshire District Council, Derbyshire Dales District Council, Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton, and the Central England Co-op.
