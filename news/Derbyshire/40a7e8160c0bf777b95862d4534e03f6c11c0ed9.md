Officers in Duckmanton, Chesterfield are asking for the public's help in identifying those responsible for a van break.

The image they have released shows both a person and a vehicle they wish to identify.

The van was parked in Markham Road on Friday, May 10, and the incident is believed to have happened overnight between then and Saturday, May 11.

The car, shown in the background to this image, was used by the offender to arrive and leave the scene. CCTV shows the car pull up, a person get out and force open the locked back door of the van.

The door was damaged in the incident, however nothing was stolen as the van was empty.

If you live in the local area, could you have either CCTV or dash cam footage that shows a similar vehicle acting suspiciously? Do you recognise the person pictured?
