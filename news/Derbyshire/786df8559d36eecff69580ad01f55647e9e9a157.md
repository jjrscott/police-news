A motorcyclist died following a collision in the Peak District.

We were called to the B6012 at Beeley at 5.20pm on Sunday 26 July following reports of a collision involving a motorbike and a Toyota Rav 4.

The motorcycle rider, a woman in her 40s, died at the scene.

A 27-year-old Matlock man has been arrested on suspicion of drug-driving.

The road was closed between Pilsley and Rowsley while we carried out investigative work and it re-opened just after 11pm.

Any witnesses, or anyone with information, should contact us quoting reference 992 of July 26.
