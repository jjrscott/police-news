We're appealing for information after more than 70 sheep were stolen from farmland near to Bamford.

Officers on the Derbyshire Rural Crime Team are investigating after 27 ewes and 46 lambs were stolen from land at Shatton village between Tuesday 1 September and Thursday 3 September.

PC Paul Gamble of the Derbyshire Rural Crime Team said: "This type of crime does carry a significant financial loss to the farmer but it can also cause some concern around not knowing what has happened to the animals, and the time and effort it takes to establish a flock.

"While it is quite a remote area, we would like to hear from anyone who may have noticed any suspicious vehicles or activity during that time or who may have information around the illegal trade in livestock."

PC Gamble added: "Please do get in touch if you have any information, no matter how small, as even if it turns out the individuals are legitimate, we would rather be made aware so we can check all is well."
