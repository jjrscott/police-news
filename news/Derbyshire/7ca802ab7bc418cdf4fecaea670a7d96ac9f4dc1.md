Two men have been arrested after a man was found unconscious in a Ripley street in the early hours of Sunday morning (27 October).

Officers were called just after 5am to report that a man had been attacked and was unconscious near to Wilko. East Midlands Ambulance Service also attended and a 21-year-old man was taken to Kingsmill hospital for treatment where he remains in a critical condition.

It is understood that the man may have been in the Association and Crib bars prior to the incident.

A 27-year old man from Ilkeston was arrested on suspicion of actual bodily harm (ABH) yesterday (27 October) and has since been released on police bail. A 48-year-old man from Alfreton was also arrested this morning (October 28) on suspicion of grievous bodily harm (GBH) and remains in police custody.

Officers' enquiries into the incident continue and we're keen to hear from anyone with information about the incident, who has not already contacted us.

We'd especially like to hear from anyone who has CCTV installed in the area, or anyone who was driving nearby and has dash cam installed.

Any footage that may be of use to officers should be downloaded onto another device and safely kept for officers to view.
