From today three further areas of Derbyshire have been classified as Tier 2 or high alert under the Government's new local COVID alert system, due to an increase in the number of Coronavirus infections in these areas.

The complete list of areas now on high alert within Derbyshire is as follows:

 * Chesterfield
 * Erewash
 * High Peak (Glossop area)
 * North East Derbyshire

These areas are subject to some additional restrictions, as well as the national ones which are currently in place.

The rest of the county currently remains at Tier 1 or medium alert.

Please ensure you are familiar with the restrictions within your local area by visiting the Government website, where you will find further information and a post code checker so that you understand how the new system will affect you, your friends and family specifically.

We understand that this is a worrying and frustrating time for everybody and would again like to reiterate our thanks to the vast majority of Derbyshire residents who continue to follow the rules, in collaborative effort to slow the spread of the virus and keep each other safe.
