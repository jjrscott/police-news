** ** Detectives leading a murder inquiry into the death of Andrew Jackson are reappealing for information, six months after he was found dead in Shirebrook.

The body of Mr Jackson who was 55-years-old, was discovered at around 10am on Sunday 26 January at an allotment, off Prospect Drive.

Since the murder investigation was launched in January this year, nine people have been arrested in connection with the incident.

Detective Inspector Chris Marriott, who is leading the investigation said:

"Today marks the six month anniversary of Andrew's death and we have released a video to reappeal for information about the circumstances which led to this.

"The video shows the area in which Andrew was found, and it is our hope that this may jog the publics' memory about anything suspicious which they noticed happening nearby in the hours leading up to his death.

"A dedicated team continue to work on this case and I would urge anyone with information, no matter how insignificant it seems, to contact us so that we can investigate and look to provide some closure for Andrew's family."

Crimestoppers are offering a Â£10,000 reward to anyone who provides information which leads to a successful conviction.
