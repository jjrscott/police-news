With the ongoing response to coronavirus in the UK you may have seen a change in the way our officers are working.

In line with the current Government advice (as of 18.03.20) we have stopped a small amount of engagement activity - such as visiting schools or events like Cuppa With A Copper -to help combat the spread of the coronavirus.

This does not mean that there is a reduced service - in fact it is very much the opposite. Officers are out on patrol and the force is ensuring resilience over the coming weeks and months to keep residents, businesses and visitors safe.

You may find that there is a longer than usual wait for your 101 call to be answered. If possible you should report your crime via www.derbyshire.police.uk \- or report your crime or incident via direct message on Twitter via @DerPolContact or by private message on the main force Facebook page.

If you are concerned about crime then you can still speak to officers or you can of course contact us on social media or by using the online contact form on our website.

It is also important to make sure you are following the NHS and Public Health England for all the latest health guidance and ensure you are only sharing information from trusted sources.
