We're appealing for witnesses after a collision between two cars in Derby earlier today.

We were called to reports of a collision between a blue Ford Fiesta and a Grey Mitsubishi Lancer in Greenwich Drive South, Mackworth shortly before 11.55am today.

A young boy who was a passenger in the Fiesta was taken to hospital for treatment, where he remains. His injuries are described as not life threatening or life changing.

A 17-year-old boy, the driver of the Mitsubishi has been arrested in connection with the incident.

We'd like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident, anyone driving nearby at the time with dash cam installed which may have captured the incident, or anyone who has private CCTV installed at a property nearby.

If you have footage which may be of use to officers please ensure it downloaded to a separate, secure device ready for us to review.

Please quote reference number 2*273526 in any correspondence.
