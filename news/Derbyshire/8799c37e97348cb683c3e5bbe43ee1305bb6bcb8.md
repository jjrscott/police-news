Three men have been arrested as part of an investigation into the theft of vehicles in north east Derbyshire.

Officers are investigating a series of thefts from areas including Hollingwood and Dronfield.

They followed a van in Barlborough late last night (Sunday 29 December) and stopped it after a short pursuit, arresting the 18-year-old driver on suspicion of dangerous driving, stealing the van and failing to stop for police.

A short time later, officers saw a Land Rover Defender driving along the M1 which they believed to have been stolen. They stopped it and the driver, a 39-year-old man, was arrested on suspicion of stealing the Land Rover, failing to stop and criminal damage to two police cars.

Officers from South Yorkshire Police then stopped a Volkswagen Passat in Bawtry at our request and arrested the 39-year-old driver on suspicion of conspiracy to steal vehicles.

The three men remain in custody and are being questioned.
