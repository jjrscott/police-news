A man has died following a fire in a shed in Derby.

Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service were initially called to reports of a shed fire in Hutton Street, Allenton, at 11.30pm on Saturday, 18 January.

At the scene a 37-year-old man was found with severe burns and was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham. He passed away yesterday morning. Our thoughts are with his family and friends and specialist officers are supporting his immediate family.

Over the course of Sunday and into today a joint police and fire investigation has been ongoing to establish the cause of the fire and residents are likely to see a presence at the property for the rest of today.
