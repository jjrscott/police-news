We're appealing for information after receiving a report that racist graffiti had appeared in Peet Street, Derby.

The incident is believed to have happened in the early hours of this morning (Friday 21 August) and was reported to us shortly before 7.20am today.

On August 10, similar racist graffiti was found in Peet Street, Stuart Street and Cathedral Green.

Detective Sergeant Jim Shinfield, from Derbyshire's prevent team said:

"An investigation into these incidents of criminal damage is underway and I would like to make it clear that racist graffiti of any kind will not be tolerated by Derbyshire police.

"This type of graffiti does not reflect the views of the vast majority of our communities, and I would urge anyone with information about these incidents to report it to us quoting reference number 2*435725 and the name of the officer in the case PC Sam Sanders.

"If you have further concerns about incidents of hate crime, or that someone you know is expressing extremist views you can contact our prevent team in confidence via one of the following methods."
