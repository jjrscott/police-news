A man who stabbed a member of the public shortly after breaking into a Gurdwara has been jailed for ten-and-a-half years.

Mohammed Ibrar admitted grievous bodily harm and aggravated burglary and was sentenced at Derby Crown Court today.

The 32-year-old, of Cromwell Road, Derby, broke into the Guru Arjan Dev Sikh Gurdwara in Stanhope Street at about 8.30am on May 25 last year, smashing the front doors with a brick.

He then went to the Polancia shop in Normanton Road and a stabbed a man. The victim was taken to hospital where he was treated for injuries to his arm, head and chest.

Chief Superintendent Dave Cox said: "Ibrar's actions that day not only had terrible consequences for the innocent man who was stabbed but he also caused deep upset within the Sikh community.

"We conducted a comprehensive investigation to find Ibrar's motivation for what he did that day and presented our evidence to the CPS for a charging decision.

"I hope this sentencing allows everyone effected by Ibrar's actions to find a degree of closure."
