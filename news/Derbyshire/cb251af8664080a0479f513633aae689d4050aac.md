Witnesses are being sought following an allegation that one motorist punched another in Belper.

A 53-year-old man contacted us to report that at around 9am on Friday, 6 September, he was driving his truck down Bargate Road as a silver BMW 5 series approached in the opposite direction.

The drivers got into an altercation about speed and the BMW driver is alleged to have followed the truck along Gibfield Lane, stopped at the junction with the A6, and punched the truck driver in the face, smashing his glasses.

The area was busy at the time and there could be witnesses who have yet to come forward.

A 26-year-old man has been voluntarily interviewed.

Witnesses or anyone with information should contact officer in the case, PC Julie Pearson, quoting reference 19000475182.
