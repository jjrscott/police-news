We're appealing for witnesses after two boys were injured after being knocked off their bikes in Derby.

One of the boys, who were both 15-years-old, suffered a broken leg and bruising to his head, while the other suffered cuts and bruising to his hand and leg.

It happened at around 7.30pm on Friday 25 September on Infinity Park Way. A white Mercedes, travelling towards Sinfin, allegedly collided with the bikes while trying to overtake another vehicle near the entrance to the science park.

The driver initially stopped to pick up some debris but then drove off towards Sinfin.
