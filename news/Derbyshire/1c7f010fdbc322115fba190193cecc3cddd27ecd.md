We're urging people to be wary after we have received a number of reports of scam calls in which the caller claims he has carried out building work at a person's house and demands money.

We have currently received such reports from the Chaddesden, Spondon and Mickleover areas of Derby but are aware that others may have received such calls.

The caller appears to be targeting elderly and vulnerable people and is reported to be aggressive and threatening if a person refuses to pay any money.

If you have elderly relatives or neighbours, please make them aware of this type of call.

If you, or someone you know has received this type of call, please report it to us as soon as possible and, if you can, make a copy of the number calling you.

Please quote reference number 886 of 9 October in any correspondence.
