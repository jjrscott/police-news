Tomorrow evening, we are all invited to join a Clap for Carers to mark the anniversary of the NHS.

At 5pm on Sunday 5 July, please join the nation from your doorsteps to celebrate 72 years of the service, and to once again thank these key workers for the incredible effort they have made during the Coronavirus pandemic.

Officers will join the clap from Derby Royal Hospital, standing with our emergency service colleagues to reflect on the things our communities have recently endured, stand in solidarity to mourn our losses, and thank those who are risking so much to keep us safe.

The clap is intended to become a yearly show of support for the NHS - time where we can reflect on what we've all been through and how the nurses, doctors, cleaners, carers, support staff and other members of this proud institution who have given up so much, even their lives, to fight Covid19.

Over the last 15 weeks, life hasn't been easy. So please join us in a one-off clap - the loudest ever - to say thank you to those in the NHS who have tirelessly helped us through this crisis.
