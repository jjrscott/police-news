We're appealing for information after a mobility scooter was stolen from an address in Ripley.

The scooter was taken from outside an address in Cedar Avenue sometime between 12 and 13 January.

It was later found abandoned and damaged in a wooded area close to Ripley Academy, Peasehill.

Officers have released an image of the abandoned scooter in a bid to jog the memory of anyone who may have noticed it in the area, around this time or shortly after.

Did you see anyone behaving suspiciously, or notice that something was amiss?

If so, please contact PC Jay Shaw quoting reference number 21*36151.
