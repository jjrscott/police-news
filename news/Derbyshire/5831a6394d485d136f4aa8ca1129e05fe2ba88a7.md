We're appealing for information about the theft of a motorbike in Glossop.

Appeal to trace motorbike which was stolen in Glossop

The bike pictured was stolen from a driveway on Larch Way just after 3pm on Tuesday 20 October.

Its owner had just parked and got off two men riding when a second bike, an orange KTM motorcycle, rode up.

One of the men jumped off the KTM and onto the bike and then rides off, despite the owner trying to stop them.

The bike has since been seen in the Marple area and we would like to hear from anyone with any information about its whereabouts.
