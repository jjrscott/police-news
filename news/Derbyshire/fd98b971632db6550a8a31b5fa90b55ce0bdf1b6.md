We're appealing for witnesses after a break-in at a house in Chesterfield.

Shortly after 4pm on Tuesday 25 February, three men knocked at the door of a house in Sheffield Road.

As the owner went to answer the door the men proceeded to smash open a glass panel within it and forced their way into the property.

The owners chased the men away and they ran out of the door before getting into a silver coloured car.

The men are described as white, around 18-years-old and were all wearing dark coloured clothing including hoodies, with the hoods pulled up. Each of the men had their faces partially covered.
