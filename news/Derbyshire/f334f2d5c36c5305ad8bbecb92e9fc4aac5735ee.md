Officers investigating a robbery in Derby are appalling for help identifying the person pictured.

Two 15-year-old boys told officers that they were approached by a group of teenagers who threatened them, punched one of them to the face and then took their mobile phones and money.

Officers want to speak to the person pictured and want to hear from anyone who believes they know who they are.

Since the incident, which took place at around 5pm on Friday 23 October, a number of lines of enquiry have been followed by officers and a 16-year-old boy from Derby has been arrested and released under investigation in connection with the incident.
