The public in Derbyshire can now submit dash cam or digital footage of road traffic incidents via the Derbyshire police website.

A new system called Derbyshire Capture has been introduced which will enable members of the public to securely upload footage.

Assistant Chief Constable Kem Mehmet said: "This new system will provide a quick and easy way for the public to submit footage to us.

"So many drivers and road users now have dash cams or other video recording devices which capture footage that may be of use to us when investigating an incident.

"This system will prevent officers from making appointments to view the footage therefore giving them more time to carry out investigations and time on the streets responding to incidents."

The footage which is submitted must be less than 10 days old for it to be investigated. This then allows officers enough time to contact the vehicle owners. This is to comply with the Road Traffic Act.

The form is simple and straight forward to use. Footage can be uploaded and more information is available by clicking this link: https://www.derbyshire.police.uk/ro/report/rti/rti-a/report-a-road-traffic-incident/
