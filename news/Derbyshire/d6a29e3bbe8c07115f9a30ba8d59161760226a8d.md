A body found near the River Trent is believed to be that of missing Derby man Mohammed Ishtyaq.

Mr Ishtyaq was reported missing after a collision on Swarkestone Bridge on 11 January.

Extensive searches took place around Swarkestone Bridge and further downstream - utilising boats and drones - but he was unable to be located.

At 8am today (4 March) officers were called to reports that a body had been found near the River Trent at Weston on Trent.

Mr Ishtyaq's family have been made aware of the discovery and are being supported by specialist officers. Our thoughts are with them, as well as Mr Ishtyaq's friends, at this time.

A file is now being prepared for the coroner.
