We're appealing for information after an attempted robbery in Newhall, in which a man threatened a dog walker in a bid to steal his St Bernard.

The 39-year-old victim was walking his dog in Thorn Tree Lane shortly after 8.45pm yesterday evening (14 February) when he was approached and threatened by a man who demanded he hand over his dog.

There was a verbal altercation before the would-be robber ran off in the direction of Yew Tree Road and headed towards Laburnum Road.

He is described as white, in his twenties, with blonde hair and he was wearing a black Adidas tracksuit and grey trainers.

Anyone who witnessed the incident, or with information is asked to contact Detective Constable Qassum Hussain, quoting reference number 21*90652.
