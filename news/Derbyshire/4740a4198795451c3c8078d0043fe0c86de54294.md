We're appealing for information after a robbery in a Buxton park.

A 54-year-old man was walking his dog in Ashwood Park, in Bakewell Road sometime after 12:00am this morning (Thursday 7 May) when he was approached and threatened by two men.

The men stole the victim's wallet, which contained a quantity of cash.

The wallet is described as a brown leather bi-fold wallet, with an inside button pocket and is of sentimental value.

The attackers are described as follows:

Attacker 1: around 5ft 4ins tall and of slim build, aged approximately between 17 and 22, and wearing a North Face jacket and black Nike trainers. He had the lower half of his face covered.

Attacker 2: around 5ft 9ins tall of slim build, aged in his early to mid-twenties, and wearing a hoodie, with the hood pulled tightly around his face. He also wore black jogging bottoms with a white logo on the left thigh.
