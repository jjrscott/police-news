#### Due to the ongoing heavy rain there are a number of issues relating to flooding across the county.

Residents, businesses and visitors to Derbyshire are asked to check in with the local authority - either Derby City Council or Derbyshire County Council - for updates related to their area

**Derby City Council** updates

**Derbyshire County Council** updates

Residents and businesses can learn about about flood alerts in their area by visiting the **Environment Agency.**

If you come across a road that is closed, or you are unsure if it is safe to pass through it, it is imperative that should you come across flood water on your journey that you do not drive through it, turn back and find an alternative route.

Where roads have been closed, respect those signs, do not move them and do not attempt to travel on that route.

Where minor flooding has taken place and the water level is low and clearly passable, drive through at low speeds. The wave caused by a vehicle driving through water can cause water to be forced into properties causing them to be flooded where there would otherwise not be a problem.
