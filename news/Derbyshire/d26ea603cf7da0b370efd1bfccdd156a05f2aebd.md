We are trying to trace a red car which we believe burglars used when leaving the scene of the crime.

At about 2.30pm on Thursday 3 December, a group of men knocked on the door of a house in Duke Street, Creswell.

The homeowner, a woman in her 40s, let the men in and they took cash and a mobile phone before leaving.

The men, who were all wearing balaclavas, left in a red car which was parked nearby.

We want to hear from anyone who witnessed the men in the area, or who saw them arrive or leave in a red car.
