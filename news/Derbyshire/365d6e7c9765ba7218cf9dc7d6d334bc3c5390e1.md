We are trying to trace a quad-type vehicle which has been stolen from Stenson, but has been sighted in Chellaston.

Overnight between Saturday 14 November and the next day, someone has broken into stables in Twyford Road, Stenson.

They took a Quadzilla 50cc in blue with a white petrol tank.

The vehicle was sighted in Chellaston on Monday 16 November.

We are releasing this image of a similar Quadzilla and would ask residents to contact us if they see it in their neighbourhood.
