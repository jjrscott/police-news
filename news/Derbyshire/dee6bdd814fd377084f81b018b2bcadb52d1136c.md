Detectives investigating the theft of a van and parcels in Ironville have issued CCTV images of a man they wish to speak to in connection with the incident.

Further CCTV appeal following theft of van and parcels in Ironville

At 10am on Sunday 13 December it was reported that a Vauxhall Vivaro van had been stolen, after the driver got out to deliver a parcel on Victoria Street. A short time later, the van was recovered in the Riddings area.

Officers are also investigating the theft of a van at the same location between 1.15pm and 1.30pm on Thursday 26 November, in similar circumstances.

There was also an incident which we released CCTV footage of yesterday from Town Street, Pinxton on Wednesday 25 November.

A silver Peugeot Partner van containing parcels was stolen and the driver suffered injuries to his foot as he tried to stop the van from being taken. You can view that footage here: https://youtu.be/lFI8qH9LBhk

It is uncertain if the incidents are linked, but we are urging couriers to be alert and to make sure they lock their vehicles and remove the keys whenever they leave them to make a delivery, no matter how long they expect to be.
