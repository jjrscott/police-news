Two Albanian men have appeared at court after a large cannabis grow was found at a house in Ironville.

Officers from the Alfreton safer neighbourhood team raided the property in Cinder Bank yesterday (16 December) and found inside a cannabis grow with in excess of 1,000 plants spread across three floors and worth an estimated Â£1m.

At the house, two Albanian men in their 20s were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the production of cannabis and both were subsequently charged with the same offence.

Saimir Kullau, 23, of no fixed abode, and Marsel Sadja, 24, also of no fixed abode, both appeared at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court today (17 December) charged with being concerned in the production of cannabis and were remanded to prison.

Sergeant James Bowler, from Alfreton SNT, said: "Cannabis grows like this pose a serious risk to our communities.

"Often the grows will use bypassed electricity and will overload systems presenting a real possibility of a fire breaking out.

"These grows have been found in every type of building - from small terraced houses to large warehouses - but all pose a very real danger to the communities around them.

"As the local policing team, we rely on the community coming forward with information about these types of criminal activities.

"You can do so in confidence by using any of the below methods, as well as reporting anonymously via Crimestoppers."
