Detectives investigating an armed robbery in Simmondley, Glossop, are appealing for the public's help to identify those involved.

At 10.55pm on Saturday 7 March three masked men entered the Co-Op store in Pennine Road and threatened staff with knives.

The trio stole a large amount of cigarettes and a significant amount of cash.

Officers have been making enquiries and following a number of leads since the incident and we are releasing the images of the men involved, who had Mancunian accents, in the hope that people may recognise the clothing they are wearing.
