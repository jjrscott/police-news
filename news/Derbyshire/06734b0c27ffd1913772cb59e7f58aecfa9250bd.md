As part of Safer Internet Day on February 11, we are encouraging Derbyshire residents to take part in Derbyshire County Council's Digital MOT.

The MOT allows you to check your online safety, and identify actions that you may need to take to reduce your risk of being a victim of cybercrime.

By answering a few simple questions, you can find out the most important things you can do to protect yourself online.

The results are displayed in an 'MOT style' format, so:

 * RED is an alert and means they need to take urgent action to protect themselves safe online
 * AMBER is action that they are advised to take to keep themselves safe online
 * GREEN means they have already taken the most important steps to protect themselves, but there may be more they could do.

If your results come back as needing additional help and support, you will be able to book a one-to-one session through your local library which will be delivered by either library staff or Digital PCSOs.

The Digital MOT is now available on the Safer Derbyshire website.
