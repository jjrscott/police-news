We're appealing for witnesses after a serious collision in Draycott on Sunday 8 December.

We received a call just before 9.40pm to report that a black BMW 3 series had left the road and collided with a wall in Town End Road.

Two men in their fifties, the driver and passenger of the BMW, were cut out of the car by Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service. They were treated for serious injuries at the scene by paramedics and were taken to hospital where they both remain in a critical condition.

Officers investigating the collision would like to hear from anyone who has information about the incident.

In particular they are keen to obtain dash cam or CCTV footage, which may help with their enquiries.

If you were driving in the area with dash cam installed, or have private CCTV at a nearby property we would urge you to check your footage and to inform officers if it has captured the incident itself or the BMW travelling in the area.

Please download any footage to an external advice and store it securely for officers to view.

You should quote reference number 19*657058 in any correspondence.

If you have footage that may be useful for officers, please ensure it is securely download to another device and kept safely for them to view.
