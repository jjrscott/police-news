We're appealing for information after two men allegedly attempted to rob an elderly man in Newbold.

It happened around 1.45pm on Sunday 26 April near to a bus stop on Windermere Road.

The 74 year old was making his home, having recently left a nearby shop, when he was approached by two men.

They held out what is believed to have been a Stanley knife and demanded that the victim hand over his wallet.

He refused and the men ran off empty handed towards the main road at Littlemoor.

The offenders were wearing hooded tops and dark coloured jogging bottoms. One of the men is thought to have had a small bag.
