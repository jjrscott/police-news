Four people have been arrested and suspected drugs recovered during a warrant in Matlock.

Officers executed a warrant at a house in Hurst Rise on the afternoon of Saturday 27 February.

They found what they believed to be controlled drugs inside the house.

Four people were arrested on suspicion of possessing drugs with intent to supply and conspiracy to supply drugs. They were two men aged 41 and 40 and two women aged 38 and 40.

They were questioned and released while inquiries continue.

We're currently sharing the work we do across our communities as part of Operation Derbyshire.

Operation Derbyshire runs until the end of May. It will see officers and staff sharing with our communities the excellent work that is going on to tackle certain crime types in the county.

Operation Derbyshire will also highlight the work that we and our partners do to support victims and bring offenders to justice.
